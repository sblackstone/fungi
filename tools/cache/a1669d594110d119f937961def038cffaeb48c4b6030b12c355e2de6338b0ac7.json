'''''Marasmius alliaceus'''''), commonly known as the '''garlic parachute''', is one of the larger [[mushroom]]s formerly in the genus ''[[Marasmius]]'', having a beige [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of up to 4&nbsp;cm and a long tough slender [[stipe (botany)|stipe]]. It emanates a strong smell of [[garlic]], and this is the significance of the [[Latin]] species name, ''alliaceus''. It is distributed throughout Europe, being fairly common in some areas and quite rare in others.<ref name=Courtecuisse/><ref name=SF/>\n\n==Description==\nThe species can be described as follows:<ref name=Courtecuisse/><ref name=\"Bon\"/><ref name=Moser/>\n*The cap is beige, ochre or flesh-coloured and is 2\u20134&nbsp;cm in diameter, sometimes wrinkled, somewhat domed in the middle.\n*The gills are whitish and narrowly attached to the stem.\n*The spore powder is white.\n*The tough dark-coloured stem can be 15&nbsp;cm tall but is only up to 3&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n*The stem is velvety ([[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]]) and black below, though it may be brown near the top.\n\nThe strong taste and smell of garlic is a product of the separation of \u03b3-glutamyl-marismin.<ref name=Moser/> This mushroom is found in European woods (especially [[beech]] woods) from early summer to autumn, growing on fallen leaves and rotting wood.\n\n==Related species and naming==\nThis species was originally documented by [[Nikolaus Joseph Freiherr von Jacquin]] in 1773 and subsequently it was long known as ''Marasmius alliaceus'', a designation established by [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. It gave its name to the section ''Alliacei'' of genus ''Marasmius'' until following a 2005 paper it was decided to separate this group off into genus ''[[Mycetinis]]'' (see that page for more details).<ref name=Anton\u00edn/><ref name=SF/> The most likely species to be confused is the fairly common ''[[Mycetinis scorodonius]]'', which is distinguished by a bare shiny red-brown stem. ''[[Mycetinis querceus]]'' (illegitimate synonym: ''M. prasiosmus'') has a velvety stem like ''M. alliaceus'', but the colour is purple-brown.<ref name=Courtecuisse/><ref name=Mycorance/>\n\nRelated garlic-smelling species also occur in America; examples are ''[[Marasmius perlongispermus]]'' and ''[[Mycetinis copelandii]]''.<ref name=Halling/>\n\n==Edibility==\nThe cap of ''M. alliaceus'' is edible, but of limited culinary value due to its meagre flesh. It can be added to dishes to give a garlic flavour, which could be useful for people who are allergic to real garlic.<ref name=Mycorance/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Anton\u00edn>{{cite book |author1=Anton\u00edn, V. |author2=Noordeloos, M.

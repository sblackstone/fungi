It is a highly variable mushroom (hence \u201cdeceiver\u201d), and can look quite washed out, colorless and drab, but when younger it often assumes red, pinkish brown, and orange tones. The species is often considered by mushroom collectors to be a \u201cmushroom [[weed]]\u201d because of its abundance and plain stature.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe deceiver was first described by [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]ian naturalist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] in 1772 as ''Agaricus laccatus'',<ref>{{cite book | author = Scopoli, Giovanni Antonio | year = 1772 | title = Flora Carniolica|edition=2 |page=444}}</ref> before being given its current binomial name by [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]] in 1884. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] adjective ''laccatus'' \u201cvarnished\u201d or \u201cshining\u201d.<ref name=\"nilper\">{{cite book |vauthors=Nilson S, Persson O| year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page=36}}</ref> ''Clitocybe laccata'' is an old alternative name. Var. ''pallidifolia'', described by [[Charles Horton Peck]], is the commonest variety found in North America.\n\nIt is the [[type species]] of the [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] mushroom genus ''Laccaria''; where their relations lie among the gilled mushrooms is unclear, but they are currently classified in the family [[Hydnangiaceae]].\n\nThe deceiver gets its [[common name]] from its variable appearance. Other names include lacklustre laccaria, and, by the [[Zapotec people]], ''Beshia ladhi biinii'' (also the name of other members of ''[[Laccaria]]'').<ref name=\"Garibay07\" />\n== Description ==\nThe deceiver is a small mushroom with a [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|6|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter, convex when young and later flattening or even depressed in the center. It can be various shades of salmon pink, brick-red, or shades of orange or brown when moist or young, and duller and paler when dry. The fibrous [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|0.6\u20131|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide. The irregular [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are widely spaced and decurrent or adnexed, and of similar color to the cap, though whiten with spores as the mushroom matures. The [[spore print]] is white, and the round spiny [[basidiospore|spores]] are 7\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and has little taste.<ref name=\"Phillips06\">{{cite book| author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page=102}}</ref>\n\nFormerly considered a subspecies by French mycologist [[Ren\u00e9 Maire]], the close deceiver (''[[Laccaria proxima]]'') is a European relative with a fine scaly cap and found in wetter habitats.<ref name=\"Lamaison05\">{{cite book |title=The Great Encyclopedia of Mushrooms |last=Lamaison |first=Jean-Louis |author2=Polese, Jean-Marie  |year=2005 |publisher=K\u00f6nemann |isbn=3-8331-1239-5|page=83}}</ref> Microscopically, its spores are narrower and more oval-shaped.\n\nIn California, what was thought to be ''L.&nbsp;laccata'' under [[eucalyptus]] has turned out to be the Australian species ''[[Laccaria fraterna]]''.<ref>http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Laccaria_fraterna.html</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Laccaria laccata G4 (3).JPG|Cap\nFile:Laccaria laccata (4501591685).jpg|Cap\nFile:Laccaria laccata G4 (1).JPG|Gills and stipe\nFile:Waxy Laccaria - Laccaria laccata (29119117746).jpg| Gills\nFile:Illustrations of British Fungi (Hymenomycetes), to serve as an atlas to the \"Handbook of British Fungi\" (Pl. 139) (6055652565).jpg| ''L. laccata'' as ''Agaricus laccatus'' in Illustrations of British Fungi (Hymenomycetes), to serve as an atlas to the \"Handbook of British Fungi\".\n</gallery>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n''Laccaria laccata'' is found in scattered troops in wooded areas, and on [[heathland]] often in poor [[soil]]. It is very common in all of the northern [[temperate]] zones, but tends to favor cool weather. ''L.&nbsp;laccata'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l with several types of [[tree]]s, including members of the [[Pinaceae]] (Pines), [[Fagaceae]] (Beech), and [[Betulaceae]] (Birch). It is found across Europe and North America,<ref name=\"Arora2nd\">{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |page=172 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref> south into Mexico and Costa Rica. ''Laccaria'' species are mycorrhizal, and thought by some to be [[pioneer species]].\n\n== Edibility ==\nAlthough small, the deceiver is edible and mild-tasting.

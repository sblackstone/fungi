The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], or [[mushroom]]s, are characterized by their thick, red to brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s, red pores, and the strong bluing reaction observed when the mushroom tissue is injured or cut. The cap can reach diameters of up to {{convert|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} and the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick at maturity. This mushroom has been found in [[manzanita]] and [[madrone]] woodlands of central [[California]] north to southern [[Oregon]]. Although the [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is not known with certainty, it may be [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], and is not recommended for consumption.<ref name=CAboletes/> Other similar red-pored, bluing boletes from North America, including ''[[Rubroboletus eastwoodiae]]'', ''[[Boletus luridiformis]]'', and ''[[Boletus subvelutipes|B.&nbsp;subvelutipes]]'', can be distinguished from ''S.&nbsp;amygdalinus'' either by the color of the cap, the degree of reticulation (a network of raised ridges) on the stipe, or by location.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first named ''Boletus puniceus'' by [[Harry D. Thiers]] in 1965, based on specimens he found in [[Napa County]], California, on 23 November 1963.<ref name=Thiers1965/> In 1975, Thiers changed the name to ''Boletus amygdalinus'' (a ''[[nomen nudum]]'') as he discovered that the [[specific name (botany)|epithet]] had already been used for a [[Boletus puniceus|different bolete]] found in [[Yunnan, China]],<ref name=CAboletes/> published in 1948.<ref name=Chiu1948/> The fungus was transferred to ''[[Suillellus]]'' in 2014<ref name=\"Vizzini 2014\"/> after [[molecular phylogenetic]]s demonstrated that ''S.&nbsp;amygdalinus'' was in a lineage distinct from ''Boletus''.<ref name=\"Nuhn 2013\"/>\n\nIn [[Latin]], ''amygdaline'' means relating to or resembling an [[almond]].<ref name=OED/>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Boletus amygdalinus 79355.jpg\n| caption1  = The stipe is not reticulate.\n| image2    = Boletus amygdalinus 63513.jpg\n| caption2  = A collection from [[Forestville, California]] }}\n\n''Suillellus amygdalinus'' is a large solid mushroom with a convex to somewhat flattened, irregular [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] that can reach diameters of {{convert|6|to|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} at maturity.  The surface of the cap is dry, and matted with fibers; the cap color of young specimens is red, but the mushrooms typically change to more brownish tones as they mature. The margin of the cap starts out curved inwards (incurved) and gradually becomes curved downwards (decurved) with age. The pores on the underside of the cap are {{convert|0.5|to|1|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} wide, angular, and red or red-orange, while the tubes are {{convert|1|to|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Thiers1965/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] lacks a netted pattern ([[wikt:reticulate|reticulation]]) and is yellow in color but is often covered by red hairs, especially near the base. The stipe is either equal in width throughout, or thicker in the middle; it reaches dimensions of {{convert|5|\u2013|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. The base of the stipe is typically bent.<ref name=Thiers1965/>  The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and yellow in color, but like all parts of the mushroom, will stain blue immediately upon bruising or cutting.<ref name=CAboletes/> Both the odor and taste of the fruit bodies are mild.<ref name=CaliforniaFungi/>\n\nAlthough the [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of ''S.&nbsp;amygdalinus'' is not known with certainty, authorities often recommend to avoid consuming blue-staining, red-pored boletes, as several are [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]].<ref name=CAboletes/><ref name=Kuo2007/> The species was implicated in one group of poisonings in California in 1996\u201397, but because of the nature of the symptoms experienced, there was probably more than one type of mushroom consumed.<ref name=Yamada1998/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n[[File:Boletus amygdalinus 69306.jpg|thumb|right|The thick-walled ellipsoid spores contain [[vacuoles]].]]\n''Suillellus amygdalinus'' produces a dark olive-brown [[spore print]]. The [[basidiospore|spores]] are thick-walled, smooth, and [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to somewhat spindle-shaped, with dimensions of 11.2\u201316 by 5.2\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They become dark [[ochraceous]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]], and, because of the occasional presence of two large [[vacuole]]s, may appear as if they are two-celled. The [[basidia]] (the spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, contain numerous vacuoles, and measure 30\u201335 by 9\u201311&nbsp;\u00b5m. [[Cystidia]] are present on sides of the tubes, and they measure 45\u201354 by 10\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m. [[Clamp connection]]s are not present in the [[hyphae]] of ''S.&nbsp;amygdalinus''.<ref name=Thiers1965/>\n\nVarious [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical color tests]] can be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be ''S.&nbsp;amygdalinus''. A drop of dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) will turn the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the [[cap cuticle]] red, or darker. [[Ammonia]] (as [[ammonium hydroxide]], NH<sub>4</sub>OH) produces a dingy yellow on the flesh, and brown on the cap. [[Iron(II) sulfate|Iron sulphate]] (FeSO<sub>4)</sub> produces either no change to a pale grey color with both the flesh and the cuticle. [[Hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) causes the flesh to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the cuticle.<ref name=Thiers1965/><ref name=Baroni1970/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| header = Bolete lookalikes\n| align = right\n| image1 = Boletus erythropus1.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (100 * 1080 / 720) round 0}} \n| caption1 = ''Boletus luridiformis''\n| image2 = Boletus satanas.JPG\n| width2 = {{#expr: (100 * 1194 / 1192) round 0}}\n| caption2 = ''Rubroboletus satanas''\n| image3 = Boletus subvelutipes 53895.jpg\n| width3 = {{#expr: (100 * 1300 / 975) round 0}}\n| caption3 = ''Boletus subvelutipes''\n}}\n\nThere are several other red-pored, bluing boletes that could be confused with ''S.&nbsp;amygdalinus''. The poisonous European species ''[[Rubroboletus satanas]]'' and its North American counterpart ''[[Rubroboletus eastwoodiae|R.&nbsp;eastwoodiae]]'' have lighter colored caps and a reticulate pattern on the stipe.<ref name=Arora1986/> ''[[Boletus subvelutipes|B.&nbsp;subvelutipes]]'' is a highly variable species from eastern North America that includes red in its range of cap colors, and has a fuzzy coating of hairs near the base of its stipe; it may represent a group of species.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> Another similar species is ''[[Boletus luridiformis|B.&nbsp;luridiformis]]'', found in North America and Northern Europe under both broadleaf trees and conifers. Unlike ''S.&nbsp;amygdalinus'', however, ''B.&nbsp;luridiformis'' has a dark brown to nearly blackish-brown cap, and a yellow stipe with a dense covering of red pruina (dots).<ref name=Bessette2000/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Suillellus amygdalinus'' mushrooms grow on the ground in groups, or scattered about. The fungus has been reported from low-elevation [[hardwood forest]]s composed of [[live oak]], [[manzanita]] and [[madrone]] in [[California]],<ref name=CaliforniaFungi/> and [[Oregon]]. Fruiting occurs after the onset of [[autumn]] rains, usually between the October and January.<ref name=Bessette2000/>  The mushroom can be difficult to spot, as its cap is similar in coloring to the leaves of the madrone tree with which it is associated, and because the mushroom is frequently buried under leaves.<ref name=CAboletes/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of North American boletes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |author=Arora D. |year=1986 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |page=527 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86tM01VsFG0C&pg=RA1-PA527}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Baroni1970>{{cite journal |author=Baroni TJ. |year=1970 |title=Chemical spot-test reactions: boletes |journal=Mycologia |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=1064\u201376 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0070/005/1064.htm |jstor=3759138 |doi=10.2307/3759138}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette2000>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette AR, Bessette A, Roody WC |title=North American Boletes: A Color Guide to the Fleshy Pored Mushrooms |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |year=2000 |page=71 |isbn=0-8156-0588-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geiwy6Jf_ZcC&pg=PA72}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=CAboletes>{{cite book |title=California Mushrooms\u2014A Field Guide to the Boletes |publisher=Hafner Press |location=New York, New York |page=261 |year=1975 |author=Thiers HD. |url=http://www.mykoweb.com/boletes/species/Boletus_amygdalinus.html |isbn=978-0-02-853410-7}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=CaliforniaFungi>{{cite web | title=''Boletus amygdalinus'' |vauthors=Wood M, Stevens F | publisher=California Fungi | url=http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Boletus_amygdalinus.html | accessdate=2011-10-09}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Chiu1948>{{cite journal |author=Chiu WF. |title=The boletes of Yunnan |journal=Mycologia |year=1948 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=199\u2013231 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0040/002/0199.htm |jstor=3755085 |doi=10.2307/3755085}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kuo2007>{{cite book |author=Kuo M. |title=100 Edible Mushrooms |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |year=2007 |page=53 |isbn=978-0-472-03126-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/100ediblemushroo00kuom }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Nuhn 2013\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nuhn ME, Binder M, ((Taylor AFS)), Halling RE, Hibbett DS |title=Phylogenetic overview of the Boletineae |journal=Fungal Biology |year=2013 |volume=117 |issue=7\u20138 |pages=479\u2013511 |doi=10.1016/j.funbio.2013.04.008 |pmid=23931115}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=OED>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=amygdaline, ''adj''. |encyclopedia=The Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.oed.com |edition=3rd  |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2011-11-09}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Thiers1965>{{cite journal |author=Thiers HD. |year=1965 |title=California Boletes.

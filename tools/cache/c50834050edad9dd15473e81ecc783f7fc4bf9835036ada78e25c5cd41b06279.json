A large sturdy cream- or buff-coloured funnel-shaped mushroom, it grows in mixed woodlands, often in troops or fairy rings, one of which is over half a mile wide. Although edible, it could be confused with some poisonous species of similar colouration and size.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nFrench mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] initially described the trooping funnel as ''Agaricus geotropus'' in 1792, before [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] renamed it ''Clitocybe geotropa'' (a name by which it was long known) in 1872. Its specific epithet derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words {{lang|grc|\u03b3\u1fc6}}/''g\u0113'' \"earth\", and \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2/''tropos'' \"turn\".<ref name=Nilper1977>{{cite book |author1=Nilson, Sven |author2=Persson, Olle |year=1977 |title=Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-14-063006-6 |page=38}}</ref>\n\nFinnish mycologist Harri Harmaja proposed ''I. geotropa'' and twelve other ''Clitocybe'' species be split off into a new genus ''Infundibulicybe'', thus the new binomial name is ''Infundibulicybe geotropa''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Notes on ''Clitocybe s. lato'' (Agaricales) |author=Harmaja, Harri|year=2003|url=http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anb40-free/anb40-213.pdf|journal=Annales Botanici Fennici|volume=40|pages=213\u201318}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2Clitocybe geotropa.jpg|left|thumb|Young specimens with distinctly bossed small caps]]\n\n==Description==\nA cream- or [[Buff (colour)|buff]]-coloured mushroom, the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] may reach {{convert|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter.

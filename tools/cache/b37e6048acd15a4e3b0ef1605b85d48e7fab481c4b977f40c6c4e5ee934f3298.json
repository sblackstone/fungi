It is found in Europe and has been accidentally introduced to other countries under conifers and can be found growing in pine plantations. A fresco in the Roman town of [[Herculaneum]] appears to depict ''Lactarius deliciosus'' and is one of the earliest pieces of art to illustrate a fungus.<ref name = Ramsbottom1953/><ref>Loizides M., Kyriakou T., Tziakouris A.

An alternate North American name is orange latex milky.<ref name=Fergus2003/> Its Spanish name varies (n\u00edscalo, n\u00edcalo, robell\u00f3n...).<ref name=MacM1976/> Its [[Catalan language|Catalan]] name is ''rovell\u00f3'' (pl. ''rovellons''). In the [[Girona]] area, it is called a ''pinatell'' (in Catalan) because it is collected near wild [[pine]] trees; it is typically harvested in October following the late August rains. Both this and ''[[Lactarius deterrimus]]'' are known as \u00c7am melkisi or \u00c7intar in Turkey.<ref name=Sol99/><ref name=Gez00/> In [[Romania]], it is known as ''Rascovi'' and it can be found in the northern regions in autumn season.\n\n==Description==\n''Lactarius deliciosus'' has a carrot orange cap that is convex to vase shaped, inrolled when young, {{convert|4|to|14|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} across, often with darker orange lines in the form of concentric circles. The cap is sticky and viscid when wet, but is often dry. It has crowded decurrent gills and a squat orange stipe that is often hollow, {{convert|3|to|8|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} thick. This mushroom stains a deep green color when handled. When fresh, the mushroom exudes an orange-red latex or \"milk\" that does not change color.\n\nIn North America, this mushroom is often confused with ''[[Lactarius rubrilacteus]]'', which stains blue, exudes a red latex, and is also edible.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Lactarius deliciosus'' grows under [[conifer]]s on acidic soils and forms a mycorrhizal relationship with its host tree. It is native to the southern [[Pyrenees]] where it grows under Mediterranean pines, as well as throughout the Mediterranean basin in [[Portugal]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]] and elsewhere. Both this fungus and ''L. deterrimus'' are collected and sold in the [[\u0130zmir Province]] of southwestern Turkey, and the [[Antalya Province]] of the south coast.<ref name=Sol99/><ref name=Gez00/> In the island of [[Cyprus]], large numbers of ''Lactarius deliciosus'' are found in the high altitude ''[[Pinus nigra]]'' and ''[[Pinus brutia]]'' forests of the [[Troodos Mountains|Troodos]] mountain range, where locals hunt them with vigour, as this fungus is highly esteemed among the local delicacies.<ref>Loizides, M. (2008). A secret world: The fungi of Cyprus. Field Mycology 9 (3): 107-109. {{doi|10.1016/S1468-1641(10)60420-3}}.</ref>\n\nAfter [[molecular phylogenetics|analysing DNA]] from collections around the world, mycologists Jorinde Nuytinck, Annemieke Verbeken, and Steve Miller have concluded that ''L.&nbsp;deliciosus'' is a distinct European species that differs genetically, morphologically, and ecologically from populations in North America or Central America.<ref name=\"Nuytinck 2007\"/> It has been reportedly introduced to [[Chile]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], where it grows in ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' plantations. Popular places for collecting this mushroom, especially among the Polish community, are around Macedon in Victoria, and in the Oberon area in New South Wales, Australia, where they can grow to the size of a dinner plate. Many people of [[Italy|Italian]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and other eastern European ancestry in the states of Victoria and New South Wales, Australia travel to collect these mushrooms after autumn rainfall around Easter time.\n\n''Lactarius deliciosus'' is also very popular in Russian cuisine, and Siberian pine forests are a favourable habitat of this species. The mushrooms are being collected in August to early October, where they are traditionally fried, salted or pickled.\n\n==Edibility==\n[[File:Lactarius deliciosus sliced email.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sliced milk-caps, showing the orange milk appearing at mushroom edges]]\n''Lactarius deliciosus'' is a widely collected mushroom in the [[Iberian peninsula]], specially in the northern part of [[Catalonia]]. It is used in [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Catalan cuisine]]. One recipe recommends they should be lightly washed, fried whole cap down in olive oil with a small amount of [[garlic]] and served drenched in raw [[olive oil]] and [[parsley]]. The same recipe advised that [[butter]] should never be used when cooking this mushroom.\n\nFurther north and east it is a feature of [[Provence|Proven\u00e7al]] cuisine.<ref name=Olney1995/> They are also collected in Poland, where they are traditionally served fried in butter, with cream, or marinated. In [[Cyprus]], saffron milk cups are usually grilled on the charcoal and then dressed in olive oil and lemon or [[bitter orange]], they are saut\u00e9ed with onions, or sometimes stewed with onions, coriander and red wine. In [[Russian cuisine]] these mushrooms are traditionally preserved by salting.\n\nIn [[India]], the fungus is one of the ten most widely consumed mushrooms by ethnic tribes of [[Meghalaya]].<ref name=\"Khaund 2014\"/>\n\nIn most field guides, the saffron milk cap is considered an excellent mushroom, having 'a crisp texture'. Some authors, however, hold ''Lactarius sanguifluus'' in higher esteem than its pretender, ''Lactarius deliciosus''. Legend has it that when naming the mushroom, [[Carl Linnaeus]] had in fact mistaken it with ''[[Lactarius sanguifluus]]'', giving it the epithet \"delicious\".\n\nHigh consumption of ''Lactarius deliciosus'' could cause urine discoloration, namely coloring it orange/red<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=13072328 | volume=95 | title=[Temporary report on urine discoloration and antibiotic effect after eating Lactarius deliciosus L] | year=1953 | journal=Munch Med Wochenschr | pages=235\u20136}}</ref>\n\n==Chemistry==\nWhen grown in liquid culture, the mycelium of ''Lactarius deliciosus'' produces a mixture of [[fatty acid]]s and various compounds such as [[chroman-4-one]], [[anofinic acid]], [[3-hydroxyacetylindole]], [[ergosterol]], and cyclic [[dipeptide]]s.<ref name=\"Ayer 1994\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Ayer 1994\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ayer WA, Trifonov LS |title=Aromatic compounds from liquid cultures of ''Lactarius deliciosus'' |year=1994 |journal=Journal of Natural Products |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=839\u201341 |doi=10.1021/np50108a026}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Fergus2003>{{cite book |title=Common Edible & Poisonous Mushrooms of the Northeast |last=Fergus |first=C.

It is found in the United States, where it associates with [[Cupressus macrocarpa|cypress]] trees. It has been proposed for inclusion in the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIt was first [[species description|described]] in the literature in 1907 by [[Charles Horton Peck]], based on specimens found by {{nowrap|A.M. Patterson}}, a botany student at [[Stanford University]]. She found fruit bodies on Stanford campus in January, where they were growing under [[pine]] and cypress trees.<ref name=\"Peck 1907\"/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] was originally spelled \"Pattersonae\" by Peck, although this is now considered an [[orthographic variant]].<ref name=\"urlMyoBank: Agaricus pattersonae\"/> This species is placed in [[section (biology)|section]] ''Sanguinolenti'' of genus ''[[Agaricus]]''.<ref name=\"Kerrigan 1979\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], {{convert|5|\u2013|19|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, is initially almost hemispherical in shape, transforming to broadly convex and finally to flattened or with edges upturned in age. The cap surface is dry, with [[wikt:fibril|fibrils]] when young, but later the fibrils form large, dark brown [[wikt:appressed|appressed]] [[wikt: squamules|squamules]] (2\u20139&nbsp;mm long by 2\u20135&nbsp;mm broad). The cap color may be various shades of brown depending on the maturity of the specimen. The cap [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is typically {{convert|1|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, firm, white, and stains deep red 20\u201330 seconds after injury or bruising. The odor immediately after cutting is mild, faintly spicy, but several minutes may be described as 'fruity'. An [[edible mushroom]], the taste of ''A.&nbsp;pattersoniae'' is described as mild, pleasant, and slightly sweet.<ref name=\"Kerrigan 1979\"/>\n\nThe [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free in attachment, closely spaced, {{convert|5|\u2013|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad, and [[wikt: marginate|marginate]]. The light-cinnamon color in young specimens turns to a dark blackish brown in age after the spores develop. Bruised gills stain a [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] (wine-colored) red.<ref name=\"Kerrigan 1979\"/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is usually {{convert|8|\u2013|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2.5|\u2013|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick with a bulbous shape. The interior is hollow, with the internal cavity being between {{convert|5|\u2013|9|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. The stipe [[Trama (mycology)|context]] somewhat fibrous and white in color, except for the basal section which is yellowish. Bruising or cutting results in a red stain after a minute. The surface of the stipe is barely striate above the [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]], and smooth below except for fragments of the [[universal veil]]. During development the veils rupture and form an upper veil ([[partial veil]]), which initially hangs from the edge of the cap, and a lower veil. As the partial veil disintegrates, it often leaves fragments 2\u20133&nbsp;mm in size attached to the margin.<ref name=\"Kerrigan 1979\"/>\n\nThe [[spores]] are roughly elliptical in shape, 7\u20138.5 by 5.5\u20136.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]], which may be 1\u2013, 2\u2013, 3\u2013, or 4\u2013spored (although usually 4\u2013spored during active sporulation), are 26\u201334 by 7\u201311&nbsp;\u03bcm,  cylinder- to club-shaped, with [[sterigma]]ta that are 2\u20133&nbsp;\u03bcm long. Cheilocystidia are 12\u201332 by 6\u201315&nbsp;\u03bcm in size, almost cylindrical or club-shaped, and may appear clumped or continuous.<ref name=\"Kerrigan 1979\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Agaricus pattersoniae'' is associated with cypress (''[[Cupressus macrocarpa]]'') trees, where it fruits singly or in groups. Richard Kerrigan noted that it seems to be restricted to mature trees (age 40+ years) located in the coastal counties of [[California]],<ref name=\"Kerrigan 1979\"/> although [[Alexander H. Smith]] mentions that it has also been found in the [[Great Lakes]] regions.<ref name=\"Smith 1980\"/> The species has been proposed for inclusion in the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] as part of the Global Fungal Red List initiative. Its main threats include [[habitat destruction]], [[2012\u201315 North American drought#California|drought]], and decline of cypress trees due to cypress [[canker]] from infection by ''[[Seiridium cardinale]]''. The cypress trees have been removed from the type locality.<ref name=\"urlGRFL\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Agaricus species|List of ''Agaricus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Kerrigan 1979\">{{cite journal |author=Kerrigan RW |year=1979 |title=Studies in ''Agaricus'' I.

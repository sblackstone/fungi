Occurring in [[Europe]], ''A. virosa'' [[mycorrhiza|associates]] with various deciduous and coniferous trees. The large fruiting bodies (''i.e.'', the [[mushrooms]]) appear in summer and autumn; the [[Pileus (mycology)|caps]], [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]s and [[Lamella (mycology)|gill]]s are all white in colour.\n\nImmature specimens of ''A. virosa'' resemble several edible species commonly consumed by humans, increasing the risk of accidental [[poison]]ing. Small specimens may resemble the common [[Portobello mushroom]] to non-experts, but just one cap of ''A. virosa'' is enough to kill an adult human.<ref name=benjamin>{{cite book|last1=Benjamin|first1=Denis R|title=Mushrooms: Poisons and Panaceas : a Handbook for Naturalists, Mycologists, and Physicians|date=1995|publisher=W.H.

This [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] has been applied to all-white destroying angels occurring in North America, though others propose these all belong to ''[[Amanita bisporigera]]'' and other rarer species instead. There has been some question over whether ''[[Amanita verna]]'' is a valid species.\n\n==Description==\n''Amanita virosa'' first appears as a white egg-shaped object covered with a universal [[Veil (botany)|veil]]. As it grows, the mushroom breaks free, though there may be ragged patches of veil at the cap edges. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially conical with inturned edges, before becoming hemispherical and flattening with a diameter up to {{convert|12|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}. The cap often has a distinctive boss; it is able to be peeled and white, though the centre may be ivory in colour. The crowded free [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white, as is the stipe and [[Volva (mycology)|volva]]. The thin [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, with a hanging grooved ring. The [[spore print]] is white and the spores egg-shaped conical and 7\u201310&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]] long. They stain blue with [[iodine]]. The flesh is white, with a taste reminiscent of radishes, and turns bright yellow with [[sodium hydroxide]].<ref name =\"Zeitl\">{{cite book|last=Zeitlmayr|first= Linus|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms:An Illustrated Handbook|pages=62\u201363|publisher=Garden City Press|location=Hertfordshire|isbn= 978-0-584-10324-3}}</ref>\n\nThis fungus highlights the danger of picking immature fungi as it resembles the edible mushrooms ''[[Agaricus arvensis]]'' and  ''[[Agaricus campestris|A. campestris]]'', and the puffballs (''[[Lycoperdon]]'' spp. ) before the caps have opened and the gills have become visible.\n\nThe ability to be peeled has been taken as a sign of edibility in mushrooming, which is a potentially lethal mistake in this species.

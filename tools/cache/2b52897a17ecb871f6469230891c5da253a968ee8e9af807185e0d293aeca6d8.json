The mushrooms have parachute-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] which start off darkly grayish-brown, changing to grayish-yellow or pale grayish-brown with a pale white ring at the edge when mature, and reach up to {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.  Their thin, cylindrical, hollow, fragile [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to  {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter are covered in a thick gel and emit a constant yellow-green [[bioluminescence]] (the caps do not glow). The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are attached.  The mushroom has a slightly radish-like smell and similar slightly bitter taste.  It has been assigned the [[MycoBank]] number MB 515160.<ref name=R1>{{Cite journal | last=Desjardin | first=Dennis E. | authorlink=  |author2=Brian A. Perry |author3=D. Jean Lodge |author4=Cassius V.

It grows on decomposing twigs, rarely on dead leaves or undergrowth, in clusters of two-to-twenty individuals.  Dennis Desjardin is credited with the discovery.<ref name=R1/>\n\n==Uses==\nThe eternal light mushroom has no known nutritional value, contains no known [[hallucinogens]], and is not reported as having any particular cultural significance. Its extreme rarity means that it has never been common in cooking.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bioluminescent fungi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Mycena luxaeterna}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3278966}}\n\n[[Category:Bioluminescent fungi]]\n[[Category:Mycena|luxaeterna]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 2010]]"}]}}}}

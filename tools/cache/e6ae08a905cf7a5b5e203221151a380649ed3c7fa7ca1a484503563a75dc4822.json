The species was officially described in 1912 by mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]], along with three other ''[[Agaricus]]'' species that have since been placed in [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] with ''A.&nbsp;hondensis''. Found in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America, ''A.&nbsp;hondensis'' fruits in the fall under [[conifer]]s or in [[mixed forest]]s.\n\nThe fungus produces [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) with white to gray-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter covered with pale pinkish-brown scales that darken in age. The tightly-packed [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the cap underside are initially white before becoming pinkish, [[lilac (color)|lilac]]-gray, and finally brownish as the [[spore]]s mature.  The stout [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is bulbous and has a thick, white, felt-like [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The mushroom is [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], and causes severe gastrointestinal upset if consumed. It has an unpleasant odor similar to [[phenol]] or [[creosote]], and develops a soapy-metallic taste when cooked. ''Agaricus hondensis'' can be distinguished from similar ''Agaricus'' species by differences in geographic range, habitat, staining reaction, and odor.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] as new to science by American mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1912, based on collections he made in November, 1911 under Californian [[Sequoioideae|redwoods]]. In the same publication, Murrill also described the species ''Agaricus bivelatoides'', ''A.&nbsp;hillii'', and ''A.&nbsp;macmurphyi'', all from the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America. The latter two were named to honor their original collectors, Albert Hill and [[James Ira Wilson McMurphy]], respectively, while the former was named for its resemblance to ''[[Agaricus bivelatus|A.&nbsp;bivelatus]]''.<ref name=\"Murrill 1912\"/> In 1944, [[Alexander H. Smith]] examined the type material of several of Murrill's species, and concluded that were no [[phenotypic trait|characters]] to separate ''A.&nbsp;hondensis'' from ''A.&nbsp;bivelatoides'', ''A.&nbsp;hillii'', or ''A.&nbsp;macmurphyi''. He also determined that [[Sanford Myron Zeller]]'s ''A.&nbsp;glaber'', published as new in 1938,<ref name=\"Zeller 1938\"/> was also the same species as ''A.&nbsp;hondensis''.<ref name=\"Smith 1944\"/> The nomenclatural database [[MycoBank]] considers these names [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]].<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Agaricus hondensis\"/> The [[specific name (botany)|epithet]] ''hondensis'' refers to the [[type (biology)|type]] location, [[La Honda, California]].<ref name=\"Murrill 1912\"/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"felt-ringed agaricus\".<ref name=\"Ammirati 1985\"/>\n\n''Agaricus hondensis'' has traditionally been [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Xanthodermatei'', a grouping of ''Agaricus'' species related to ''[[Agaricus xanthodermus|A.&nbsp;xanthodermus]]'' that are characterized by fruit bodies with [[phenol]]ic odors, temporary yellowing discolorations in some parts of the fruit body, a negative [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification#Schaeffer\u2019s test|Schaeffer\u2019s reaction]], and [[Mushroom poisoning|toxicity]]. A [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis has shown that it, along with the related species ''[[Agaricus freirei|A.&nbsp;freirei]]'' and ''[[Agaricus phaeolepidotus|A.&nbsp;phaeolepidotus]]'', comprise a [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] lineage in a [[clade]] of related [[wikt:sylvan|sylvan]] species that have weak yellowing reactions and some tendencies toward reddish bruising reactions. This lineage is closely related to a group of ''Agaricus'' species that are typically placed in the section ''Sanguinolenti''. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that these three species belong to a clade that [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] shortly after the presumed split of the sections ''Xanthodermatei'' and ''Duploannulati''.<ref name=\"Kerrigan 2005\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Agaricus hondensis 300272.jpg|thumb|left|The thick, skirtlike ring flares outward from the stipe.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially convex before flattening out, and reaches a diameter of {{convert|6|\u2013|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The dry and smooth cap surface is whitish or has pale pinkish-brown to pinkish-gray to [[fawn (colour)|fawn]]-colored flattened fibrils or fine [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] scales (at least in the center). In maturity, the fibrils usually darken to brown, reddish-brown, or reddish-gray, but in one northern form the fibrils are darker brown from the beginning. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick and white. When bruised or injured, the flesh either does not change color, or may stain pale yellowish, then often slowly discolors pinkish. The odor of the crushed flesh is mild or faintly phenolic, but is usually distinctly phenolic in the base of the stipe.<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially pale pinkish to pinkish-gray before becoming brown, then chocolate-brown or darker when the [[spore]]s mature. In maturity, the gills are free from attachment to the stipe, and are packed close together with little intervening spaced between them. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|7|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|1|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick but with a thicker or bulbous base. Firm, smooth, and lacking the scales found on the cap, the stipe is white but discolors dingy pinkish or brownish in age or after handling. The flesh in the extreme base usually stains pale yellowish when bruised. The [[partial veil]] is membranous, white, and forms a thick, felt-like [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the upper portion of the stipe. The ring is skirtlike but often flares outward instead of collapsing against the stipe.<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/> A drop of dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] placed on the cap turns yellow.<ref name=\"urlMushroomExpert\"/>\n[[File:Agaricus hondensis spores 1000x Alan Rockefeller.JPG|thumb|''Agaricus hondensis'' spores (1000x)]]\n[[Spore print]]s are purplish brown to chocolate brown. The smooth, thick-walled [[basidiospore|spores]] are broadly [[ellipsoidal]], and typically measure 5.8\u20137.3 by 3.7\u20134.4&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, [[hyaline]] (translucent, and measure 20\u201321.3 by 5.8\u20137.0&nbsp;\u03bcm.

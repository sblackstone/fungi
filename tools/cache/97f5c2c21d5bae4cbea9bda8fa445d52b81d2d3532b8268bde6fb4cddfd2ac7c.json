A rather large [[mushroom]], it may reach dimensions of up to {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad by {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall. It is [[common name|commonly known]] as the '''mosaic puffball''', a reference to the polygonal-shaped segments the outer surface of the [[fruiting body]] develops as it matures. Widespread in northern [[temperate]] zones, it is found frequently on pastures and sandy [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s, and is [[edible mushroom|edible]] when young. ''H.&nbsp;utriformis'' has [[antibiotic]] activity against a number of bacteria, and can [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] the trace metals [[copper]] and [[zinc]] to relatively high concentrations.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThis puffball was originally described in 1790 by French botanist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard]] as ''Lycoperdon utriforme'', and since then, has been variously placed in the genera ''[[Bovista]]'', ''[[Lycoperdon]]'', ''[[Calvatia]]'', and ''[[Utraria]]''. In 1989, German mycologist Hanns Kreisel described the genus ''Handkea'' to include species of ''Calvatia'' that had distinct microscopic features: ''Handkea'' species have a unique type of [[capillitium]] (coarse thick-walled [[hyphae]] in the [[gleba]]), with curvy slits instead of the usual pores.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kreisel H|year=1989|title=Studies in the ''Calvatia'' complex (basidiomycetes)|journal=Nova Hedwigia|volume=48|issue=3\u20134|pages=281\u201396}}</ref> Although accepted by some authors,<ref name=\"isbn0-947643-81-8\">{{cite book|vauthors=Laess\u00f8e T, Pegler DN, Spooner B |title=British puffballs, earthstars and stinkhorns: an account of the British gasteroid fungi|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens|location=Kew|year=1995|isbn=0-947643-81-8}}</ref> the genus concept has been rejected by others.<ref name=Demoulin1990/>\n\nIn the past, the species (when it was known as ''Calvatia utriformis'') has been separated into three [[variety (botany)|varieties]] (''C.&nbsp;utriformis'' var.

The flesh ([[gleba]], or spore bearing mass) is white when young, but becomes brown and powdery upon maturity. The upper skin eventually disintegrates weeks or even months after the puffball's appearance, and the brown spores are released into the air; this process is often hastened by rain, or by being trodden on by cattle.

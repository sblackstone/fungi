It is closely related to ''[[Psilocybe subaeruginascens|P. subaeruginascens]]'' from [[Java]], ''[[Psilocybe septentrionalis|P. septentrionalis]]'' from [[Japan]], and ''[[Psilocybe wayanadensis|P. wayanadensis]]'' from [[India]]. \nThis mushroom was first documented by [[Richard V. Gaines]] in [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]] in June 2003.\nAlthough it is sometimes confused with ''[[Psilocybe caerulipes]]'', it can be distinguished by its [[rhomboid]] spores, larger stature, earlier fruiting season and membranous [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]].\n\n==Etymology==\nFrom the abundant ovoid [[pleurocystidia]] and [[cheilocystidia]].\n\n== Description ==\n*'''Cap''': 1 \u2014 4.5&nbsp;cm across, [[wikt:convex|convex]] to [[subumbonate]], chestnut or orangish brown to yellowish brown to pearly cream color, [[hygrophanous]], [[glabrousness (botany)|glabrous]], [[sub-viscid]], translucent-striate near the margin, from slightly to highly undulated in maturity, with irregular yellowish, brownish, or bluish tones, sometimes white when dry. Flesh thick, pliant. Bruises blue and green where injured. \n*'''Gills''': [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] attachment and range from whitish to rusty brown, lavender, or dark purple brown. \n*'''Spore print''': Dark purple brown.\n*'''Stipe''': 1.5 \u2013 9&nbsp;cm by 1 \u2013 7&nbsp;mm, equal, somewhat [[subbulbous]], hollow, base sometimes [[wikt:hypogeous|hypogeous]], smooth at the top and often having small scales near the bottom, colored whitish with irregular yellowish, brownish, or bluish tones. The partial veil is variable, ranging from a thin [[Partial veil|cortina]] that leaves a barely perceptible annular zone, to a substantial membrane that leaves a fairly persistent [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]].\n*'''Taste''': [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]]\n*'''Odor''': [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] to spicy\n*'''Microscopic features''': Spores (7\u2013) 8\u20139 (\u201312) \u00d7 ( 5.5 \u2013 ) 6 \u2013 7 (\u20138.5) [[micrometers|\u00b5m]], rhomboid to subrhomboid in face view, subellipsoid in side view, thick-walled, with the wall 0.8 to 1.5 [[micrometers|\u00b5m]] thick.  One end of the spore has a broad germ pore and the other side has a short hilar appendage.  Two types of [[cheilocystidia]] and [[pleurocystidia]] are present.  One type of pleurocystidia measures 16 - 24 x 6 - 8 and is venstricose-rostrate.  The other type is larger, 20 - 40 micrometers by 12 - 16 micrometers, globose-pyriform, sometimes with a narrow apex and narrow base.  The [[basidia]] are 4 spored and measure 20 \u2013 28 \u00d7 7 \u2013 9 [[micrometers|\u00b5m]].<ref name=\"Guzman2007\"/>\n\n==Habitat and formation==\n[[File:Psilocybe.ovoideocystidiata.green.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wild ''Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata'']]\n''Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata''  is mainly native to the eastern United States, in a range that stretches from [[Kentucky]] to [[Rhode Island]], but has been found as far south as [[Mississippi (U.S. state)|Mississippi]]. It is common in the [[Ohio river]] valley, here it is often found in the woody debris of overflow areas, along rivers and streams. More generally, it is often found in man-made [[mulch]] and [[wood chips]]. More recently, it has turned up in the western United States, in the Pacific States from [[Western Washington]] to [[Southern California]], though it is still a relatively uncommon species in this region. It has also been reported from Europe, specifically in [[Switzerland]] and southern [[Germany]]. Seasonality varies a great deal depending on what region they are found in, but in the northeastern US, are most common from April to mid June but they occasionally fruit as late as November.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Psilocybin mushrooms]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Guzman2007\">{{cite journal |first1=Gast\u00f3n |last1=Guzm\u00e1n |authorlink1=Gast\u00f3n  Guzm\u00e1n |first2=Richard V. |last2=Gaines |first3=Florencia |last3=Ram\u00edrez-Guill\u00e9n |title=New Species of Hallucinogenic ''Psilocybe'' (Fr.)

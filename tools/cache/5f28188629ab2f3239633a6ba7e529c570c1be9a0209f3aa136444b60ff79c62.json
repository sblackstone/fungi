Sing.\n}}\n'''''Tricholomopsis rutilans''''', known by the unusual but apt common name of '''Plums and Custard''' or, less commonly '''Red-haired agaric''', is a species of [[Agaricales|gilled mushroom]] found across Europe and North America.\n\n==Description==\nA striking and easily recognised fungus, Plums and Custard  takes its common name from its plum-red scaled cap and crowded custard yellow gills.  The flesh is cream-coloured and spore print creamy white. The base colour of the cap under the scales is yellow. The cap is convex and 4&ndash;10&nbsp;cm (1.5&ndash;4&nbsp;in) across. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (stem) is cylindrical and up to 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) tall with a red scaly base developing to a yellow colour towards the cap. It has no ring or [[volva (mycology)|volva]].\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[Image:Tricholomopsis.rutilans.-.lindsey.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]\n''Tricholomopsis rutilans'' can be found growing on tree stumps and logs (especially those of spruce) in coniferous woodlands throughout the northern hemisphere, in places as diverse as [[Ireland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Ukraine]] and North-West Russia, in late summer and autumn (June until November). It has also been found, probably accidentally introduced, in [[Australia]] and [[Costa Rica]] on introduced pine trees. A related species ''[[Tricholomopsis decora]]'' is also found in conifer woods but is golden in colour, much less common and found at higher altitudes.\n\n==Edibility==\n{{mycomorphbox \n| name = Tricholomopsis rutilans\n| hymeniumType=gills\n| capShape = convex\n| whichGills = adnate \n| stipeCharacter=bare\n| sporePrintColor=cream\n| ecologicalType=saprotrophic\n| howEdible=inedible}}\nMany older texts list ''T. rutilans'' as apparently able to be eaten after boiling, though not recommended. A couple of more recent books list it as inedible.{{why|date=October 2015}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | author = Breitenbach J & Kr\u00e4nzlin F | year = 1991 | title = Fungi of Switzerland 3: Boletes & Agarics, 1st Part | isbn = 978-3-85604-230-1}}\n* Fuhrer B.

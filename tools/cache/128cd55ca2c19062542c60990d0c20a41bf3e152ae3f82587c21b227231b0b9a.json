It is named after the German naturalist [[Ferdinand von Hochstetter]].\n\n==Description==\n''Entoloma hochstetteri'' has a small delicate [[epigeous]] (above-ground) [[fruiting body]] (basidiocarp) which may be found among moss or leaf litter. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] may be up to 4&nbsp;cm (1.4&nbsp;in) in diameter and conical in shape. The cap color is indigo-blue with a green tint, and is [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]]. The cap margin is striate and rolled inwards. The gill attachment is [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] or [[Emarginate gills|emarginate]], gills are thin and 3\u20135&nbsp;mm wide, essentially the same color as the cap, sometimes with a yellow tint. The cylindrical [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is up to 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) long by 0.5&nbsp;cm thick, fibrillose and stuffed. The [[spore print]] is reddish-pink. The [[spore]]s are 9.9\u201313.2 by 11.8\u201313.2 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]], tetrahedric in shape, [[hyaline]], smooth and thin-walled. The [[basidium|basidia]] are 35.2\u201344.2 by 8.8\u201313.2&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, [[hyaline]], and with two or four sterigmata.<ref name=Dhancholia>Dhancholia S.

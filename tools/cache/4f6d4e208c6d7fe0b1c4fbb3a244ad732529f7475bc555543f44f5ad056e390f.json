However, molecular analysis showed in 2004 that these two varieties of truffle are one [[species]]. The differences between them are therefore likely due to environmental factors.<ref name=\"Hall 61\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=taQGqqcaEYoC&pg=PA61 Hall et al., 61-63]</ref><ref>Paolocci et al.</ref>\n\nThis article uses the older of the two [[binomial name]]s, ''T. aestivum'', to designate the species,<ref>As recommended by Hall et al., 63.</ref> while discussing the characteristics of the two varieties separately.\n\n==Burgundy truffles==\nBurgundy truffles ({{lang-fr|truffe de Bourgogne}}; {{lang-it|tartufo nero di [[Fragno]]}} or ''scorzone'', \"bark\"; {{lang-es|trufa de verano}}; {{lang-sv|svart sommartryffel}}), have an intense, [[hazelnut]]-like aroma and are highly prized for their gastronomic qualities. They are used in the ''[[haute cuisine]]'' of France and Italy, as well as a substitute for the P\u00e9rigord black truffle (''[[Tuber melanosporum|T. melanosporum]]''). Like other truffles, they are also canned and bottled for export.<ref name=\"Hall  61\" />\n\nWith bodies ([[ascocarp]]s) from {{convert|2|cm|in|0}} to {{convert|10|cm|in|0}} in diameter, burgundy truffles are relatively large. Their brown or black outer skin ([[peridium]]) forms pyramidal warts about 3 to 9&nbsp;mm wide, resembling rough [[Bark (botany)|bark]].<ref name=\"Hall  61\" />\n\nBurgundy truffles are harvested from September to late December, sometimes also until late January.<ref name=\"Hall  61\" /> They have a wider distribution than any other truffle species. Burgundy truffles are found across Europe, from Spain to eastern Europe and from Sweden to North Africa. In France they are found mainly in the north-east and in Italy, in the north. In the United Kingdom they were plentiful prior to the 20th century, but are now rare. Their distribution may not yet be definitively established: there are as of 2007 unconfirmed reports of findings in China.<ref name=\"Hall 106\" />\n\n==Summer truffles==\nThe flavor, size and color of summer truffles ({{lang-it|tartufo estivo}}) is similar to that of burgundy truffles, but their aroma is less intense and the flesh ([[gleba]]) is a paler hazel color.<ref name=\"Hall  61\" />\n\nAs their name suggests, summer truffles are harvested earlier than burgundy truffles, from May to August.<ref name=\"Hall  61\" /> They are most often found in the southern part of the distribution area of the species, notably in the [[Mediterranean climate]] areas of France, Italy and Spain.<ref name=\"Hall 106\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Tuber (fungus) species|List of ''Tuber'' species]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Ian R.|title=Taming the truffle: the history, lore, and science of the ultimate mushroom|year=2007|publisher=Timber Press|isbn=978-0-88192-860-0|author2=Gordon Thomas Brown|author3=Alessandra Zambonelli|chapter=Burgundy or Summer Truffle|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/tamingtrufflehis00hall}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Paolocci|first=Francesco|author2=Andrea Rubini |author3=Claudia Riccioni |author4=Fabiana Topini |author5=Sergio Arcioni |title=''Tuber aestivum'' and ''Tuber uncinatum'': two morphotypes or two species?|journal=[[FEMS Microbiology Letters]]|date=June 2004|volume=235|issue=1|pages=109\u2013115|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2004.tb09574.x|pmid=15158269}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Gryndler|first=Milan |author2=Hana Hr\u0161elov\u00e1 |author3=Lucie Soukupov\u00e1 |author4=Eva Streiblov\u00e1 |author5=Slavom\u00edr Valda |author6=Jan Borovi\u010dka |author7=Hana Gryndlerov\u00e1 |author8=J\u00e1n Ga\u017eo |author9=Mari\u00e1n Miko|title=Detection of summer truffle (''Tuber aestivum'' Vittad.) in ectomycorrhizae and in soil using specific primers|journal=[[FEMS Microbiology Letters]]|date=May 2011|volume=318|issue=1|pages=84\u201391|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02243.x|pmid=21385201}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Footnotes===\n*{{commons category inline|Tuber aestivum}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q74692|from2=Q3541785}}\n\n[[Category:Tuber (fungus)]]\n[[Category:Truffles (fungi)]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1831]]"}]}}}}

The dark reddish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of the [[sporocarp (fungus)|fruit bodies]] develop a characteristic saddle-shape in maturity, and the ends of both saddle lobes are drawn out to sharp tips that project above the level of the fruit body. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white or flushed pale brown, smooth on the outside, but hollow with some chambers inside. It is found in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], usually in the late summer and autumn, growing on rotting wood or on hard packed ground. ''G.&nbsp;infula'' is considered inedible as it contains the toxic compound [[gyromitrin]], which, when metabolized by the body, is converted into [[monomethylhydrazine]], a component of some rocket fuels. The toxin may be removed by thorough cooking. ''[[Gyromitra]]'' fungi are included in the informal category \"[[false morel]]s\".\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThe fungus was first [[species description|described]] in 1774 by German mycologist [[Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer]] as ''Helvella infula'' (the original genus spelling was ''Elvela'').<ref name=Schaeffer1774/> In 1849, [[Elias Magnus Fries]] established the genus ''[[Gyromitra]]'', distinguishing it from ''Helvella'' based on a gyrose [[hymenium]] (marked with wavy lines or convolutions); the genus was based on the [[type species]] ''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]''.<ref name=Fries1849/>  Later, in 1886, French mycologist [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] transferred the species to ''Gyromitra''. The next few decades witnessed some lingering confusion as to the correct [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] placement of these fungi. In 1907, [[Jean Louis \u00c9mile Boudier|Jean Boudier]] moved both ''G.&nbsp;esculenta'' and ''H.&nbsp;infula'' into a newly created genus he called ''Physomitra''; he retained the genus ''Gyromitra'' but \"based it on an entirely different character so as to exclude from the genus the very species on which it was founded\".<ref name=Seaver1920/> In an attempt to reconcile the confusion surrounding the naming and identity of the two mushrooms, [[Fred J. Seaver]] proposed that both were [[synonym (biology)|synonymous]], representing variable forms of the same species.<ref name=Seaver1920/> His suggestion was not adopted by later mycologists, who identified various differences between the two species, including fruiting time as well as macroscopic and microscopic differences.<ref name=Kanouse1948/><ref name=Groves1953/>\n\nThe [[genus]] name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''gyros''/\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \"round\" and ''mitra''/\u03bc\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 \"headband\";<ref name=\"Liddell 1980\"/> the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is  from the [[Latin]] ''inf\u01d4la'', a heavy band of twisted wool worn by Roman officiants at sacrifices.<ref name=Simpson1979/> It is known more commonly as the elfin saddle<ref name=\"urlGyromitra infula & Gyromitra ambigua (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/> or the hooded false morel.<ref name=Evenson1997/> Additionally, ''G.&nbsp;infula'' is a member of a group of fungi collectively known as \"[[false morel]]s\", so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded edible [[Morel|true morels]] of the genus ''[[Morchella]]''. This group includes other species of the genus ''Gyromitra'', such as ''G.&nbsp;esculenta'' (brain mushroom), ''[[Gyromitra caroliniana|G. caroliniana]]'' (beefsteak mushroom) and ''[[Gyromitra gigas|G. gigas]]'' (snow morel).\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Gyromitra infula sasata.JPG|thumb|160px|left|<center>''G. infula''</center>]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the fruit body (technically an [[apothecium]]) is up to {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide and is reddish brown, and somewhat saddle-shaped with 2\u20134 lobes. It frequently develops blackish-brown spots on the surface. During the development of the mushroom, the periphery of the cap grows into the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] below, to form a hollow, roughly bell-shaped structure with the fertile spore-bearing surface (the [[hymenium]]) on the outside; as the surface growth of the hymenium continues to expand even after joining to the stipe, the hymenium can no longer follow and it arches up into folds and pads.<ref name=Gaumann1928/> The stipe, typically between {{convert|2|\u2013|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|1|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, can be various colors from reddish brown to whitish or even bluish, but is typically lighter colored than the cap.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Gyromitra infula\"/> The stipe is minutely [[tomentose]] \u2013 covered with a layer of very fine hairs. The [[Trama (mycology)|context]] is thin (1\u20132&nbsp;mm) and brittle.<ref name=Wells1968/> ''G.&nbsp;infula'' does not have any appreciable odor or taste.\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n\n[[Ascospore]]s are [[ellipsoid]]al in shape, [[hyaline]], smooth, thin-walled, with dimensions of 17\u201322 by 7\u20139&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]].<ref name=Tylutki1979/> They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets at either end. The spore-producing cells, the [[Ascus|asci]], are roughly cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an apical lid to discharge the spores) and have dimensions of 200\u2013350 by 12\u201317&nbsp;|\u00b5m.<ref name=\"Wells1968\" /> The diameter of the club-shaped [[paraphyses]] is 7\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m at the apex.\n\n===Edibility===\n\nThis fungus is inedible, as it contains the toxic compound [[gyromitrin]],<ref name=Tylutki1979/> which when digested is metabolized into [[monomethylhydrazine]].<ref name=\"urlwww.uaf.edu\"/> Although much of the gyromitrin may be removed by [[parboiling]] with generous volumes of water, consumption is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects\u2014there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative [[carcinogenic]] effect.<ref name=\"urlwww.uaf.edu\" />\n\n===Similar species===\n\n''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'' has a wrinkled surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like ''G.&nbsp;infula''. ''[[Gyromitra ambigua]]'' is very similar in appearance, and although it is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics,<ref name=Kempton1973/> ''G.&nbsp;ambigua'' is said to have more pronounced purple tints in the stipe.<ref name=Smith1980/> ''G.&nbsp;ambigua'' has larger spores that are about 22\u201330&nbsp;\u00b5m long.<ref name=Ammirati2009/> The saddle-shaped cap of ''G.&nbsp;infula'' might also lead to confusion with some species of ''[[Helvella]]'', but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes.\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\nThis fungus can be found growing singly to scattered in or near [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous woodland]] in autumn, often on rotten wood.<ref name=Persson1978/><ref name=Arora1986/> It is also commonly found on packed ground, such as beside country roads, or in campgrounds.<ref name=Smith1975/> Associated [[conifer]]s include ''[[Picea glauca]]'', ''[[Picea mariana]]'', ''[[Picea sitchensis]]'', ''[[Pinus contorta]]'', ''[[Pinus banksiana]]'', ''[[Pinus monticola]]'', ''[[Abies balsamea]]'', ''[[Abies grandis]]'', ''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'', ''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'', ''[[Larix occidentalis]]'', ''[[Thuja plicata]]'', as well as the deciduous tree species ''[[Populus balsamifera]]'', ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'', ''[[Acer macrophyllum]]'', ''[[Alnus]]'' species, and ''[[Betula papyrifera]]''.<ref name=Abbott1992/>\n\n''Gyromitra infula'' is widely distributed throughout [[taiga|boreal]], [[montane]] and coastal forests in North America.<ref name=Groves1954/> The North American range extends north to Canada<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> and south to Mexico.<ref name=Medel2005/> It has also been reported from South America,<ref name=Kew1970/> Europe,<ref name=Harmaja1969/> and Asia.<ref name=Korf1991/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Ammirati2009>{{cite book |author=Ammirati J, Trudell S. |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest: Timber Press Field Guide (Timber Press Field Guides) |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2009 |page=280 |isbn=978-0-88192-935-5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=803 |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3rVpkZII8IC&pg=RA1-PA803}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Abbott1992>{{cite book |title=Systematic studies of the Helvellaceae in northern and northwestern North America |author=Abbott SP.|year=1992 |publisher=M.Sc.

Common in North America and Europe, it is often an opportunistic [[parasite]], and has a wide range of [[host (biology)|hosts]] among [[deciduous]] trees, although it can also infect [[conifer]]s. It can also live as a [[saprobe]], deriving nutrients from decomposing wood. The mushroom is typically found growing in clusters at the base of trees and stumps. Both the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] are covered in small, pointed scales that are pointed downward and backward. The crowded [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are yellowish, then later rust-brown. The mushroom has an odor that, depending on the author, has been described as resembling garlic, lemon, radish, onion, or skunk. It has a strong taste, resembling radishes.  Once thought to be [[edible mushroom|edible]], it is now considered and known to be [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], especially if consumed in combination with alcohol. The mushroom contains unique chemicals thought to help it infect plants by neutralizing [[hypersensitive response|defensive responses]] employed by them. The very similar ''[[Pholiota squarrosoides|P.&nbsp;squarrosoides]]'' differs in having a paler cap that is sticky between the scales, and smaller [[spore]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first [[species description|described scientifically]] as ''Agaricus squarrosus'' in 1790 by [[George Christian Edler von Oldenburg Oeder]], and later [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] under this name by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in his 1821 ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]''.<ref name=Fries1821/> It was transferred to the genus ''[[Pholiota]]'' by the German [[Paul Kummer]].<ref name=Kummer1871/> It is the [[type species]] of the genus ''Pholiota''.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Pholiota\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''squarrosa'' is derived from [[Latin]], and means \"scurfy\".<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"scaly Pholiota\",<ref name=Ammirati1985/> the \"shaggy scalycap\",<ref name=\"urlRogers\"/> or the \"shaggy Pholiota\".<ref name=Mishra2005/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pholiota squarrosa JPG2.jpg|thumb|left|View of gills and stems]]\nLike other ''Pholiota'' mushrooms, ''P.&nbsp;squarrosa'' has a scaly [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The cap ranges from {{convert|3|to|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and depending on its age, can range in shape from bell-shaped to rounded to somewhat flattened. The cap color is yellowish-brown to [[tawny (color)|tawny]] in older specimens. The scales on the cap are yellowish to tawny, and recurved.<ref name=Overholts1927/><ref name=Overholts1927/><ref name= Healy2008/>\n\nThe stem is {{convert|4|to|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|to|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and roughly equal in width throughout. The partial veil that covers the young gills forms a thick, woolly [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the upper part of the stem. Above the level of the ring, the stem is bare, while below it is scaly like the cap. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are covered by a [[partial veil]] when young and have a greenish-brown color; mature gills are rusty brown. They are crowded closely together, attached to the stem ([[wikt:adnate|adnate]]), and usually notched ([[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]]).<ref name=Overholts1927/><ref name= Healy2008/>\n\nThe [[spore print]] is cinnamon or rusty brown. The [[spore]]s are elliptic, smooth-walled, [[nonamyloid]] (not absorbing [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), and measure 6.6\u20138 by 3.7\u20134.4&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, and four-spored, with dimensions of 16\u201325 by 5\u20137&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>\n\n===Edibility===\nFruit bodies have an odour described variously as resembling garlic,<ref name=Ammirati1985/> radish, lemon, onion, or skunk,<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> and taste like radish.<ref name=Jordan2004/> Although some older sources report ''P.&nbsp;squarrosa'' as [[edible mushroom|edible]], the mushroom has caused several cases of [[poisonous mushroom|poisoning]]. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later.<ref name=Shaffer1965/> The toxic effect may be due to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the [[antabuse]]-effect experienced from ''[[Coprinopsis atramentaria]]'' with alcohol.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Leucopholiota decorosa 24649.jpg|thumb|right|''Leucopholiota decorosa'' is a lookalike.]]\n''Pholiota squarrosa'' is similar in appearance to species in the genus ''[[Armillaria]]'', but the latter produces white spore prints.<ref name=Schwarze2000/> Another similar mushroom is ''[[Pholiota squarrosoides]]'', which can be distinguished microscopically by its smaller spores, and macroscopically by the stickiness of the cap between the scales.<ref name= Healy2008/> ''P.&nbsp;squarrosoides'' also lacks the odor of ''P.&nbsp;squarrosa'', and has flesh that is white, not yellow.<ref name=Murrill1919/> ''[[Leucopholiota decorosa]]'' can also be misidentified with ''P.&nbsp;squarrosa''; it has white, [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] gills with finely scalloped edges, but it can be distinguished most reliably by its white, [[nonamyloid]] spores.<ref name=Miller1996/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\n''Pholiota squarrosa'' is thought to be a [[Spalting#White Rot|white rot]] fungus, which use [[cellulose]] as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the [[lignin]] (present in wood) to [[carbon dioxide]] to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous [[host (biology)|host]] trees, including [[sugar maple]], [[red maple]], [[yellow birch]], [[paper birch]], [[American beech]], and [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]]. It can also attack [[conifer]]s, like [[spruce]]. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi.<ref name=Shigo1970/> It also functions as a [[saprobe]], and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.<ref name=Kuo/>\n\n''P.&nbsp;squarrosa'' is found in North America and Europe.<ref name=Schwarze2000/> The North American distribution extends north to Canada,<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> and south to Mexico, where its appearance is restricted to [[coniferous forests]].<ref name=Guzman1973/> In the Netherlands, ''P.&nbsp;squarrosa'' is one of many mushrooms that can regularly be found fruiting on ancient timber [[wharf|wharves]].<ref name=\"Den Held-Jager1979\"/>\n\nThe fruit bodies are used as a primary food source by the red squirrel ''[[Sciurus vulgaris]]'', and have a higher [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] content than the other mushrooms typically consumed by this species.<ref name=\"Gr\u00f6nwall1984\"/> Decaying fruit bodies are also used as a food source by fruit flies belonging to the genus ''[[Drosophila]]''.<ref name=Kimura1980/>\n\n==Chemistry==\nThe fruit bodies contain unique chemical compounds that are derived from [[phenylpropanoid]]s. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, [[enzyme inhibition|inhibit]] the enzyme [[xanthine oxidase]]. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the [[crystallization]] of [[uric acid]] in the joints, a main cause of [[gouty arthritis]], and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce this side effect. The natural function of these compounds may be to quench [[reactive oxygen species]] produced by plants as a [[hypersensitive response|defensive response]] to fungal infection.<ref

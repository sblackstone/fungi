It is [[parasitic]] on [[oak]] and various other [[hardwood]] species; it is also [[saprobic]], as the [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruit bodies]] develop on dead wood after it has fallen to the ground. Appearing in early spring, its distinctive goblet-shaped and dark-colored fruit bodies have earned it the [[common name]]s '''devil's urn''' and the '''gray urn'''. The distribution of ''U.&nbsp;craterium'' includes eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. It produces [[biological activity|bioactive]] compounds that can inhibit the growth of other fungi. The asexual ([[imperfect fungi|imperfect]]), or [[conidium|conidial]] stage of ''U.&nbsp;craterium'' is a [[plant pathology|plant pathogen]] known as ''Conoplea globosa'', which causes a [[canker]] disease of [[oak]] and several other [[hardwood]] tree species.\n\n==History and taxonomy==\n''Urnula craterium'' was first [[species description|described]] in 1822 by American botanist [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]] as ''Peziza craterium'', based on a specimen found in [[North Carolina]].<ref name=Schweinitz1822/> The species first appeared in the scientific literature under its current name when [[Elias Magnus Fries]] described the new genus ''[[Urnula]]'' in 1849, and set ''Peziza craterium'' as the [[type species]].<ref name=Fries1849/> In 1896, German mycologist [[Heinrich Rehm]] removed the species from ''Urnula'' \u2013 transferring it to the genus ''[[Geopyxis]]'' \u2013 and replaced the type species with ''Urnula terrestris'', a peripherally related species. This restructuring resulted in a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxomically]] untenable situation in which the genus ''Urnula'' consisted of a single species with ambiguous resemblance to the original species (described by Fries) upon which the genus was based. According to Elsie Kupfer, who had written Rehm to clarify the rationale for his decision: <blockquote>''Urnula craterium'' was placed with its related species under ''Geopyxis'', because ''Geopyxis'' was established by Persoon before ''Urnula'' by Fries; and that in order to retain the genus ''Urnula'', under which Saccardo had placed ''Podophacidium terrestre'' of Niessl, he (Rehm) restricted the genus to this latter fungus.<ref name=Kupfer1902/></blockquote>\n\nAs Kupfer explains, Rehm did not justify why he believed ''Urnula craterium'' should be allied to ''Geopyxis'', or why ''Podophacidium terrestre'' should be considered an ''Urnula''. Kupfer's macro- and microscopic analysis of tissues from these and related genera clearly showed the inconsistency in Rehm's taxonomical choices, and that ''Urnula craterium'' represented an entirely different genus not related to ''Geopyxis''; Fries's naming was restored.<ref name=Kupfer1902/>\n\nThe [[genus]] name means \"little [[urn]]\"; the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''[[Krater|cratera]]'', referring to a type of bowl used in antiquity to mix wine with water.<ref name=\"urlLatin Word Lookup\"/> It is [[common name|commonly known]] as the devil's urn<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> and the gray urn.<ref name=Hodgson1996/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruit bodies]] begin from dense, black [[mycelium]] on the surface of [[oak]] branches in contact with the ground. Starting out as rolls of cylindrical tissue 1 or more centimeters long and 3\u20134&nbsp;mm wide, they expand slowly over the winter, and grow rapidly in the spring when the weather becomes warmer.<ref name=Wolf1958/>[[File:Urnula_craterium_xsection.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Finger-shaped piece of dark-colored fungus tissue sliced in half bilaterally, revealing a circular hollow at one end, and solid black tissue on the other end.|A bisected immature specimen with cup not yet opened]]The goblet-shaped fruit body (technically an [[ascocarp]]) is {{convert|3|\u2013|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|4|\u2013|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep; initially it is closed, but opens as it matures, leaving a ragged or smooth [[wikt:inrolled|inrolled]] margin around a round opening.<ref name=Healy2008/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the ascocarp walls is tough and initially gelatinous, later becoming leathery.<ref name=Metzler1992/> The exterior of the ascocarp is brownish black to black, with a velvety surface, while the interior spore-bearing surface, the [[hymenium]], is brownish black in color, usually somewhat paler than the outside. The outer surface may be partially covered with small flakelike patches of tissue.<ref name=Smith1980/> When viewed with a [[magnifying glass]], the \"hairs\" (fungal [[hypha]]e) making up the outer velvety surface are variable in length, and are thick-walled, blunt, and appear to wind from side to side ([[wikt:flexuous|flexuous]]).<ref name=Healy2008/> The ascocarp is connected to a [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] that is typically {{convert|3|\u2013|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.4|\u2013|0.8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick,<ref name=Wolf1958/> with black [[mycelia]] at its base.\n[[File:Urnula_craterium_closeup.jpg|thumb|alt=Three cup-shaped fungi side by side on a piece of wood on the ground. Interior surfaces are black, exterior surfaces brown.|Found in [[Jackson County, Alabama|Jackson Co.]], [[Alabama]], US]]\n\n===Microscopic features===\n\nThe [[ascospore|spores]] are ellipsoid or sausage-shaped ([[wikt:allantoid|allantoid]]), smooth, and thin-walled. They are non-[[amyloid]] (not taking up [[Melzer's reagent|iodine stain]]), and [[hyaline]] (translucent), with dimensions of 22\u201337 by 10\u201315&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=Smith1980/> The spore-bearing cells, the [[ascus|asci]] are eight-spored, cylindrical, and measure 600 by 15\u201317&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Healy2008/> They are [[operculum (botany)|operculate]], analogous to having a flip-top lid mechanism to release the spores. Interspersed among the asci are thin, filamentous, branched [[paraphyses]] that extend beyond the tops of the asci.<ref name=Wolf1958/>\n\nViewed with a [[microscope]], the wall of the apothecium is made of three tissue layers of roughly equal thickness. The first layer of tissue is black, leathery and compact, and covered with a fine layer of brownish-black hairs (a tomentum); the second layer consists of loosely interlaced brown [[hypha]]e suspended in a gelatinous matrix. The third layer is the fertile, spore-bearing surface, the brownish-black [[hymenium]].<ref name=Wolf1958/>\n\n===Imperfect state===\nThe [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of ''Urnula craterium'' allows for both an [[imperfect fungi|imperfect]] (making asexual spores, or [[conidium|conidia]]) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often happened in fungal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], the imperfect form was given a different name, because the relationship between the perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known. The imperfect stage of ''Urnula craterium'' is the [[plant pathogen]]ic species ''Conoplea globosa'', known to cause a [[canker]] disease (Strumella canker) of [[oak]] and several other [[hardwood]]s.<ref name=Hughes1951/><ref name=Pirone2000/>\n\n===Edibility===\n\nThis species is often listed in [[field guide]]s as inedible,<ref name=Miller2006/><ref name=McKnight1987/> or not recommended for consumption due to its tough texture.<ref name=Smith1980/> Michael Kuo, in his 2007 book on edible mushrooms, lists the taste as \"mediocre\", and comments \"the devil's urn is not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's not ''good'', mind you, but it would be possible to eat it with a forced smile if your Aunt Wanda served it to you.\"<ref name=Kuo2007/>\nI have eaten twice, it doesn't taste any special... To be frank not that dissimilar from Sarcoscypha coccinea.\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Plectania melastoma 62452.jpg|thumb|right|''Plectania melastoma'' is a lookalike species.]]\nThe cup fungus ''[[Plectania melastoma]]'' is also black, but it is smaller and the cup not as deep.<ref name=Arora1991/>\n\n==Spore development==\nThe [[ascospore|spores]] of ''U.&nbsp;craterium'' have a rapid and high percentage of [[germinate|germination]]. Germination requires only 1.5&nbsp;hours, a relatively short time compared to another inoperculate species in the same [[family (biology)|family]], ''[[Sarcoscypha coccinea]]'', which requires 48&nbsp;hours.<ref name=Fergus1960/> Furthermore, germination is possible under a wide temperature range, from {{convert|5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, and wide soil [[pH]] range; the quality and quantity of light does not affect germination, although prolonged exposure to light does reduce germination efficiency.<ref name=Fergus1960/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\n''Urnula craterium'' grows singly or clustered together, usually attached to sticks and branches (especially [[oak]]) that are partially buried in the ground.<ref name=Wolf1958/> The [[teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]] state is [[saprobic]], and decomposes hardwood;<ref name=Kuo2007/> the anamorph state is [[parasitism|parasitic]], and causes a [[canker]] of various [[hardwood]]s, including oaks, [[hickory (botany)|hickories]], [[basswood]] and [[beech]].<ref name=Hodgson1996/> It is often found in [[deciduous]] forests, although it is sometimes inconspicuous due to its dark color, and because it may be partially covered with leaf litter. One of the first fleshy fungi to appear from March to May, ''U.&nbsp;craterium'' has been dubbed a \"harbinger of spring\",<ref name=McKnight1987/><ref name=\"urlFotM\"/> and is sometimes encountered under melting snow.<ref name=McKnight1987/>\n\nThe distribution of ''U.&nbsp;craterium'' includes eastern North America,<ref name=Hodgson1996/> Europe (including the Czech Republic,<ref name=Marounek2007/> Finland,<ref name=Lindholm1983/> Spain,<ref name=Calonge2003/>) Japan,<ref name=Otani1980/> and China.<ref name=Zhuang1998/> It is [[Regional Red List|red-listed]] as [[critically endangered species|critically endangered]] in the [[Czech Republic]].<ref name=Marounek2007/>\n\n==Bioactive compounds==\n\n''Urnula craterium'', when grown in [[liquid culture]], produces [[bioactivity|bioactive]] chemicals that inhibit the growth of other fungi that are [[plant pathogen|pathogenic]] to [[aspen]]; specifically, these chemical are antagonistic to aspen blue-stain fungi ''[[Ophiostoma crassivaginatum]]'' and ''O. piliferum'', as well as the [[wood-decay fungus]] ''[[Phellinus tremulae]]''.<ref name=Ayer1995/> Chemicals produced by ''U.&nbsp;craterium'' include pestalotin, 5,6-dehydropestalotin, 4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-pyran-2-one, and (4''S'')-3,4-dihydro-4,8-dihydroxy-1(2H)-napthalenone. However, none of these isolated compounds inhibits the aspen pathogens ''[[in vitro]]'', suggesting the true nature of the antifungal mechanism in the devil's urn has not yet been resolved.<ref name=Ayer2000/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1991>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |authorlink=David Arora |title=All that the Rain Promises and More: A Hip Pocket Guide to Western Mushrooms |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1991 |page=830 |isbn=978-0-89815-388-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ayer1995>{{cite journal |author=Ayer WA. |year=1995 |title=Application of natural products chemistry to a biological problem |journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=465\u2013470 |doi=10.1139/v95-061}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ayer2000>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ayer WA, Trifonov LS, Hutchison LJ, Chakravarty P |year=2000 |title=Metabolites from a wood-inhabiting cup fungus, ''Urnula craterium'' |journal=Natural Product Research |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=405\u2013410 |doi=10.1080/10575630008043776}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Calonge2003>{{cite journal |title=Some interesting fungi found in Spain, with special reference to the province of Valladolid |journal=Micologia Italiana |vauthors=Calonge FD, Garcia A, Sanz M, Bastardo J |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=42\u201352 |issn=0390-0460}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Fergus1960>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fergus CL, Schein RD |year=1960 |title=Effect of environment on germination of ascospores of ''Urnula craterium'' |journal=Mycologia |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=719\u2013725 |doi=10.2307/3755871 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0052/005/0719.htm|jstor=3755871 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Fries1849>{{cite book |author=Fries EM. |year=1849 |title=Summa vegetabilium Scandinaviae |volume=2 |publisher=A.&nbsp;Bonnier |location=Stockholm & Leipzig |page=364 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/32636985 |language=Latin}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Healy2008>{{cite book |vauthors=Healy RA, Huffman DR, Tiffany LH, Knaphaus G |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of the Midcontinental United States (Bur Oak Guide) |publisher=University of Iowa Press |location=Iowa City |year=2008 |page=295 |isbn=978-1-58729-627-7}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hodgson1996>{{cite book |author=Hodgson M. |title=No Shit!

It is generally [[saprophytic]], but occasionally also attacks living wood. It belongs to section ''Levipedes'' of the genus, being characterized by a smooth [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] having no hairs at the base (in contrast to section ''Vestipedes'').<ref>See \"''Levipedes''\" page of [http://www.nybg.org/bsci/res/col/index.html \"A revision of Collybia s.l. in the northeastern United States & adjacent Canada\"], Roy Halling.</ref><ref>Meinhard Moser, translated by Simon Plant: ''Keys to Agarics and Boleti'' (Roger Phillips 1983)  {{ISBN|0-9508486-0-3}}</ref>  Until recently it was most frequently known as '''''Collybia dryophila'''''.\n\n== Description ==\n<ref name=\"Courtecuisse\">Courtecuisse, R. & Duhem, B.

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]], which are only thinly attached to the stem, are whitish and crowded, and the [[spore print|spore powder]] is white.  The bald [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|8|cm|in}} long by 4&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n\nMicroscopically the spores are 6\u00d73&nbsp;\u00b5m in size and slightly tear-shaped, there are lobed club-shaped[[cystidium|cystidia]] (15-50&nbsp;\u00b5m \u00d7 2-6&nbsp;\u00b5m), and the [[hypha]]e on the cap [[cuticle]] can also have lobes.\nIt is contended that ''G. dryophilus'' in fact consists of a [[species complex|complex]] of different species and that several new species (including ''G. brunneolus'', ''G. earleae'' and ''G. subsulphureus'') should be split off from it.<ref name=Kuo/>  However these species are not generally recognized at present.<ref>[http://www.indexfungorum.org/Index.htm Index Fungorum]</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThis fungus is very common in northern hemisphere temperate woodlands (so much so that it is sometimes considered a \"weed\" mushroom<ref name=Kuo>Kuo, M.

Although the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[specific name (botany)|epithet]] ''dryophilus'' means \"lover of oak trees\", it is also found with other broad-leaved trees and with [[conifer]]s.\n\n==Edibility==\n''Gymnopus dryophilus'' is generally considered to be [[edible mushroom|edible]], though not worthwhile.<ref name=\"Bon\"/><ref name=\"Phillips\"/> It is recommended not to eat the stem, which is tough.\n\nIt has been found to contain [[anti-inflammatory]] [[beta-glucans]]<ref>Pacheco-Sanchez M, Boutin Y, Angers P, Gosselin A, Tweddell RJ.

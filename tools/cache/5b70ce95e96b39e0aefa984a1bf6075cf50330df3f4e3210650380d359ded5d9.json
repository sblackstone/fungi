In North America, it is found in northeast, central and southeastern Mexico. In South America, it has been recorded from Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador. It is also known from the Caribbean island [[Martinique]], and China. The mushroom grows in clusters or groups on rotting wood. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have conical to bell-shaped reddish- to orangish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, set atop slender [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The mushrooms stain blue when bruised, indicative of the presence of the compound [[psilocybin]]. ''Psilocybe yungensis'' is used by [[Mazatec people|Mazatec Indians]] in the Mexican State of [[Oaxaca]] for [[entheogen]]ic purposes.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\nThe species was described as new to science by American mycologists [[Rolf Singer]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]], based on specimens collected in [[Nor Yungas Province]], [[Bolivia]], on the road to [[La Paz]] to [[Coroico]].<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/> They published a short description in [[Latin]] in a 1958 ''[[Mycologia]]'' publication,<ref name=Singer1958/> followed by a more detailed description in English later that year.<ref name=Singer1958b/> According to ''[[Psilocybe]]'' specialist [[Gast\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n]], the species ''Psilocybe acutissima'' (described by [[Roger Heim]] in 1958<ref name=Heim1958/>), and ''Psilocybe isauri'' (described by Singer in 1959<ref name=Singer1959/>) are [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]], as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the [[type (biology)|type]] material of all three.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Singer considered ''P.&nbsp;isauri'' a species distinct from ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' because of differences in the hairiness of the stem surface. Smith named the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' var. ''diconica'' for specimens he found with conical, rather than obconical (the form of an inverted cone) [[umbo (mycology)|papilla]]. Similarly, the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to ''P.&nbsp;acutissima'' was a [[papillate]] cap (somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast). Later studies showed that these [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] variations did not warrant individual recognition, because of the variable nature of these characteristics, and the existence of intermediate forms.<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/>\n\nGuzm\u00e1n places ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Cordisporae'', a grouping of ''Psilocybe'' species characterized primarily by having [[rhomboid]] spores less than 8&nbsp;[[micrometer]]s long.<ref>Guzm\u00e1n (1983), p. 106.</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''yungensis'' refers to the name of the [[type locality (biology)|type locality]].<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/> The natives of [[Huautla de Jim\u00e9nez]] and [[Mixe]] natives call ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' a ''hongo adivinador'' (\"divinatory mushroom\"), ''hong que adormece'' (\"soporific mushroom\"), or ''hongo genio'' (\"genius mushroom\").<ref name=Stamets1996/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Psilocybe yungensis 163986.jpg|thumb|left|Caps range in shape from conical to bell-shaped, and have a prominent umbo. Stems are densely covered with whitish fibrils pressed flat against the surface.]]\nThe ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are conical to bell-shaped in maturity, and reach a diameter of up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The cap surface is smooth and sticky, and, in moist specimens, has faint radial striations (grooves) that extend almost to the margin. The color of fresh caps ranges from dark reddish-brown to rusty brown to orangish-brown. Additionally, the cap is [[hygrophanous]], meaning it will change color depending on its state of hydration; a dry cap fades to become dull yellowish-brown or the color of \"dingy straw\". The cap frequently has a prominent [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]].<ref name=Stamets1996/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] attachment ranges from adnate (broadly attached to the stem) to adnexed (narrowly attached). The spacing of the narrow gills is close to crowded, and the gill color is initially dull gray before maturing spores cause the color to change to purplish-brown. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|to|2.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, and more or less equal in width throughout its length or slightly larger near the base. The hollow, brittle, stem is pale brown on the upper part, and reddish-brown near the bottom. The stem is densely covered with whitish fibrils that are pressed flat against the surface; the fibrils slough off in maturity to leave a smooth surface.<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/> The mushroom has a cortinate [[partial veil]] (resembling the webby cortina produced by species of ''[[Cortinarius]]'') but it does not last for long; it occasionally leaves behind sparse remnants of tissue hanging on the cap margin and the upper part of the stem. No [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] remains on the stem after the veil disappears. All parts of the mushroom will stain blue when injured; these stains will blacken as the mushroom dries.<ref name=Stamets1996/>\n{{multiple image | align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header =\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Psilocybe yungensis 171324.jpg\n| caption1 = Spores and translucent cheilocystidia\n| image2 = Psilocybe yungensis 171250.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Cap cuticle]], cap tissue, and gill tissue at 100x magnification\n}}\nThe [[spore print]] is dark purplish-brown. [[Spore]]s range in shape from roughly [[rhombus|rhomboid]] to roughly elliptical, and typically have dimensions of 5\u20136 by 4\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=Stamets1996/> They are thick-walled and have a large [[germ pore]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped to swollen, hyaline, usually four-spored (although rarely two- or three-spored forms are present), and measure 13\u201319 by 4.4\u20136.6&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\">Guzm\u00e1n (1983), pp. 150\u20132.</ref> The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are ventricose (swollen) near the base and often mucronate (ending abruptly in a short sharp point) at the apex, and measure 14\u201325 by 4.4\u201310.5&nbsp;\u03bcm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are variable in shape, and measure 14\u201340 by 4.4\u20137.7&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Stamets1996/> Pleurocystidia are relatively sparse, while cheilocystidia are abundant. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the [[hypha]]e. The application of a drop of [[potassium hydroxide]] solution turns both the cap and the stem from brown to blackish.<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nThe species ''[[Psilocybe subyungensis]]'', known only from [[Venezuela]], is roughly similar in form, although somewhat smaller, with a cap width of up to {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and stem lengths of up to {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. In addition to differences in distribution, it can be clearly distinguished from ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' by the larger cystidia: the pleurocystidia measure 8.8\u201311 by 3.8\u20135.5&nbsp;\u03bcm, and the cheilocystidia 16.5\u201325 by 7.7\u201312&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Guzman1978/> Stamets notes that \"Few species resemble ''P.&nbsp;yungensis''\", while Michael Beug considers the orangish-brown cap color unusual for a ''Psilocybe'', and compares it to ''[[Conocybe]]''.<ref name=Beug2011/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Psilocybe yungensis'' is a [[saprobic]] species, and contributes to the degradation of organic matter deposited in soils and [[nutrient cycling]] in forests where it grows.<ref>Guzm\u00e1n (1983), p. 22.</ref> It typically grows in clusters or groups on rotting wood (rarely on [[humus]]); it is less frequently found growing solitarily. It is often reported from coffee plantations, [[tropical moist forests|subtropical]], or [[cloud forest]]s, especially those occurring at elevations between {{convert|1000|and|2000|m|abbr=on}}. The species occurs in northeast, central and southeastern Mexico, and has been recorded from several locations in the states of [[Oaxaca]], [[Puebla]], [[Tamaulipas]] and [[Veracruz]].<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/><ref name=Guzman1988/> It is also known from [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], and [[Ecuador]],<ref name=Stamets1996/> as well as the Caribbean island [[Martinique]].<ref name=Guzman2000/> In 2009, it was reported from China.<ref name=Bau2009/> In Mexico and Colombia, the fungus usually fruits between June and July; in Bolivia, it was recorded appearing during January.<ref name=\"Guzman1983pp.150-2\"/>\n\n==Uses==\nThe fruit bodies of ''Psilocybe yungensis'' are used for [[entheogen]]ic, or spiritual, ritualistic purposes by the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec Indians]] in the Mexican State of [[Oaxaca]].<ref name=Guzman2008/> Some authorities have suggested that ''P.&nbsp;yungensis'' is the \"tree fungus\" reported by [[Jesuit missionaries]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, a reddish mushroom that was apparently the source of an intoxicating beverage used by the [[Yurimagua]] Indians of [[Peruvian Amazon|Amazonian Peru]]. There is, however, no established record of hallucinogenic mushroom use in that area,<ref name=Schultes1966/><ref name=Schultes1969/> and it is possible that the mushroom could instead be a psychedelic species of the wood-dwelling genus ''[[Gymnopilus]]''.<ref name=Gartz1996/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[Legal status of psilocybin mushrooms]]\n*[[List of Psilocybin mushrooms]]\n*[[List of Psilocybe species|List of ''Psilocybe'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Bau2009>{{cite journal |author=Bau T. |title=Strophariaceae of China.

The species is a common and ecologically important [[wood-decay fungus]] that can live as a [[saprobe]], or as an opportunistic [[parasitism|parasite]] in weakened tree hosts to cause [[root rot|root]] or [[butt rot]]. It is found in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The species forms [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood. The fungus has been inadvertently [[introduced species|introduced]] to South Africa. ''Armillaria gallica'' has had a confusing [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], due in part to historical difficulties encountered in distinguishing between similar ''Armillaria'' species. The fungus received international attention in the early 1990s when an individual [[colony (biology)|colony]] living in a [[Michigan]] forest was reported to cover an area of {{convert|15|ha}}, weigh at least {{convert|9500|kg|lb|sigfig=2}}, and be 1,500 years old. This individual is popularly known as the \"humungous fungus\", and is a tourist attraction and inspiration for an annual mushroom-themed festival in [[Crystal Falls, Michigan|Crystal Falls]]. Recent studies have revised the fungus's age to 2,500 years and its size to about 440 tons, four times the original estimate.<ref name=\"si\">{{cite web |last1=Daley |first1=Jason |title=This Humongous Fungus Is as Massive as Three Blue Whales |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mushroom-massive-three-blue-whales-180970549/ |website=Smithsonian.com |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=21 October 2018 |date=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Armillaria gallica'' is a largely subterranean fungus, and it produces fruit bodies that are up to about {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, yellow-brown, and covered with small scales. On the underside of the [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] are [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that are white to creamy or pale orange. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] may be up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a white cobwebby [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] that divides the color of the stem into pale orange to brown above, and lighter-colored below. The fungus can develop an extensive system of underground root-like structures, called [[rhizomorphs]], that help it to efficiently decompose dead wood in [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]]. It has been the subject of considerable scientific research due to its importance as a [[plant pathogen]], its ability to [[bioluminescence|bioluminesce]], its unusual [[biological life cycle|life cycle]], and its ability to form large and long-lived [[clonal colony|colonies]].\n\n==Phylogeny, taxonomy and naming==\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n|clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n|label1=\n|1={{clade\n    |1={{clade\n           |1={{clade\n               |{{clade\n                  |1={{clade\n                       |1=''[[Armillaria solidipes|A. solidipes]]''\n                       |2=''[[Armillaria gemina|A. gemina]]''\n                       }}\n                  |2={{clade\n                       |1={{clade\n                           |1={{clade\n                               |1=''[[Armillaria calvescens|A. calvescens]]''\n                               |2={{clade\n                                    |1='''''A. gallica''''' (ST22)\n                                    |2='''''A. gallica''''' (ST23)\n                                    }}\n                               }}\n                           |2='''''A. gallica''''' (M70)\n                           }}\n                       |2={{clade\n                           |1=''[[Armillaria sinapina|A. sinapina]]''\n                           |2=''[[Armillaria cepistipes|A. cepistipes]]''\n                           }}\n                       |3=NABS X\n                       |4=''[[Armillaria nabsnona|A. nabsnona]]''\n                       }}\n                  }}\n           |2=''[[Armillaria tabescens|A. tabescens]]''\n           |3=''[[Armillaria mellea|A. mellea]]''\n}}}}}}}}\n|caption=Phylogeny and relationships of ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' and related North American species based on [[amplified fragment length polymorphism]] data.

In 1987 Romagnesi and Marxm\u00fcller renamed EBS&nbsp;E to ''Armillaria gallica''.<ref name=Marxmuller1987/> Another [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]], ''A.&nbsp;lutea'', had originally been described by [[Claude Casimir Gillet]] in 1874,<ref name=Gillet1874/> and proposed as a name for EBS&nbsp;E.<ref name=Watling1987/><ref name=Termorshuizen1987/> Although the name had [[Principle of Priority|priority]] due to its early publication date, it was rejected as a ''[[nomen ambiguum]]'' because of a lack of supporting evidence to identify the fungus, including a specimen, [[type locality (biology)|type locality]], and incomplete collection notes.<ref name=Marxmuller1992/> ''A.&nbsp;inflata'' (Velenovsk\u00fd, 1920) may represent another synonym, but the type specimens were not preserved, so it is considered a dubious name (''[[nomen dubium]]'').<ref name=Antonin1990/> As of 2010, both the [[Index Fungorum]] and [[MycoBank]] consider ''Armillaria gallica'' Marxm. & Romagn. to be the current name, with ''A.&nbsp;bulbosa'' and ''A.&nbsp;lutea'' as synonyms.<ref name=\"urlSpecies Fungorum - Species synonymy\"/><ref name=\"urlMycoBank, the fungal website\"/>\n\n[[Phylogenetic]] analysis of North American ''Armillaria'' species based on analysis of [[amplified fragment length polymorphism]] data suggests that ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' is most closely related to ''A.&nbsp;sinapina'', ''A. cepistipes'', and ''A. calvescens''.<ref name=Kim2006/> These results are similar to those reported in 1992 that compared sequences of nuclear [[ribosomal DNA]].<ref name=Anderson1992/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''gallica'' is botanical [[Latin]] for \"French\" (from ''Gallia'', \"Gaul\"),<ref name=\"OEDlatin\"/> and refers to the [[Type locality (biology)#type locality|type locality]].<ref name=Stearn/> The prior name ''bulbosa'' is Latin for \"bulb-bearing, bulbous\" (from ''bulbus'' and the suffix -''osa'').<ref name=\"OEDlatin\"/><ref name=Stearn/> ''Armillaria'' is derived from the Latin ''armilla'', or \"bracelet\".<ref name=Stager1999/>\n\n==Description==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Armillaria gallica 57634.jpg|image2=Armillaria gallica 25558.jpg|width=200|caption1=Young fruit bodies have a cottony partial veil that protects the developing gills.|caption2=Mature gills|alt1=The underside of a mushroom cap showing whitish cottony tissue connecting the edge of the brown cap with the whitish stem.|alt2=The underside of a mushroom cap showing numerous closely spaced gills. A small ring of whitish cottony tissue can be seen at the stem where it attaches the cap.}}\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''Armillaria gallica'' have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are {{convert|2.5|\u2013|9.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad, and depending on their age, may range in shape from conical to convex to flattened. The caps are brownish-yellow to brown when moist, often with a darker-colored center; the color tends to fade upon drying. The cap surface is covered with slender fibers (same color as the cap) that are erect, or sloping upwards.\n\nWhen the fruit bodies are young, the underside of the caps have a cottony layer of tissue stretching from the edge of the cap to the stem\u2014a [[partial veil]]\u2014which serves to protect the developing [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. As the cap grows in size the membrane is eventually pulled away from the cap to expose the gills. The gills have an adnate (squarely attached) to somewhat decurrent (extending down the length of the stem) attachment to the stem. They are initially white, but age to a creamy or pale orange covered with rust-colored spots. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4|\u2013|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.6|\u2013|1.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and almost club-shaped with the base up to {{convert|1.3|\u2013|2.7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Above the level of the [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], the stem is pale orange to brown, while below it is whitish or pale pink, becoming grayish-brown at the base. The ring is positioned about {{convert|0.4|\u2013|0.9|cm|in|abbr=on}} below the level of the cap, and may be covered with yellowish to pale-brownish woolly cottony [[mycelium|mycelia]]. The base of the stem is attached to [[rhizomorph]]s, black root-like structures 1\u20133&nbsp;mm in diameter. While the primary function of the below-ground mycelia is to absorb nutrients from the soil, the rhizomorphs serve a more exploratory function, to locate new food bases.<ref name=Fox2000/><ref name=Mihail1995/>\n\n===Microscopic features===\nWhen the spores are seen in deposit, such as with a [[spore print]], they appear whitish. They have an [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] or [[wikt:oblong|oblong]] shape, usually contain an oil droplet, and have dimensions of 7\u20138.5 by 5\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidium|basidia]], are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 32\u201343 by 7\u20138.7&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Bas1995/> Other cells present in the fertile [[hymenium]] include the cheilocystidia ([[cystidium|cystidia]] present on the edge of a gill), which are club-shaped, roughly cylindrical and 15\u201325 by 5.0\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m. Cystidia are also present on the stem (called caulocystidia), and are broadly club-shaped, measuring 20\u201355 by 11\u201323&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Antonin2009/> The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of [[hypha]]e that are irregularly interwoven and project upward to form the scales seen on the surface. The hyphae that make up the surface scales typically measure 26\u201388&nbsp;\u00b5m long by 11\u201327&nbsp;\u00b5m thick and can be covered with a crust of [[pigment]]. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of most tissues.<ref name=Bas1995/>\n\n===Edibility===\nLike all ''Armillaria'' species, ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' is considered [[edible mushrooms|edible]]. Thorough cooking is usually recommended, as the raw mushroom tastes [[wikt:acrid|acrid]] when fresh or undercooked.<ref name=Fox2000/> One author advises to consume only a small portion initially, as some people may experience an upset stomach.<ref name=Rogers/> The taste is described as \"mild to bitter\", and the odor \"sweet\",<ref name=\"urlArmillaria gallica (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/> or reminiscent of [[camembert]] cheese.<ref name=Antonin2009/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Armillaria calvescens]]'' is rather similar in appearance, and can only be reliably distinguished from ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' by observing microscopic characteristics. ''A.&nbsp;calvescens'' has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name=\"urlArmillaria gallica (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/> ''[[Armillaria mellea|A.&nbsp;mellea]]'' has a thinner stem than ''A.&nbsp;gallica'', but can be more definitively distinguished by the absence of clamps at the base of the basidia.<ref name=\"urlarmillaria mellea gallica\"/> Similarly, ''A.&nbsp;cepistipes'' and ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. [[Molecular biology|Molecular]] methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing [[DNA sequence]]s in the [[gene]] coding [[Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1|translation elongation factor 1-alpha]].<ref name=Antonin2009/>\n\n===Metabolites===\n''Armillaria gallica'' can produce [[cyclobutane]]-containing [[metabolite]]s such as arnamiol,<ref name=Gribble2009/> a [[natural product]] that is classified as a [[terpenoid|sesquiterpenoid]] [[aryl]] [[ester]].<ref name=Dervilla1986/> Although the specific function of arnamiol is not definitively known, similar chemicals present in other ''Armillaria'' species are thought to play a role in inhibiting the growth of antagonistic bacteria or fungi, or in killing cells of the host plant prior to infection.<ref name=Peipp1992/>\n\n===Bioluminescence===\nThe [[mycelia]] (but not the [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]]) of ''Armillaria gallica'' are known to be [[bioluminescent]]. Experiments have shown that the intensity of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when they are exposed to fluorescent light.<ref name=Mihail2007/> Bioluminescence is caused by the action of [[luciferase]]s, enzymes that produce light by the [[oxidation]] of a [[luciferin]] (a [[pigment]]).<ref name=Shimomura2010/> The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal,<ref name=Sivinski1981/> it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions,<ref name=Buller1924/> or it may help deter [[heterotroph]]s that might consume the fungus.<ref name=Sivinski1981/>\n\n==Humongous fungus==\n[[File:Armillaria gallica 27834.jpg|thumb|260px|right|The fruit bodies\u2014the visible manifestation of ''A.&nbsp;gallica''\u2014belie an extensive underground network of mycelia.|alt=Two clusters of mushrooms growing in a bed of green moss.

In one particular forest stand, ''Armillaria''-infected [[oak]] trees had been harvested, and their stumps were left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus, identified as ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' (then known as ''A.&nbsp;bulbosa''). Using [[molecular genetics]], they determined that the underground [[mycelium|mycelia]] of one individual fungal [[colony (biology)|colony]] covered {{convert|15|ha|abbr=on}}, weighing over {{convert|9500|kg|lb|sigfig=2}}, with an estimated age of 1,500 years.<ref name=Stamets2000/><ref name=Volk2002/> The analysis used [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) and [[RAPD|random amplification of polymorphic DNA]] (RAPD) to examine [[genetic isolate|isolates]] collected from fruit bodies and [[rhizomorph]]s (underground aggregations of fungal cells that resemble plant roots) along {{convert|1|km|mi|1|sp=us|adj=on}} [[transect]]s in the forest. The 15-hectare area yielded isolates that had identical [[mating type]] alleles and [[mitochondrial DNA]] [[restriction fragment]] patterns; this degree of genetic similarity indicated that the samples were all derived from a single genetic individual, or [[clone (cell biology)|clone]], that had reached its size through [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative growth]]. In their conclusion, the authors noted: \"This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth.\"<ref name=Smith1992/> After the ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' paper was published, major media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found; as a result of this publicity, the individual acquired the [[common name]] \"humongous fungus\".<ref name=Volk2002/> There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other [[largest organism|large organisms]] such as the [[blue whale]] or the [[giant redwood]].<ref name=Wilson1999/>\n\nThe fungus has since become a popular tourist attraction in Michigan, and has inspired a \"Humongous Fungus Fest\" held annually in August in [[Crystal Falls, Michigan|Crystal Falls]].<ref name=Sceurman2010/> The organism was the subject of a [[Late Show Top Ten List]] on [[Late Night with David Letterman]],<ref name=Sieger2004/> and an advertising campaign by the rental company [[U-Haul]].<ref name=Volk2002/>\n\n==Life cycle and growth==\nThe [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' includes two [[diploid]]ization\u2013[[haploid]]ization events. The first of these is the usual process of [[karyogamy|cell fusion]] (forming a diploid) followed by [[meiosis]] during the formation of haploid [[basidiospore]]s.<ref name=Peabody1985/> The second event is more cryptic and occurs before fruit body formation. In most [[Basidiomycetes|basidiomycetous]] fungi, the hyphae of compatible [[mating type]]s will fuse to form a two-[[cell nucleus|nucleate]], or [[dikaryotic]] stage; this stage is not observed in ''Armillaria'' species, which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and diploid. Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra haploidization event prior to fruit body formation to create a [[genetic mosaic]].<ref name=Peabody2000/> These regular and repeating haploidization events result in increased [[genetic diversity]], which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, such as drought.<ref name=Peabody2003/><ref name=Peabody2005/><ref name=Gatto2009/>\n\nThe growth rate of ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' rhizomorphs is between {{convert|0.3|and|0.6|m|ft|abbr=on|1}} per year.<ref name=Rishbeth1991/> [[Population genetics|Population genetic]] studies of the fungus conducted in the 1990s demonstrated that genetic individuals grow [[mitosis|mitotically]] from a single point of origin to eventually occupy territories that may include many adjacent root systems over large areas (several [[hectare]]s) of forest floor.<ref name=Smith1992/><ref name=Rizzo1995/><ref name=Saville1996/> Based on the low [[mutation rate]]s observed in large, long-lived individuals, ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' appears to have an especially stable [[genome]].<ref name=Hodnett2000/> It has also been hypothesized that genetic stability may result from self-renewing mycelial repositories of nuclei with [[stem cell]]-like properties.<ref name=Gladfelter2009/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[File:Armillaria gallica 57632.jpg|thumb|left|Young fruit bodies growing in clusters at the base of a tree|alt=Several clusters of light brown mushrooms growing in moss on the base of a large tree.]]\n''Armillaria gallica'' can normally be found on the ground, but sometimes on stumps and logs.<ref name=Roody2003/> Mushrooms that appear to be terrestrial are attached to plant roots underneath the surface.<ref name=\"urlArmillaria gallica (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/> It is widely distributed and has been collected in North America, Europe,<ref name=Rogers/> and Asia (China,<ref name=Qin2007/> Iran,<ref name=Asef2003/> and Japan<ref name=Ota2009/>).

Some of the terminal branches have a small circular cell at their tips.]]\n''Armillaria gallica'' is a weaker [[plant pathogen|pathogen]] than the related ''A.&nbsp;mellea'' or ''[[Armillaria solidipes|A.&nbsp;solidipes]]'', and is considered a secondary parasite\u2014typically initiating infection only after the host's defenses have been weakened by insect defoliation, drought, or infection by another fungus.<ref name=Marcais2006/> Fungal infection can lead to [[root rot]] or [[butt rot]].<ref name=Healy2008/> As the diseased trees die, the wood dries, increasing the chance of catching fire after being struck by lightning. The resulting forest fire may, in turn, kill the species that killed the trees.<ref name=Stamets2005/> Plants that are under [[water stress]] caused by dry soils or [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] are more susceptible to infection by ''A.&nbsp;gallica''.<ref name=Packham2007/> It has been shown to be one of several ''Armillaria'' species responsible for widespread mortality of [[oak]] trees in the Arkansas [[Ozark]]s.<ref name=Kelly2009/> The fungus has also been shown to infect [[Daylily]] in [[South Carolina]],<ref name=Schnabel2005/> [[Northern highbush blueberry]] (''Vaccinium corymbosum'') in Italy<ref name=Prodorutti2006/><ref name=Prodorutti2009/> and vineyards (''[[Vitis]]'' species) of [[R\u00edas Baixas (DO)|R\u00edas Baixas]] in northwestern Spain. The latter infestation \"may be related to the fact that the vineyards from which they were isolated were located on cleared forestry sites\".<ref name=AguinCasal2003/> When ''A.&nbsp;solidipes'' and ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' co-occur in the same forest, infection of root systems by ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' may reduce damage or prevent infection from ''A.&nbsp;solidipes''.<ref name=\"urlCFS:Armillaria gallica\"/>\n[[File:Armillaria gallica 57535.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''A.&nbsp;gallica'' may be parasitized by the fungus ''Entoloma abortivum'', resulting in grayish-white, malformed fruit bodies.|alt=Six mushrooms of various shape and either brown or whitish in color, picked and laid in a row on a bed of moss. The two brown mushrooms have stems and caps. The smallest mushroom also has stem and cap, but is whitish-gray. Three other whitish-gray mushrooms are irregularly shaped and lumpy.]]\n\n''Armillaria gallica'' can develop an extensive subterranean system of rhizomorphs, which helps it to compete with other fungi for resources or to attack trees weakened by other fungi. A field study in an ancient broadleaved woodland in England showed that of five ''Armillaria'' species present in the woods, ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' was consistently the first to colonize tree stumps that had been [[coppicing|coppiced]] the previous year.<ref name=Rishbeth1991/> [[Fractal geometry]] has been used to model the branching patterns of the hyphae of various ''Armillaria'' species. Compared to a strongly pathogenic species like ''A.&nbsp;solidipes'', ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' has a relatively sparse branching pattern that is thought to be \"consistent with a foraging strategy in which acceptable food bases may be encountered at any distance, and which favours broad and divisive distribution of potential inoculum.\"<ref name=Mihail1995/> Because the rhizomorphs form regular [[network theory|networks]], mathematical concepts of [[graph theory]] have been employed to describe fungal growth and interpret ecological strategies, suggesting that the specific patterns of network attachments allow the fungus \"to respond opportunistically to spatially and temporally changing environments\".<ref name=Lamour2007/>\n\n''Armillaria gallica'' may itself be parasitized by other [[soil life|soil flora]]. Several species of the fungus ''[[Trichoderma]]'', including ''[[Trichoderma polysporum]]'', ''[[Trichoderma harzianum|T.&nbsp;harzianum]]'' and ''[[Trichoderma viride|T.&nbsp;viride]]'', are able to attack and penetrate the outer tissue of ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae about one week after the initial infection.<ref name=Dumas1992/> ''[[Entoloma abortivum]]'' is another fungus that can live parasitically upon ''A.&nbsp;gallica''. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the ''E.&nbsp;abortivum'' hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development.<ref name=Czederpiltz2001/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Armillaria species|List of ''Armillaria'' species]]\n* [[List of bioluminescent fungi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=AguinCasal2003>{{cite journal |vauthors=Agu\u00edn-Casal O, S\u00e1inz-Os\u00e9s MJ, Mansilla-V\u00e1zquez JP |year=2003 |title=''Armillaria'' species infesting vineyards in northwestern Spain |journal=European Journal of Plant Pathology |volume=110 |issue=7 |pages=683\u201387 |doi=10.1023/B:EJPP.0000041553.98879.51 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ammirati2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati J, Trudell S |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest: Timber Press Field Guide (Timber Press Field Guides) |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2009 |page=109 |isbn=978-0-88192-935-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC&pg=PA109}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Anderson1979>{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson JB, Ullrich RC |year=1979 |title=Biological species of ''Armillaria'' in North America |journal=Mycologia |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=401\u201314 |jstor=3759160 |doi=10.2307/3759160 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Anderson1980>{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson JB, Korhonen K, Ullrich RC |year=1980 |title=Relationships between European and North American biological species of ''Armillaria mellea'' |journal=Experimental Mycology |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=78\u201386 |doi=10.1016/0147-5975(80)90053-5 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Anderson1992>{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson JB, Stasovski E |year=1992 |title=Molecular phylogeny of northern hemisphere species of ''Armillaria'' |journal=Mycologia |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=505\u201316 |jstor=3760315 |doi=10.2307/3760315 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Antonin1990>{{cite journal |author=Anton\u00edn V. |year=1990 |title=Studies in annulate species of the genus ''Armillaria''\u2013III.

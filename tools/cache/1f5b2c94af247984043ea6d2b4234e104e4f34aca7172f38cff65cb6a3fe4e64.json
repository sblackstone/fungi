It was later placed in the genus ''[[Clitocybe]]'' in 1871 by [[Paul Kummer]] as ''Clitocybe nebularis''. After much consideration by many mycologists, over some years, when it was placed for periods in both ''[[Lepista]]'', and ''[[Gymnopus]]'', it was placed back in ''Clitocybe'' with the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]], and 1871 creditation it retains today.<br>''Clitocybe nebularis'' var. ''alba'' Bataille (1911), differs only in having a milk white cap, and is very rare.<ref name=Phillips/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the mushroom is 5\u201325&nbsp;cm (2\u20138&nbsp;in) in diameter, [[wikt:convex|convex]] with an incurved margin, becoming plane to depressed in shape. Cap colours are generally greyish to light brownish-grey, and often covered in a whitish bloom when young. The surface of the cap is usually dry to moist, and radially fibrillose. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is stout, swollen towards the base, becomes hollow with age, and is easily broken. It is usually somewhat lighter than the cap.<ref name=Phillips/> The flesh is white, and very thick. It has a foul-smelling [[odour]], which has been described as slightly farinaceous to rancid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Clitocybe_nebularis.html |title=California Fungi: Clitocybe nebularis |accessdate=2008-01-11 |work= }}</ref> <br> This species is host to the parasitic gilled mushroom ''[[Volvariella surrecta]]'', which is found on older specimens.\n \nIt may be confused with the poisonous ''[[Entoloma sinuatum]]'' both in Europe or North America, though this species has pink sinuate gills.<ref name=Haas69>{{cite book | author = Haas H | year = 1969 | title = The Young Specialist looks at Fungi |pages=128| publisher = Burke | isbn = 0-222-79409-7}}</ref>\n\n===Edibility===\nIt is widely consumed but is 'generally considered better to be avoided'.<ref>Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe - Michael Jordan</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Cluded Agaric pileus.JPG|The Pileus or cap\nFile:Clouded Agaric Gills.JPG|Detail of the gills\nFile:Clouded Agaric underside.JPG|The gills and cut stipe (stalk)\nFile:Hexenring Nebelgrauer Trichterling.JPG|''C. nebularis'' growing in a [[fairy ring]] formation\nNevelzwam ( nebularis) (d.j.b.) 02.jpg|Close up of the top of a fully Clitocybe nebularis.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Clitocybe nebularis\">{{cite web |title=''Clitocybe nebularis'' (Batsch) P.

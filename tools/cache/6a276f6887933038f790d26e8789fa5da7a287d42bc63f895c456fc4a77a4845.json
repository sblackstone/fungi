In English it is sometimes called '''cauliflower fungus'''.<ref name=Phillips/>\n\n==Description==\n''S. crispa'' grows in an entangled globe that is up to {{convert|24|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter.  The lobes, which carry the spore-bearing surface, are flat and curly, resembling lasagna noodles and they are coloured white to creamy yellow.  When young they are tough and rubbery but later they become soft.  The odour is pleasant and the taste of the flesh mild.  \n\nThe spore print is cream, the smooth oval spores measuring about 7&nbsp;\u00b5m by 5&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Bon/>\n\nThis species is found growing at the base of [[conifer]] trunks, often [[pine]]s, but also [[spruce]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[larch]] and others.  It is fairly common in Great Britain.<ref name=Kibby/>\n\n==Culinary use==\nIt is considered a good edible fungus when young and fresh<ref name=Bon/>, though it is difficult to clean (a toothbrush and lots of running water are recommended for that process).  One French cookbook, which gives four recipes for this species, says that grubs and pine needles can get caught up in holes in the jumbled mass of flesh.  The ''Sparassis'' should be blanched in boiling water for 2-3 minutes before being added to the rest of the dish. <ref name=Jaunault/><ref name=Phillips/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Bon>{{cite book |author=Marcel Bon |title=The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North-western Europe |publisher=Domino Books Ltd. |location=7 Bond Street, St. Helier, Jersey |year=1987 |page=308 |isbn=978-0-340-39935-4 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Jaunault>{{cite book |authors=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jaunault, Jean-Luc Brillet |title=Toutes les bases de la cuisine aux champignons |publisher=Editions Ouest-France |location=13 rue du Breil, Rennes, France |year=1981 |page=183 |language=French |isbn=2 7373 2275 8 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kibby>{{cite book |author=Geoffrey Kibby |title=Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain & Europe Vol. 1 |publisher=Geoffrey Kibby |year=2017 |page=82 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Phillips>{{cite book |author=Roger Phillips |title=Mushrooms and other fungi of Great Britain & Europe |publisher=Pan Books |location=Cavaye Place, London SW10 9PG |year=1998 |page=255 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{commonscat}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q36992}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1781]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Polyporales]]"}]}}}}

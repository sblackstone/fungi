The mushrooms have olive-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s up to {{convert|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter atop slender [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] that are {{convert|50|to|80|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} long by {{convert|0.7|to|1.2|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} thick. On the underside of the cap are the distantly spaced, whitish [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]] that have cross-veins running between them. Microscopic characteristics of the mushroom include the smooth, irregularly cylindrical cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge), the absence of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), the [[diverticulum|diverticulate]] elements of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]], the broadly club-shaped to irregularly shaped [[caulocystidia]] (cystidia on the stem), the weakly [[dextrinoid]] [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] ([[staining]] reddish to reddish-brown in [[Melzer's reagent]]), and the absence of [[clamp connection]]s. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown.\n\n==Taxonom and naming==\nThe mushroom was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999, and published as a new species (along with seven other Japanese Mycenas) in a 2007 publication. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is from the [[Latin]] word ''intersecta'' or \"intersected\", and refers to the [[wikt:intervenose|intervenose]] gills. Its Japanese name is ''Oriibu-ashinagatake'' (\u30aa\u30ea\u30fc\u30d6\u30a2\u30b7\u30ca\u30ac\u30bf\u30b1).<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\nAccording to Takahashi, the fungus is best [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Fragilipedes'' (Fr.) Qu\u00e9l., as defined by the Dutch ''Mycena'' specialist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus|Maas Geesteranus]].<ref name=Takahaski2007/><ref name=MaasGeesteranus1980/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''M.&nbsp;intersecta'' is initially conical to convex to bell-shaped, eventually reaching {{convert|8|to|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. When it is moist, it is partly translucent, so that the outlines of the gills underneath the cap can be seen. The cap is somewhat [[hygrophanous]], and dry. Its surface is initially minutely [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (as if covered with a fine white powder), but this effect soon sloughs off, leaving the surface smooth. The cap color is initially olive-brown to yellowish-brown, then somewhat paler from the margin. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to 0.7&nbsp;mm thick, and lacks any distinctive taste and odor. The slender [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|50|to|80|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} long by {{convert|0.7|to|1.2|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} thick, cylindrical, and hollow. Its surface is dry, and colored pale olive-brown near the top, becoming olive-brown downward. Like the cap, it is at first pruinose, but smooths out in age. The base of the stem is covered with coarse white hairs. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[adnation|adnate]] to subdecurrent (running slightly down the length of the stem), and distantly spaced, with 16\u201319 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to 1.5&nbsp;mm broad, thin, somewhat intervenose, and whitish, with edges that are the same color as the gill faces. Takahashi's description does not include any discussion of the mushroom's [[edible mushroom|edibility]].<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[basidiospore]]s are roughly [[ellipsoid]] and measure 7.5\u20138.5 by 5\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. They are thin-walled, smooth, colorless, and [[inamyloid]] to weakly amyloid\u2014indicating a weak ability to absorb the iodine in [[Melzer's reagent]]. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]] are 22\u201331 by 5.5\u20137&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]], club-shaped, and mostly two-spored. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are 27\u201340 by 3\u20136&nbsp;\u03bcm, abundant, and form a sterile gill edge. They are irregularly cylindrical to constricted, smooth, colorless, and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] tissue is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 5\u201318&nbsp;\u03bcm wide, cylindrical, smooth, colorless, and weakly [[dextrinoid]]. The [[Pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2\u20136&nbsp;\u03bcm wide, cylindrical, and densely covered with warty or finger-like thin-walled [[diverticulum|diverticulae]] that are colorless and inamyloid. The layer of hyphae underneath the cap cuticle are parallel, olive-brown, and weakly dextrinoid, with short and inflated cells up to 22&nbsp;\u03bcm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2\u20134&nbsp;\u03bcm wide, cylindrical, smooth to sparsely diverticulate. These hyphae curve outward to form club-shaped or irregularly shaped caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are olive-brown, inamyloid, and thin-walled. They measure 13\u201329 by 3\u20137&nbsp;\u03bcm, and are broadly club-shaped to irregularly shaped, and often have one to three knob-like [[wikt:excrescence|excrescences]]. The stem tissue is made of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 5\u201312&nbsp;\u03bcm wide, smooth, colorless, and have a weakly dextrinoid in Melzer's reagent. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent in all tissues of ''M.&nbsp;intersecta''.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\nThe European species ''[[Mycena viridimarginata]]'' is somewhat similar to ''M.&nbsp;intersecta'' in appearance, but may be distinguished by its greenish-edged gills, cheilocystidia with abruptly tapering points, and [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Mycena intersecta'' is known only from [[Kanagawa]], Japan. The fruit bodies are found solitary or scattered, on dead leaves in lowland forests dominated by the [[oak]] trees ''[[Quercus myrsinaefolia]]'' and ''[[Quercus serrata|Q.&nbsp;serrata]]''.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Fungorum>{{cite web |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=532057 |title=Index Fungorum \u2013 Names Record |publisher=CAB International |work= |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=MaasGeesteranus1980>{{cite journal |author=Maas Geesteranus RA. |title=Studies in Mycenas 15.

It has a distinctive bright yellow colour and an unusual smell likened to coal gas. It occurs in deciduous woodlands in Europe from spring to autumn.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Tricholoma sulphureum'' was first [[species description|described]] in 1784 by the French botanist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] and given the name ''Agaricus sulphureus'', before being placed in the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]'' by German mycologist [[Paul Kummer]] in 1871. The specific epithet ''sulf\u01d4r\u011bus'' derived from the [[Latin]] 'of or pertaining to [[sulfur]]'.<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| year = 1979|edition = 5th|location = London| isbn=0-304-52257-0|page = 883}}</ref> It belongs to a complex of similar foul-smelling species such as ''[[Tricholoma inamoenum]]''. Another related species, ''T. bufonium'', may be an intraspecific variant.\n\n==Description==\nIt has a convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with a vague [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} across, sulphur yellow in colour. The thick, sinuate [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] and [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] are similarly bright yellow. The smell, caused by the chemical [[skatole]], is enough to distinguish it from other yellow fungi. [[John Ramsbottom (mycologist)|John Ramsbottom]] reports that it has a complex smell that has been likened variously to [[Jasmine]], ''[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]]'', [[Hyacinth (plant)|Hyacinth]], ''[[Hemerocallis flava]]'', [[Lilac]], ''[[Tagetes]]'', decayed [[hemp]] or [[coal gas]], as well as described as nauseating or foetid.<ref>*{{cite book | author = Ramsbottom J | year = 1953 | title = Mushrooms & Toadstools | publisher = Collins | id = ISBN }}</ref> The taste is bitter.\n\nIt could be confused with the darker ''[[Tricholoma equestre|T. equestre]]'', though the latter has a sticky cap, white flesh, thin crowded gills, and a mealy smell.<ref name=Haas69/> However this latter species which was formerly considered a good [[edible mushroom]], would have itself caused sporadic cases of poisoning.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Tricholoma sulphureum'' is found in [[deciduous]] woods, particularly [[beech]], and can occur anytime from spring until autumn.<ref name=Haas69>{{cite book | author = Haas H | year = 1969 | title = The Young Specialist looks at Fungi| publisher = Burke | isbn = 0-222-79409-7 |page=148}}</ref> It is found across Europe and has been confirmed as far east as China.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Deng H, Yao YJ |year=2005 |title=Revision of three species of ''Tricholoma'' reported from China|journal=Mycotaxon|volume=92|pages=77\u201384 |issn=0093-4666}}</ref> It is also distributed in North America,<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Bessette AE, Bessette AR, Roody WC, Trudell SA |year=2012 |title=Tricholomas of North America}}</ref> where it grows also with conifers.

In Turkey, it is considered [[critically endangered]].<ref name=\"\u00c7inar 2014\"/>\n\n==Toxicity==\nThe fungus is usually classified as inedible in guidebooks, although there have been reports of poisoning.

It is widespread and common in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in Japan and Venezuela. It is [[saprotrophic]]\u2014meaning that it obtains nutrients by consuming decomposing organic matter\u2014and the [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] appear in small groups or clusters on the decaying logs, trunks, and stumps of [[deciduous]] trees, particularly [[beech]]. The fungus, first described scientifically in 1799, is [[Biological classification|classified]] in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Lactipedes'' of the genus ''[[Mycena]]'', along with other species that produce a milky or colored [[latex]].\n\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are up to {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} wide, whitish [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]], and a thin, fragile reddish-brown [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] with thick coarse hairs at the base. They are characterized by their reddish color, the scalloped cap edges, and the dark red latex they \"bleed\" when cut or broken. Both the fruit bodies and the [[mycelium|mycelia]] are weakly [[bioluminescent]]. ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' produces various [[alkaloid]] [[pigment]]s unique to this species. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the fruit bodies is not known definitively.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe species was initially named ''Agaricus haematopus'' by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1799,<ref name=\"Persoon1799\"/> and later [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] under this name by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in his 1821 ''Systema Mycologicum''.<ref name=Fries1821/> In the [[classification (biology)|classification]] of Fries, only a few genera were named, and most [[agaric]] mushrooms were grouped in ''Agaricus'', which was organized into a large number of [[tribe (biology)|tribes]]. ''Mycena haematopus'' gained its current name in 1871 when the German fungal taxonomist [[Paul Kummer]] raised many of Fries' ''Agaricus'' tribes to the level of genus, including ''[[Mycena]]''.<ref name=\"Kummer1871\"/> In 1909 [[Franklin Sumner Earle]] placed the species in ''Galactopus'',<ref name=\"Earle1909\"/> a genus that is no longer considered separate from ''Mycena''.<ref name=Kirk2008/> ''Mycena haematopus'' is [[classification (biology)|placed]] in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Lactipedes'', a grouping of Mycenas characterized by the presence of a milky or colored latex in the stem and flesh of the cap.<ref>Smith, 1947, p. 132.</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] roots meaning \"blood\" (\u03b1\u1f31\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf-, ''haimato-'') and \"foot\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, ''pous'').<ref name=\"urlTom Volks FOTM\"/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the blood-foot mushroom, the bleeding fairy helmet,<ref name=\"Sept2006\"/> the burgundydrop bonnet,<ref name=\"urlThe magic of Britains wild mushrooms - Telegraph\"/> or the bleeding Mycena.<ref name=\"Hall2003\"/>\n\nIn 1914, [[Jakob Emanuel Lange]] described the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' var. ''marginata'', characterized by the reddish color on the edge of the gills;<ref name=Lange1914/> ''Mycena'' specialist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus]] considered the coloration of the gill edge too variable to have taxonomical significance.<ref name=\"Geesteranus1988\"/> ''Mycena haematopus'' var. ''cuspidata'' was initially found in [[Colorado]] in 1976, and described as a new [[variety (botany)|variety]] by American mycologists [[Duane Mitchel]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]] two years later. The fruit bodies are characterized by a \"beak\" on the cap that often splits or collapses as the cap matures.<ref name=\"Mitchel1978\"/> It was treated as ''[[Mycena sanguinolenta]]'' var. ''cuspidata'' by Maas Geesteranus in 1988.<ref name=\"Geesteranus1988\"/>\n\n==Description==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Mycena haematopus 19292.jpg|image2=Mycena haematopus 35406.jpg|width=200|caption1=Young fruit bodies are ''pruinose''\u2014as if covered with a fine white powder.|caption2=Cut or injured mushroom tissue oozes a reddish latex.|alt1=A cluster of purplish-red mushrooms on their sides showing the underside of their caps.|alt2=The underside of some light-pink mushrooms caps with small beads of reddish liquid on the gills.}}\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''Mycena haematopus'' are the reproductive structures produced by cellular threads or [[hypha]]e which grow in rotting wood. The shape of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the fruit body will vary depending on its maturity. Young caps, or \"buttons\", are [[wikt:ovoid|ovoid]] (egg-shaped) to conical; later they are campanulate (bell-shaped), and as the fruit body matures, the margins (cap edge) lift upward so that the cap becomes somewhat flat with an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] (a central nipple-shaped bump).<ref name=\"Orr1979\"/> The fully grown cap can reach up to {{convert|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The surface of the cap initially appears dry and covered with what appears to be a very fine whitish powder, but it soon becomes polished and moist. Mature caps appear somewhat translucent, and develop radial grooves mirroring the position of the gills underneath.<ref name=\"Smith1947\"/> The color of the cap is reddish- or pinkish-brown, often tinged with violet, and paler towards the edge. The margin is wavy like the edge of a scallop, and may appear ragged because of lingering remnants of the [[partial veil]].\n\nThe mushroom [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] can range from pale to the color of [[wine (color)|red wine]] (vinaceous), and has no distinctive odor. It oozes a red latex when cut.<ref name=\"Hall2003\"/> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an [[adnation|adnate]] attachment to the stem, meaning they are more or less directly attached to it. They are initially whitish or \"grayish vinaceous\" in color, and can develop reddish-brown stains. Between 20 and 30 gills reach from the cap edge to the stem, resulting in a gill spacing that is described as \"close to subdistant\"\u2014gaps are visible between adjacent gills. There are additional gills, called lamellulae, that do not extend directly from the margin to the stem; these are arranged in two or three series (tiers) of equal length. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|0.1|to|0.2|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, hollow and brittle, and a dark reddish-brown color. In young fruit bodies, the upper part of the stem is densely covered with a pale cinnamon-colored powder which wears off with age. The stem has a mass of coarse hairs at the base. Like the cap, the stem also bleeds a red latex when it is cut or broken.<ref name=\"Orr1979\"/><ref name=\"Smith1947\"/>\n\n''Mycena haematopus'' can be [[parasitism|parasitized]] by ''[[Spinellus fusiger]]'', another fungal species which gives the mushroom a strikingly hairy appearance.<ref name=\"urlTom Volks FOTM\"/><ref name=\"Healy2008\"/>\n[[image:Spinellus fusiger 51504.jpg|thumb|right|''Mycena haematopus'' parasitized by the bonnet mold ''Spinellus fusiger''|alt=A cluster of pinkish mushrooms with caps covered with whitish hairs]]\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore print]] is white. The [[spore]]s are elliptical, smooth, with dimensions of 8\u201311 by 5\u20137&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning they will absorb [[iodine]] when stained with [[Melzer's reagent]].<ref name=\"Healy2008\"/> The spore-bearing cells ([[basidia]]) are 4-spored. Sterile cells called [[cystidia]] are numerous on the edges on the gills; they measure 33\u201360&nbsp;\u00b5m (sometimes up to 80) by 9\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m. Cystidia that are present on the stipe (caulocystidia) appear in clusters, and clublike to irregular in shape, measuring 20\u201355 by 3.5\u201312.5&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=\"urlMycenas of Norway\"/> The gill tissue contains numerous lactifers, cells that produce the latex that is secreted when it is cut.<ref name=\"Smith1947\"/>\n\nThe surface [[mycelia|mycelium]] of ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' is whitish and fluffy. Swelling at the terminal tips of hyphae (diameter up to 12&nbsp;\u00b5m) is present, but not very abundant, and [[wikt:moniliform|moniliform]] hyphae are very rare. [[Bioluminescence]] is present, but weak. Extracellular [[oxidase]] enzymes are present, consistent with its ecological role as a [[detritivore|saprobe]].<ref name=\"Treu1990\"/>\n\n===Edibility===\nAlthough some sources claim that ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]],<ref name=McKnight1987/><ref name=\"Arora1986\"/> it is \"hardly worth collecting because of its small size.\"<ref name=\"Hall2003\"/> Other sources consider the species inedible,<ref name=Jordan2004/> or recommend avoiding consumption, \"since most of them have not yet been tested for toxins.\"<ref name=\"urlTom Volks FOTM\"/> The taste of the mushroom is mild to slightly bitter.<ref name=\"urlMushroomExpert.Com\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nAnother ''Mycena'' that produces a reddish latex is ''[[Mycena sanguinolenta]]'', the \"terrestrial bleeding Mycena\". It may be distinguished from ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' in several ways: it is smaller, with cap diameters between {{convert|0.3|to|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide; grows in groups rather than clusters; is found on leaves, dead branches, moss beds and pine needle beds rather than decaying wood; and the edges of its gills are consistently dark brownish-red.<ref>Smith, 1947, pp. 146\u201349.</ref> Furthermore, range of cap color in ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' is different than in ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'', varying from reddish-to orange-brown, and it lacks a band of partial veil remnants hanging from the margin.<ref name=\"Arora1986\"/>\n\n==Ecology, distribution and habitat==\n[[image:Mycena haematopus 56359.jpg|thumb|right|Fruit bodies typically grow in clusters joined at a common base.|alt=A cluster of about a dozen pinkish-purple mushrooms growing from the stump of a tree]]\n''Mycena haematopus'' obtains nutrients from decomposing organic matter ([[saprobic]]) and the fruit bodies can typically be found growing on stumps and well-decayed logs, usually in groups that are joined together by a common base. The decomposition of woody debris on the forest floor is the result of the combined activity of a community of fungal species. In the sequential [[ecological succession|succession]] of mushrooms species, ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' is a \"late colonizer\" fungus: its fruit bodies appear after the wood has first been decayed by [[white rot]] species. The initial stage of wood decay by white rot fungi involves the breakdown of \"acid-unhydrolyzable residue\" and holocellulose (a mixture of [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]]).<ref name=\"Fukasawa2008\"/>\n\nIn North America, ''Mycena haematopus'' is known to be distributed from [[Alaska]] southward.<ref name=\"Orr1979\"/> According to ''Mycena'' specialist [[Alexander H. Smith]], it is \"the commonest and the most easily recognized one in the genus.\"<ref name=Smith1947/> The species is common in Europe,<ref name=\"Hall2003\"/> and it has also been collected from Japan,<ref name=\"Desjardin2008\"/> and [[M\u00e9rida (state)|M\u00e9rida]], Venezuela, as the variety ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' var. ''marginata''.<ref name=\"Dennis1961\"/> In the Netherlands, ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' is one of many mushrooms that can regularly be found fruiting on ancient timber [[wharf|wharves]].<ref name=\"Den Held-Jager1979\"/> The fruit bodies can be found year-round in mild weather.<ref name=\"Bessette1997\"/>\n\n==Bioluminescence==\nBoth the mycelia<ref name=\"Treu1990\"/> and the fruit bodies of ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' (both young and mature specimens) are reported to be [[bioluminescent]]. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the [[dark adaptation|dark-adapted]] eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20&nbsp;hours of [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] to [[photographic film|X-ray film]].<ref name=\"Bermudes1992\"/> Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence is caused by the action of [[luciferase]]s, enzymes that produce light by the [[oxidation]] of a [[luciferin]] (a [[pigment]]).<ref name=Shimomura2010/> The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal,<ref name=\"Sivinski1981\"/> it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions,<ref name=\"Buller1924\"/> or it may help deter [[heterotroph]]s that might consume the fungus.<ref name=\"Sivinski1981\"/>\n\n==Natural products==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Haematopodin B.png\n| width1 = 110\n| alt1 = Chemical structure of haematopodin B\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Haematopodin.png\n| width2 = 110\n| alt2 = Chemical structure of haematopodin\n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Haematopodin B]] (left) and its more stable breakdown product [[Haematopodin]] (right)\n}}\nSeveral unique chemicals are produced by ''Mycena haematopus''. The primary [[pigment]] is [[haematopodin B|haematopodin&nbsp;B]], which is so chemically sensitive (breaking down upon exposure to air and light) that its more stable breakdown product, [[haematopodin]],<ref name=\"Baumann1993\"/> was known before its eventual discovery and characterization in 2008.<ref name=\"Peters2008\"/> A [[organic synthesis|chemical synthesis]] for haematopodin was reported in 1996.<ref name=\"Hopmann1996\"/> Haematopodins are the first pyrroloquinoline [[alkaloid]]s discovered in fungi; pyrroloquinolines combine the structures of [[pyrrole]] and [[quinoline]], both [[heterocyclic]] [[aromatic]] [[organic compound]]s. Compounds of this type also occur in [[marine sponge]]s and are attracting research interest due to various [[biological activity|biological properties]], such as [[cytotoxic]]ity against tumor [[cell culture|cell lines]], and both [[antifungal drug|antifungal]] and [[antimicrobial]] activities.<ref name=\"Baumann1993\"/> Additional alkaloid compounds in ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' include the red pigments mycenarubins D, E and F. Prior to the discovery of these compounds, pyrroloquinoline alkaloids were considered to be rare in terrestrial sources.<ref name=\"Peters2008\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bioluminescent fungi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Arora1986\">{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley |year=1986 |page=231 |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86tM01VsFG0C&pg=PA232}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Baumann1993\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Baumann C, Br\u00f6ckelmann M, Fugmann B, Steffan B, Steglich W, Sheldrick WS |year=1993 |title=Pigments of fungi. 62.

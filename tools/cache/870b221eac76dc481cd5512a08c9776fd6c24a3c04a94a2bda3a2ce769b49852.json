The inedible [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are small, pale gray-brown mushrooms with broadly conical [[pileus (mycology)|caps]], pinkish [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]]. They are found in small troops on stumps and branches of [[deciduous]] and occasionally [[coniferous]] trees. The mushroom is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it is typically found on twigs or buried wood, carrying out its role in the [[forest ecology|forest ecosystem]] by [[decomposer|decomposing]] organic matter, [[nutrient cycling|recycling nutrients]], and forming [[humus]] in the soil. ''M.&nbsp;polygramma'' contains two uncommon [[hydroxyl|hydroxy]] [[fatty acid]]s and is also a [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] fungus whose intensity of [[light emission]] follows a [[diurnal rhythm|diurnal]] pattern.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nFirst called ''Agaricus polygrammus'' by French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Jean Bulliard]] in 1789,<ref name=Bulliard1789/> the species was later [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] under that name by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in his ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]''.<ref name=Fries1821/> It was soon after transferred into the genus ''[[Mycena]]'' in 1821 by [[Samuel Frederick Gray]],<ref name=Gray1821/> who raised many of Fries' sub-generic divisions to the genus level. ''Agaricus chloroticus'',  described by [[Friedrich Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn]] in 1830, is the only known [[synonym (biology)|taxonomic synonym]].<ref name=Doerfelt1986/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2 meaning \"many\" and \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ae, or \"line\".<ref name=Rea1922/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"grooved bonnet\".<ref name=BMS/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mycena spec. - Lindsey 15b.jpg|thumb|left|The gills are squarely attached to the stem, and flushed with pink in maturity.]]\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the ''M.&nbsp;polygramma'' fruit body is {{convert|2|to|4|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, and initially egg- to cone-shaped, but expands to become conic to bell-shaped or nearly convex with an abrupt small [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], or at times plane with a conic umbo. On young fruit bodies, the cap margin is slightly curved inward, and frequently has scalloped edges; in maturity the margin flares out, or is [[wikt:recurved|recurved]] and wavy. The surface of the cap is initially covered with short, fine whitish or grayish hairs that often persist until near maturity. With age, the cap surface becomes smooth, the color dark brownish-gray to black beneath the bloom, fading slowly to a pale gray, and nearly pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]] at times. The cap margin is [[wikt:opaque|opaque]] and frequently has narrow, deep furrows or grooves, with the surface often more or less uneven and appearing as if streaked with glistening lines. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is very hard and [[wikt:cartilaginous|cartilaginous]], watery grayish to white, rather thin, and with no distinctive odor and a mild taste.<ref name=Smithp292-93/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are narrowly adnate (attached squarely to the stem) or have a short decurrent tooth, and are packed close together, with 30\u201338 gills reaching the stem. They are broad anteriorly (4\u20137&nbsp;mm), white or whitish, in age flushed with pink, often with sordid-brownish stains, and with edges pallid and even. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|6|to|15|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long, {{convert|0.2|to|0.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} thick, very brittle and cartilaginous, equal, and tubular. It sometimes has a well-developed pseudorrhiza that resembles white cotton, and the base is covered with stiff white hairs, and often it stains reddish brown. The surface has fine straight or sometimes twisted longitudinal striations. The surface is ashy-gray or paler grayish-brown beneath the silvery covering, at times nearly smooth, with the apex pallid and faintly powdered.<ref name=Smithp292-93/>\n[[File:Bulliard Herbier de la France 1789 plate 395.jpg|thumb|right|Various images of ''M.&nbsp;polygramma'' from Bulliard's ''Herbier de la France'', 1789]] ''Mycena polygramma'' is a [[bioluminescent]] mushroom, although the extent of luminescence can vary considerably.<ref name=Griffin1996/> The mushroom is inedible,<ref name=Jordan2004/> and has a mild to slightly [[wikt:acrid|acrid]] taste and a \"pleasant\" odor.<ref name=Rogers/>\n\n===Microscopic features===\nCollected in deposit, such as in a [[spore print]], the [[basidiospore|spores]] appear white. Viewed with a [[light microscope]], the spores are broadly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] in shape, smooth, [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], with dimensions of 7.5\u201310 by 5\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. Occasionally the spores contain oil droplets.<ref name=Jordan2004/> The [[basidium|basidia]] (pore-bearing cells) are four-spored, 26\u201330 by 7\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[wikt:cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] are scattered to abundant, [[wikt:aciculate|aciculate]] or with the midportion somewhat enlarged and the apex forked or branched, and give rise to two or several contorted finger-like projections. [[wikt:pleurocystidium|Pleurocystidia]] are not differentiated.<ref name=Smithp292-93/>\n\n===Similar species===\nTall and slender forms of ''Mycena polygramma'' somewhat resemble ''[[Mycena pullata|M.&nbsp;pullata]]'' or ''[[Mycena praelonga|M.&nbsp;praelonga]]''. The former species is distinguished by its color, and the latter by its relationship to ''[[Mycena alcalina|M.&nbsp;alcalina]]'' and its habitat on [[sphagnum]].<ref name=Smith1937/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\nThe fruit bodies of ''M.&nbsp;polygramma'' grow in groups or sub-clusters under [[hardwood]]s, particularly deciduous trees such as [[oak]], [[maple]], and [[basswood]]. In North America, it has been collected from [[North Carolina]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Michigan]], where it fruits from June to October.<ref name=Smithp292-93/> The fruit bodies are susceptible to attack by the [[parasitism|parasitic]] fungi ''[[Spinellus fusiger]]'' and ''[[Spinellus macrocarpus|S.&nbsp;macrocarpus]]''.<ref name=Atkinson1900/>\n\nTypically found on twigs or buried wood,<ref name=Rogers/> the fungus is known to be a vigorous decomposer of [[lignin]] and [[cellulose]] in [[leaf litter]].<ref name=Osono2002/> ''Mycena polygramma'' is a [[saprobic]] fungus, and is one of many fungi that contribute to [[plant litter]] decomposition in forest ecosystems through nutrient recycling and [[humus]] formation in soil. It is a [[wikt:lignocellulose|lignocellulose]] decomposer of [[larch]] litter, and can break down both [[lignin]] and [[carbohydrate]]s, although it has a preference for carbohydrates.<ref name=Osonu2003/> In an experiment testing the ability of several litter-decomposing fungi to remove lignin from leaves of the [[wikt:perennial|perennial]] grass ''[[Miscanthus sinensis]]'', under pure culture conditions, ''M.&nbsp;polygramma'' showed limited ability to cause the mass loss of lignin.<ref name=Osono2010/>\n\nRare in North America,<ref name=Smithp292-93/> the fungus is common in Europe, including Great Britain.<ref name=Jordan2004/> They have been collected on the [[Falkland Islands]],<ref name=Pegler1980/> and Japan.<ref name=Osono2002/>\n\n==Chemistry and bioluminescence==\n''Mycena polygramma'' contains the unusual [[hydroxyl|hydroxy]] [[fatty acid]]s 7-hydroxy-8,14-dimethyl-9-hexadecenoic acid (0.05% of the total fatty acids) and 7-hydroxy-8,16-dimethyl-9-octadecenoic acid (0.01%).<ref name=Dembitsky1993/>\n\nThe fungus is one of several dozen ''Mycena'' species that are [[bioluminescent]].<ref name=Desjardin2008/> Unlike most luminescent organisms, ''M.&nbsp;polygramma'' has a [[diurnal rhythm]] of luminescence intensity, and has rises and falls of light intensity as high as 35 percent. However, this light emission is not typically noticed, as it can not be detected visually  by the [[dark-adapted]] eye; sensitive [[photomultiplier]]s or long [[exposure time]]s are required to measure the phenomenon.<ref name=Berliner1961/> The wavelength of [[spectral emissions]] from the fungus grown in pure culture is in the range 470\u2013640&nbsp;m\u03bc.<ref name=Berliner1961b/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bioluminescent fungi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Atkinson1900>{{cite book |author=Atkinson GF. |year=1900 |title=Studies of American fungi.

It has a worldwide distribution and is found growing on rotting wood. It is considered inedible by mushroomers because of its bitter taste. It is a common mushroom, but collections are at their peak during late summer. The opening of the outer layer of the fruiting body in the characteristic star shape is thought to be due to a buildup of [[calcium oxalate]] crystals immediately prior to [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]]. ''G.&nbsp;saccatum'' is distinguished from other earthstars by the distinct circular ridge or depression surrounding the central pore.

Initially, the fruiting body is egg-shaped&ndash;similar in appearance to [[puffballs]]&ndash;and has strands of [[mycelia]] (rhizomorphs) at the base that attach it to the growing surface. The 'skin,' or [[peridium]], is composed of two separate layers: the outer layer (''exoperidium''), which is a golden tan to yellowish-brown color, separates away from the inner [[basidiocarp]] and splits into several rays that curve backward (recurve) to the base. The mushroom is {{convert|2|to|5|cm|in}} in diameter after the rays have expanded. Unlike some other members of the genus ''[[Geastrum]]'' (such as ''[[Geastrum fornicatum]]'') the arms do not push the basidiocarp off the ground; rather, it lies flat. The inner spore-bearing basidiocarp is {{convert|0.5|to|2|cm|in}} broad, and has a central pore surrounded by a circular dull-brown apical disc; the disc is distinctly ridged or depressed.<ref name=\"isbn0-02-063690-3\"/> The inside of the interior sphere is white when young, but matures into a mass of brown, powdery spores mixed with thick-walled fibres known as [[capillitium]].<ref name=\"isbn1-58729-627-6\"/>\n\n[[File:Geastrum.Saccatum.002.jpg|thumb|A fresh specimen of ''Geastrum saccatum''.]]\n\n===Spores===\n\nThe [[spore]]s are rounded, with warts, and have dimensions of 3.5&ndash;4.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]].<ref name=\"isbn1-58729-627-6\">{{cite book |vauthors=Healy RA, Huffman DR, Tiffany LH, Knaphaus G |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of the Midcontinental United States (Bur Oak Guide) |publisher=University of Iowa Press |location=Iowa City |year=2008 |page=243 |isbn=978-1-58729-627-7 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\n''Geastrum&nbsp;saccatum'' is [[saprobic]], and grows scattered or clustered together in leaf litter of [[humus]], usually in late summer and fall.

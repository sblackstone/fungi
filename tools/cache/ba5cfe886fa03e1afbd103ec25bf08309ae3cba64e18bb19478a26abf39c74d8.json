Worldwide, straw mushrooms rank third in consumption, although their use in the West is somewhat uncommon and usually confined to use in Oriental cooking.\n<ref name=\"Straw Mushroom\">{{cite web |title=Straw Mushrooms|url=https://www.mssf.org/cookbook/straw.html}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation ==\nStraw mushrooms are grown on rice straw beds and are most commonly picked when immature (often labeled \"unpeeled\"), during their button or egg phase and before the veil ruptures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0luzyrBPARgC&pg=PA120&lpg=PA120&dq=straw+mushrooms+veil+ruptures&source=bl&ots=DNqWryuilC&sig=yoP8IXXgAhjQLRXS1wFsIvEtwmQ&hl=en&ei=zao8TOXFIYGclgezw5iJAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Tropical Mushrooms: Biological Nature and Cultivation Methods|first1=S.

The two mushrooms have different distributions, with the death cap generally not found where the straw mushroom grows natively, but immigrants, particularly those from Southeast Asia to California and Australia, have been poisoned due to misidentification.<ref name=\"Money 2004\">{{cite book |author=Money NP. |title=Mr. Bloomfield's Orchard: The Mysterious World of Mushrooms, Molds, and Mycologists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ROa52_3bUwC&pg=PA153 |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-517158-7 |page=153}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/two-die-after-eating-death-cap-mushrooms-20120104-1pk38.html|title=Two die after eating death cap mushrooms|first=Stephanie|last=Gardiner|date=3 January 2012|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikisource|Coloured figures of English fungi or mushrooms/Volume 1/Tab. 1}}\n* [http://www.mssf.org/cookbook/straw.html Straw Mushroom]\n* http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=307802\n* http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=307802\n{{Commonscat}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q641656}}\n\n[[Category:Pluteaceae]]\n[[Category:Chinese edible mushrooms]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1786]]\n[[Category:Fungi in cultivation]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n\n\n{{Agaricales-stub}}"}]}}}}

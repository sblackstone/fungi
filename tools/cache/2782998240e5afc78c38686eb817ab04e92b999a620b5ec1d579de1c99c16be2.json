It is a white [[mushroom]] originally described from [[Texas]] but today found in nine states of North America. It was named after [[Harry Delbert Thiers]]. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of this small mushroom is white and convex, measuring {{convert|35|\u2013|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} and covered by [[Volva (mycology)|volval]] remnants. It is sticky to the touch when wet. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are variable in length and number and are densely packed in some specimens and widely spaced in others. They are not attached to the [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], which is {{convert|8|\u2013|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} long and about {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, with a white [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[Spore (mycology)|spores]] measure 7.8\u20139.8 by 7.3\u20139.0&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]] and are roughly spherical in shape. The [[spore print]] is white.\n\nThe mushroom grows in lawns, pastures and prairies. It is a [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotroph]], living on decaying plant material, and not [[mycorrhizal]] as is the case with  ''Amanita'' species.  Previously it was placed in ''Amanita'', but in 2016 the saprophytic members of that genus were separated off into the new genus ''[[Saproamanita]]'' by one research group, though this split is controversial.<ref name=Redheadetal2016/><ref name=\"urlFungorum\"/> Fruit bodies appear during July and August, either in isolation or in groups, and often form [[fairy ring]]s. The [[genome]] of ''S. thiersii'' is being [[genome sequencing|sequenced]] as part of the United States Department of Energy's [[Joint Genome Institute]] Community Sequencing Program. It is hoped that this will provide a better understanding of the [[cellulose]] decomposition capabilities of the fungus. The toxicity of ''S. thiersii'' has not been studied but it is suspected of being [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Sapromanita thiersii'' was first [[species description|described]] in 1957 by Harry Delbert Thiers, an American [[mycologist]], who had spotted it on a [[campus]] lawn when he was a student.<ref name=Metzler/> He named it ''Amanita alba'' but that name was disallowed as it had already been used for another species. In 1969 it was renamed by the Dutch mycologist [[Cornelis Bas]] as ''Amanita thiersii'' in honour of its finder.<ref name=wolfe/> It used to be placed in the genus ''Amanita''<ref name=\"tulloss1\" /> in the [[Section (botany)|section]] ''Lepidella'' and subsection ''Vittadiniae''.<ref name=subsection/> Bas created the stirps (an informal ranking below species level) ''Thiersii'', in which he placed ''S. thiersii'' along with ''[[Amanita albofloccosa|A.&nbsp;albofloccosa]]'', ''[[Amanita aureofloccosa|A.&nbsp;aureofloccosa]]'', ''[[Amanita foetens|A.&nbsp;foetens]]'' and ''[[Amanita praeclara|A.&nbsp;praeclara]]''.<ref name=\"tulloss1\" /> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] called \"Thiers' lepidella\".<ref name=\"tulloss1\" />\n\nThen in 2016 Scott Redhead and his associates created the genus ''[[Saproamanita]]'' for the saprophytic members of ''Amanita'' (''sensu largo'') but the new name ''Saproamanita thiersii'' is very controversial and not broadly accepted.<ref name=\"urlFungorum\"/><ref name=Redheadetal2016/><ref name=tulloss2/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Amanita thiersii 258501.jpg|280px|thumb|left|Stipe and cap of the mushroom]]\nThe cap is white and dry, measuring {{convert|35|\u2013|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide, and convex in shape (conico- or plano-convex). It often has a broad low [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The cap's [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] may be {{convert|10|mm|1|abbr=on}} thick. At first the cap is covered by the soft, white fragmentary remains of the [[universal veil]], which become more widely separated as the cap expands. They are shaggy and somewhat sticky.<ref name=\"tulloss1\" /><ref name=\"meyers\"/>\n\nThe [[Gill (mycology)|gills]] are of varying lengths. They are free from the stipe and vary from crowded to widely spaced. They may be narrow or broad and are white to creamy yellow in color. The stipe is white and is {{convert|80|-|200|mm|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|-|20|mm|1|abbr=on}} wide. In some specimens, the stipe bruises to a yellow color. It is either hollow or lightly stuffed with a cottony tissue.<ref name=bas/> The bulb at the base is slightly broader than the rest of the stipe. The bulb is {{convert|25|mm|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|22|mm|1|abbr=on}} wide. A shaggy, drooping [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] is present which is often shed before maturity.<ref name=\"tulloss1\" />\n\nSpores of ''S.&nbsp;thiersii'' are white and roughly spherical. They measure approximately 7.8 \u2013 9.8 by 7.3 \u2013 9.0&nbsp;\u00b5m and are [[Amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]].<ref name=\"tulloss1\" /> In an analysis, both monokaryotic (one nucleus per cell) and [[dikaryon|dikaryotic]] (two nuclei per cell) strains were isolated from fruit bodies. All the spores were found to be [[binucleated cells|binucleate]] but the researchers believed that in the monokaryotic strain, the second nucleus had failed to pass through the [[germ tube]].<ref name=wolfe/>\n\nThe odor of this mushroom is indistinct but with age can become unpleasant, like that of decay or cheese. The fungus is said to taste oily bitter<ref name=jenkins/> or bitter metallic.<ref name=\"tulloss1\" />\n\n===Identification===\n\n''S.&nbsp;thiersii'' may be gathered inadvertently and thought to be edible due to the fact that it grows on lawns among grasses. This is in contrast to ''Amanita'' species which grow around trees and are thus usually seen in forests. It can be distinguished from other white fungi growing in grassland by its fluffy cap, though the white veil fragments may eventually get washed away by rain.<ref name=McFarland/>\n\nIt is similar in appearance to a number of ''Amanita'' species. It can be distinguished from ''[[Amanita praegraveolens|A.&nbsp;praegraveolens]]'' microscopically by the absence of [[clamp connection]]s between the cells in ''S.&nbsp;thiersii''.<ref name=smith/> Both ''S.&nbsp;thiersii'' and ''A.&nbsp;aureofloccosa'' have hollow stems but the latter has a more tapering stipe and the whole fruit body is yellower.<ref name=bas/><ref name=amanitaceae1/> ''[[Amanita silvifuga|A.&nbsp;silvifuga]]'' is another species that grows in similar locations in grassland in Texas and H. D. Thiers described the taste of both it and ''A. thiersii'' as being bitter. It can be distinguished by its darker coloration and more warted appearance.<ref name=bas/><ref name=amanitaceae2/>\n\n==Toxicity==\nThe species is suspected of being [[Mushroom poisoning|toxic]] as is the case in most of its close relatives. Handling the mushroom is harmless; poisoning occurs only on ingestion.<ref name=McFarland/> A case of poisoning that may have been caused by ''S.&nbsp;thiersii'' has been reported from the state of [[Puebla|Puebla, Mexico]]. The outcome of this case is unknown. Symptoms of poisoning in humans include reversible impairment of kidney function. A [[Wieland Test#Meixner test for amatoxins|Meixner test]] revealed that [[amatoxin]]s were not involved in the Puebla case.<ref name=\"tulloss1\" /><ref name=McFarland/>\n\n==Ecology and habitat==\n[[Image:Amanita thiersii 260826.jpg|thumb|right|A specimen of ''S.&nbsp;thiersii'']]\n\n''Saproamanita thiersii'' inhabits lawns, pastures and prairies throughout the [[Mississippi river basin#Watershed|Mississippi River Basin]]. It often forms [[fairy ring]]s<ref name=horn/> or arcs but also sometimes fruits as isolated specimens. It has been found growing in the same lawn as ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]''.<ref name=\"meyers\"/> Analysis using stable [[Isotopes of carbon|carbon isotopes]] has proved that this mushroom is [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]] in nature, unlike the other [[mycorrhizal]] ''Amanitas''.<ref name=wolfe/><ref name=kuobook/>\n\nThe [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruit bodies]] of ''S.&nbsp;thiersii'' grow during the mid or late summer until early fall.<ref name=McFarland/> Since it was first reported in 1952 in Texas, this species has been expanding its range. It appeared in southern Illinois in the 1990s and has since spread to central Illinois, where it is the most common mushroom found in lawns during July and August.<ref name=KuoM1/> Today it occurs in nine states including Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio, Kansas and Illinois.<ref name=wolfe/> It also occurs in Mexico.<ref name=\"tulloss1\" />\n\n==Genome project==\n\nThe main source from which ''S.&nbsp;thiersii'' derives its carbon is the [[cellulose]] of the decomposing plant material found in its grassland habitat.<ref name=wolfe/> The [[enzyme]]s that degrade cellulose are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the enzymes used by [[Mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] fungi that have symbiotic associations with plant roots. In an attempt to identify the genes involved in these processes, researchers at the [[United States Department of Energy]] and [[University of Wisconsin]] are jointly working to sequence the ''S. thiersii'' [[genome]] and to compare it with that of ''[[Amanita bisporigera]]'', a species which forms [[mycorrhizal]] relationships with tree<ref name=KuoM2/> and which has already been partly sequenced. They hope to better understand the genetic pathways involved in the evolution of ectomycorrhizal associations. Another research objective is to establish whether the enzymes used by ''S. thiersii'' to degrade cellulose can be cost-effectively used in the conversion of crop residues into [[biofuel]]s. ''S.&nbsp;thiersii'' seems to be expanding its range northwards and its genome may provide clues as to how it is adapting to climate change and further information on mycorrhizal relationships.<ref name=\"urlDJGI\"/>\n\nThis research has shown that there was a single origin of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the genus ''Amanita''. DNA analysis has shown that a group of species in the subsection ''Vittadiniae'' (which includes ''S.&nbsp;thiersii'') has few derived characteristics. This [[clade]] has a single ancestor (or a very small number) and seems to have come into being at a very early stage in the evolution of the genus.<ref name=\"tulloss1\" /><ref name=\"University of Wisconsin\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n\n* [[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=amanitaceae1>{{cite web |url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+aureofloccosa |title=''Amanita aureofloccosa'' |publisher=Amanitaceae.org |accessdate=2012-12-01}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=amanitaceae2>{{cite web |url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+silvifuga |title=''Amanita silvifuga '' |publisher=Amanitaceae.org |accessdate=2012-12-01}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=bas>{{cite book |last=Bas |first=C. |title=Morphology and Subdivision of ''Amanita'' and a Monograph on its Section ''Lepidella'' |year=1969 |series=Persoonia |volume=5 |issue=4 |publisher=Rijksherbarium |pages=334, 384|oclc=15235038}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"University of Wisconsin\">{{cite web |last=Wolfe |first=B. |title=''Amanita thiersii'' genome project |url=http://www.botany.wisc.edu/pringlelab/amanita/amanitaproject.html|work=Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin - Madison|publisher=Pringle Laboratory|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=horn>{{cite book|last=Horn|first=B.|title=A Guide to Kansas Mushrooms|year=1993|publisher=University Press of Kansas|author2=Kay, R.|author3= Abel, D.|page=93|isbn=978-0-7006-0570-5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=jenkins>{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=D.

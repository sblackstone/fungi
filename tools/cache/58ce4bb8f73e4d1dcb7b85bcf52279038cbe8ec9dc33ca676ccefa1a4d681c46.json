The name supersedes ''Agaricus rodmani''. It is also commonly known as '''torq''', the '''banded agaric''', '''spring agaric''', or '''pavement mushroom''', as it has been recorded pushing up paving slabs.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''bitorquis'' is [[Latin]] \"having two collars\", and refers to the two rings resulting from detachment of the [[ring (mycology)|annulus]] from both the top and bottom of the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]].\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is dry, smooth, and white (but staining yellowish in age), and measures 4 to 15&nbsp;cm in diameter, convex to flat;  often with dirt on the cap.\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free, very narrow, close, light pink color when young, becoming dark reddish-brown as the spores mature. <ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ediblewildfood.com/sidewalk-mushroom.aspx |website=Sidewalk Mushroom, Agaricus bitorquis, Ediblewildfood.com |accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref> The [[spore print]] is chocolate brown. The stipe is 3 \u2013 11&nbsp;cm long, 2 \u2013 4&nbsp;cm thick, cylindrical to clavate (club-shaped), equal to enlarged at the base, stout, white, smooth, with a membranous veil and thick white mycelial sheathing near the base. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is solid and firm, with a mild odor. It is often confused with ''[[Agaricus bernardii]]''; however, that mushroom has a salty odor.\n\n===Microscopic details===\n{{mycomorphbox\n| name = ''Agaricus bitorquis''\n| whichGills = free\n| capShape = convex\n| capShape2 = flat\n| hymeniumType = gills\n| stipeCharacter = ring\n| ecologicalType = saprotrophic\n| sporePrintColor = brown\n| howEdible = choice\n}}\n[[File:Agaricus in concrete.jpg|thumb|''Agaricus bitorquis'' mushroom emerging through [[asphalt concrete]] in summer.]]\n[[Basidiospore]]s are elliptical in shape, smooth, and with dimensions of 5\u20137 x 4\u20135.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]].

Specimens collected in the wild may be gritty due to its often subterranean habitat. As with all specimens picked from the wild, care should be taken to consider the suitability of the collection site, as this species can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals, especially lead, from polluted areas.<ref>Cocchia, L., Vescovia, L., Petrinid, L.E, Petrini, O.

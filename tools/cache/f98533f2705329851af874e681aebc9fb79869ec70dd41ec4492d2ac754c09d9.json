Originally  mistaken for ''Psilocybe caerulescens'' var. ''caerulescens'', it is named after [[Andrew Weil]], the integrative medicine physician.\n\n== Description ==\n''Psilocybe weilii'' has a [[farinaceous]] taste and a farinaceous smell similar to a [[cucumber]].\n''Psilocybe weilii'' [[pleurocystidia]] are [[wikt:fusoid|subfusoid]] to [[sublageniform]], and are 16 to 22 [[\u00b5m]] by 5 to 10&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[cheilocystidia]] are long-necked, [[wikt:lageniform|lageniform]], sometimes forked, and are 20 to 38&nbsp;\u00b5m by 5 to 7&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=\"Guzmanetal1997\">{{Cite journal \n| first1 = Gast\u00f3n | last1 = Guzm\u00e1n\n| first2 = Fidel | last2 = Tapia\n| first3 = Paul | last3 = Stamets\n| title = A new bluing ''Psilocybe'' from U.S.A.\n| journal = Mycotaxon\n| volume = 65 <!-- LXV -->\n| pages = 191\u2013195\n|date=October\u2013December 1997\n| url = http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0065/0191.htm\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Cap ===\n''Psilocybe weilii'' [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]]s range from (2)3 to 6(8.5) cm in diameter and are obtusely [[conic]] to [[wikt:convex|convex]] to [[wikt:campanulate|campanulate]]. The margin is incurved or inrolled when young, becoming irregularly [[wikt:lobulated|lobulated]] then straight with age. ''Psilocybe weilii'' are [[wikt:subumbonate|subumbonate]], [[hygrophanous]], [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]], and [[wikt:viscid|subviscid]] when moist from the separable gelatinous [[Pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]]. It is translucent-striate at the margin, and purple brown or chestnut brown to dark brown, fading to buff or straw yellow as it dries, with the center remaining blackish brown. ''Psilocybe weilii'' often have white scale-like remnants along the margin. The mushroom flesh is white, bruising a strong blue, with some specimens becoming completely blue-black.\n\n=== Gills ===\n[[Lamella (mycology)|Gills]] can be [[wikt:subadnate|subadnate]] to [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]], and are closely aligned. They are cream to light brown or brownish-yellow, becoming purple brown as the spores mature. The edges are hairy, with small tufts (sub floccose) and whitish.\n\n=== Spores ===\n[[Spore]]s of this mushroom are dark violet brown, subrhomboid to subellipsoid, and are (5.5)6 to 7(7.5) [[\u00b5m]] by 5 to 6(6.5) \u00b5m. They are thick-walled with broad [[germ pore]]s.\n\n=== Stipe ===\nThe [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] or stalk is (2.5)4 to 7&nbsp;cm long and (4)5 to 10&nbsp;mm thick. It has an equal structure, and is slightly [[wikt:subulbous|subulbous]]. It is hollow, and whitish to yellowish becoming bluish black and drying to grayish straw with vinaceous ([[maroon]]) tones. Whitish, woolly ([[wikt:floccose|subfloccose]]) patches are located near the base. The stipe is pruinose (powdery) or smooth towards the upper region. The [[Veil (botany)|velum]]<!-- is well-formed,? --> sometimes leaves a partial annular (ringed) zone. It bruises bluish to blackish when injured, sometimes with the entire stipe completely blue or with vinaceous tones.\n\n== Habitat and formation ==\n''Psilocybe weilii'' grows [[wikt:gregarious|gregariously]] to [[wikt:cespitose|cespitosely]], from May to December. ''Psilocybe weilii'' is found under [[Loblolly Pine]] and [[Sweet Gum]] or in [[bermuda grass]] or [[fescue]], often in red clay soil that is enriched with pine needles. It also grows in urban lawns and in the deep woods on areas where decaying wood collects. <!-- There is often a smaller fruiting in spring.--> ''Psilocybe weilii'' is found only in northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref name=\"Guzmanetal1997\" />\nLocal studies have shown a correlation between the growth of Psilocybe Weilii above the ground that leaking sewage pipes are buried under. In one instance, in Suwanee, Georgia, a clearing that was roughly 1/4 mile in length was found with thousands of fruiting Psilocybe Weilii, many of which were 5\" in diameter. This discovery was found in late September 2003. After the city of Suwanee found the leak in the sewage pipes, and corrected the problem, the Psilocybe Weilii were never found again in that specific location.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Psilocybe weilii stemandgills.jpg| ''Psilocybe weilii'' stem and gills.\nImage:Psilocybe weilii in habitat.jpg| ''Psilocybe weilii'' in habitat.\nImage:Psilocybe weilii.jpg|'' Large Psilocybe weilii''\n\nImage:Psilocybe weilii 2.jpg| ''Psilocybe weilii''\nImage:Psilocybe weilii 3.jpg| ''Psilocybe weilii''\nImage:Psilocybe weilii 4.jpg| ''Psilocybe weilii''\nImage:Psilocybeweiliirobbybertocreavitecommon.jpg| ''Psilocybe weilii''\nImage:Psilocybe weilii gills.jpg| Psilocybe weilii gills\nImage:Map of Georgia elevations.png| A map of Georgia's elevations\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Psilocybe weilii}}\n* [http://www.erowid.org/plants/show_image.php?i=mushrooms/psilocybe_weilii4.jpg ''Psilocybe weilii'' photo] and [http://www.erowid.org/plants/show_image.php?i=mushrooms/psilocybe_weilii2.jpg ''Psilocybe weilii'' photo \u2013 cap underside]\n* [https://mushroomobserver.org/observer/observation_search?pattern=Psilocybe+weilii ''Psilocybe weilli'' (www.mushroomobserver.org)]\n* [http://www.shroomery.org The Shroomery: contains knowledge contributed by individuals in the Hunting Forums.]\n* [http://www.stainblue.com/andrewweil.html Visionary Mushrooms: ''Psilocybe weilii'']\n\n{{Psilocybe mushrooms}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q7255958}}\n\n[[Category:Psychoactive fungi]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic tryptamine carriers]]\n[[Category:Psilocybe|weilii]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Entheogens]]"}]}}}}

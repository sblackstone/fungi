Most of the genus are excellent edibles, only a few are not, and this is one of the species that can leave some people with somewhat severe gastro-intestinal upsets.<ref name=T.Laessoe/> It appears occasionally in most kinds of woodland, during late summer, in northern [[temperate zones]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFor many years '''''Agaricus moelleri''''' was erroneously accredited with the binomial ''Agaricus placomyces'' by some British authors. The [[specific name (botany)|epithet]] ''placomyces''  was in fact given to a North American species of ''Agaricus'' by [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1878 (now known as ''Agaricus praeclaresquamosus'' A.E.Freeman 1979).[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720010711/http://www.basidiochecklist.info/DisplayResults.asp?intGBNum=40287]  The current binomial ''Agaricus moelleri'' was published in 1976 by the Ukrainian mycologist [[Solomon P. Wasser]].<ref name=Wasser1976>{{cite journal |author=Wasser SP. |title=Species nova e genere ''Agaricus'' L. ex Fr. emnd. Karst. |journal=Novosti Sistematiki Nizshikh Rastenii |year=1976 |volume=13 |pages=77\u20139}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] has a greyish-brown patch in the centre and cold grey-brown scaling on the surrounding off-white background. It is {{convert|5|to|9|cm|in}} in diameter, and yellows when bruised. It is ovate when young, flattening later.<ref name=Phillips06/> The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] has a drooping [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], and stains yellow very easily when bruised, this colour then changes to brown over time. The stem [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] bruises yellow only faintly, and is more noticeable in the base. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded, and free, as is typical for an ''Agaricus''. They are pink on young specimens, but brown to black on older fruit bodies. The flesh is white and does not change colour on cutting. It is noted by some authors as smelling like ink, iodoform, sweat, or mouldy straw. The [[spore]]s are 4\u20136 x 3\u20134&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]], and are elliptical.\n\nA similar species occurring in North America, ''Agaricus praeclaresquamosus'' A.E. Freeman 1979, has several variants, some of which are larger.<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\nThe rare ''[[Agaricus phaeolepidotus]]'' also has the iodoform, or ink smell, but has browner cap scales, and stains yellow less readily.<ref name=T.Laessoe/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Agaricus moelleri'' is found in the [[temperate zones]] of the [[northern hemisphere]]. North America, Britain, and Europe, growing in mixed forests and woods. It is widespread, but can be locally rare, and favors rich alkaline woodland, or parkland.<ref name=T.Laessoe/>\n\n==Edibility==\nIn the same fashion as '''the yellow stainer''' (''[[Agaricus xanthodermus]]''), ''Agaricus moelleri'' can produce nasty gastro intestinal symptoms for some people but not others, when ingested.<ref name=T.Laessoe/> It may be best to presume they are poisonous overall.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Agaricus species|List of ''Agaricus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.english-country-garden.com/fungus/inky-mushroom.htm English Country Garden]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1614842}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Agaricus Moelleri}}\n[[Category:Agaricus|moelleri]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1976]]"}]}}}}

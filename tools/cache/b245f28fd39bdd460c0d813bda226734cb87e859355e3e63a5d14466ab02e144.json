It is often found growing in small groups on wood debris, or in leaf litter, during summer and autumn in Europe, Asia, and eastern North America. It is not generally considered [[edible mushroom|edible]], although there are reports of the immature 'eggs' being consumed.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus name ''Mutinus'' was a phallic deity, [[Priapus|Mutinus Mutunus]] (known to the Greeks as [[Priapus]]), one of the Roman ''[[di indigetes]]'' placated by Roman brides,<ref name=Arora1986/>  and ''caninus'' means \"dog-like\" in [[Latin]].<ref name=Simpson1979/> ''Mutinus'' is the [[diminutive]] of ''muto'', a [[Classical Latin|Latin]] word for [[Penis]]. It was described initially by [[William Hudson (botanist)|William Hudson]] (1730\u20131793), a noted British botanist. Its common names in French, ''Phallus de Chien'', ''Satyre des chiens'', also hint at its resemblance to a [[dog penis]]. It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"dog stinkhorn\".<ref name=BritishNames/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mutinus caninus 14164.jpg|thumb|left|Cross section of the immature 'egg']]\nThis small member of the [[Phallaceae]] family emerges from an off-white egg-like fruiting body that lies half buried in leaf litter on the woodland floor. White [[mycelial cord]]s (rhizomorphs), are often visible beneath this 'egg', which is {{convert|2|\u2013|4|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} high, and {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=Laessoe1998/> The 'egg' has a tough outer skin (peridium), which covers a gelatinous inner layer, which in turn protects the fully formed, but unexpanded fruiting body. When the \u2018egg\u2019 splits open the fungus expands rapidly (usually within a few hours), to its full height of {{convert|10|\u2013|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. It is around {{convert|1|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} thick, and is either yellowish-white, yellow, or pale orange. The split egg is retained as a volva-like sack, at the base. The column is very fragile, pitted, and cylindrical. It has a pointed tip, and is usually curved. The tip is covered in the [[spore]] bearing matter ([[gleba]]) which is a dark olive-brown paste, and has a smell which is irresistible to insects. (These insects help distribute the spores on their bodies, and in their stomachs.) Beneath the spore mass the tip is dark orange. Although its smell is not as strong as the related common stinkhorn (''[[Phallus impudicus]]''), it has been described as smelling like cat faeces.<ref name=Zeitl976/>\n\nAmerican mycologist [[Sanford Myron Zeller]] described an albino form of the fungus based on collections made in [[Warrengon, Oregon]]. It is essentially identical to the regular form but pure white throughout, except for the gleba.<ref name=Zeller1944/> This form, named ''M.&nbsp;caninus'' var. ''albus'', was first mentioned in the scientific literature by [[Edward Angus Burt]] in 1896.<ref name=Burt1896/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Mutinus ravenelii]]'' is pinker in coloration, with a red tip. It is a rarer American species, now spreading in [[Europe]].<ref name=Laessoe1998/>  Another North American species ''[[Mutinus elegans]]'' is very similar to ''M.&nbsp;ravenelii'', and is short and stocky, with a more pointed apex.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe dog stinkhorn is found occasionally, and is quite common in [[Europe]], [[British Islands|Britain]], and Eastern [[North America]].<ref name=Arora1986/> The fungus is listed in the [[Regional Red List|red data list]] of the Ukraine.<ref name=Sarkina2003/> A collection from the [[Canary Islands]] was noted as the southernmost collection for the species in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=Beltran1998/> It has also been collected in Iran,<ref name=Saber1986/> Turkey,<ref name=Demirel2004/> and China, including [[Hebei]], [[Jilin]], and [[Guangdong]].<ref name=Zhishu1993/> It appears from summer to late autumn, and is usually found in small groups; in leaf litter; on wood debris, or wooded roadsides. It may occur in both [[deciduous]], and [[coniferous]] woods. The fruit bodies of the fungus can serve as a food source for [[thief ants]] and developing blow flies (''[[Phormia regina]]'').<ref name=Stoffolano1990/>\n\n==Edibility==\nThe dog stinkhorn is probably [[edible mushroom|edible]] at the \u2018egg\u2019 stage, but it is not recommended. At least one report from in the eastern United States strongly recommends the 'eggs' peeled and fried as a tasty dish.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nMutinus caninus 18.jpg\nMutinus caninus 12.jpg\nGemeine Hundsrute Mutinus caninus.JPG\nMutinus caninus 13.jpg\nMutinus caninus 15.jpg\nMutinus caninus in UK.JPG\nMutinus caninus 16.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora, David |authorlink=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |page=771 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Beltran1998>{{cite journal |author1=Beltr\u00e1n Tejera, E. |author2=Ba\u00f1ares Baudet, A. |author3=Rodr\u00edguez-Armas, J.L. |title=Gasteromycetes on the Canary Islands: Some noteworthy new records |journal=Mycotaxon |year=1998 |volume=67 |pages=439\u201353 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0067/0439.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Burt1896>{{cite journal |author=Burt, Edward A. |title=The development of ''Mutinus caninus'' (Huds.), Fr. |journal=Annals of Botany |year=1896 |volume=10 |pages=343\u201372 |url=https://archive.org/stream/annalsbotany09progoog#page/n420/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BritishNames>{{cite web |url=http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/ENGLISH_NAMES.pdf |title=Recommended English Names for Fungi in the UK |format=PDF |publisher=[[British Mycological Society]] |page=29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716083053/http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/ENGLISH_NAMES.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Demirel2004>{{cite journal|vauthors=Demirel K, Uzun Y |title=Two new records of Phallales for the mycoflora of Turkey |journal=Turkish Journal of Botany |year=2004 |volume=28 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=213\u201314 |issn=1300-008X |url=http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/botany/issues/bot-04-28-1-2/bot-28-1-2-22-0207-3.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Laessoe1998>{{cite book |author=Laess\u00f8e, Thomas |year=1998 |title=Mushrooms |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=London, UK |isbn=0-7513-1070-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Saber1986>{{cite journal |author=Saber, M. |title=Contribution to the knowledge of Gasteromycetes collected in Iran |journal=Iranian Journal of Plant Pathology |year=1986 |volume=22 |issue=1\u20134 |pages=25\u201338}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Sarkina2003>{{cite journal |author1=Sarkina, I.S. |author2=Prydiuk, M.P. |author3=Heluta, V.P. |title=Macromycetes of Crimea, listed in the red data book of Ukraine |journal=Ukrayins'kyi Botanichnyi Zhurnal |year=2003 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=438 46 |issn=0372-4123 |language=Ukrainian}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Simpson1979>{{cite book |author=Simpson, D.P. |title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary |publisher=Cassell Ltd |year=1979 |edition=5 |location=London, UK |page=883 |isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Stoffolano1990>{{cite journal |author1=Stoffolano, J.G. |author2=Zou, B.X. |author3=Yin, C.M. |title=The stinkhorn fungus, ''Mutinus caninus'', as a potential food for egg development in the blowfly, ''Phormia regina'' |journal=Entomologia Experimentalis Et Applicata |year=1990 |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=267\u201373 |issn=0013-8703 |doi=10.1111/j.1570-7458.1990.tb01371.x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zeitl976>{{cite book |author=Zeitlmayr, Linus |year=1976 |title=Wild Mushrooms: An Illustrated Handbook |publisher=Garden City Press |location=Hertfordshire, UK |isbn=0-584-10324-7 |page=114}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zeller1944>{{cite journal |author=Zeller, Sanford Myron |title=A white variety of ''Mutinus caninus'' |journal=Mycologia |year=1944 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=263\u201365 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0036/003/0263.htm |doi=10.2307/3754822}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zhishu1993>{{cite book |vauthors=Zhishu B, Zheng G, Taihui L |title=The Macrofungus Flora of China's Guangdong Province (Chinese University Press) |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York, New York |year=1993 |pages=545\u201346 |isbn=962-201-556-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0cAered-vqYC&pg=PA545}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1500672}}\n\n[[Category:Phallales]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1778]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]"}]}}}}

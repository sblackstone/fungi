Though considered a [[little brown mushroom]] of unknown [[edible mushroom|edibility]], it is distinctive because of its thick covering of coarse hairs, and differentiated from other members of ''[[Crinipellis]]'' by its slightly larger [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] size, which reaches up to {{convert|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are crowded closely together, and are free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. [[Saprobic]], it grows on the dead wood of [[deciduous]] trees from late summer to autumn. The fungus is found commonly in eastern North America, but has also been collected in Portugal and Korea. The [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''C.&nbsp;zonata'' var. ''cremoricolor'', found in eastern North America, may be distinguished microscopically by its longer [[spore]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\nThe species was first named as ''Agaricus zonatus'' by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1872, based on specimens found near [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=\"Peck 1872\"/> He later transferred it to the genus ''[[Collybia]]'' in 1896.<ref name=\"Peck 1896\"/> It was given its current name by the Italian botanist [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]].<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Crinipellis zonata\"/>\n\n''Crinipellis zonata'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in subsection ''Crinipellis'' of [[section (biology)|section]] ''Crinipellis'' in the genus ''[[Crinipellis]]'', according to [[Rolf Singer]]'s 1986 arrangement of the [[Agaricales]]. Species in this subsection have elongated spores, and typically lack [[cystidia]] on the sides of [[lamella (mycology)|gills]].<ref name=\"Singer 1986\"/> A 2009 [[phylogenetic]] analysis of several ''Crinipellis'' and ''[[Moniliophthora]]'' species (''Moniliophthora'' are [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorphic]] fungi parasitic on [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] and previously included in  ''Crinipellis''<ref name=\"Aime 2005\"/>) demonstrated that ''C.&nbsp;zonata'' formed a [[clade]] with ''[[Crinipellis rhizomaticola|C.&nbsp;rhizomaticola]]'', ''[[Crinipellis scabella|C.&nbsp;scabella]]'', and ''[[Crinipellis nigricaulis|C.&nbsp;nigricaulis]]''. The conclusions of this analysis, based on the [[DNA sequence]]s of [[ribosomal DNA]] coding for [[internal transcribed spacer]]s, are inconsistent with the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]-based classification given by Singer.<ref name=\"Antonin 2009\"/>\n\nThe mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"zoned Crinipellis\" or the \"zoned-cap Collybia\".<ref name=\"Emberger\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Crinipellis zonata 48669.jpg|thumb|left|Fruit bodies can grow in small clusters on decaying hardwood.]]\n''Crinipellis zonata'' is a [[little brown mushroom]] with a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of {{convert|1|to|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, which is convex (sometimes approaching flat) in shape. Typically, it has a small, distinctive depression in the centre, while the whole cap is densely hairy and dry. There are often concentric zones of both color and texture.<ref name=\"Kuo\"/> The cap is tawny or cream, while the hairs (which are set in lines) are tawny. The white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are close and narrow, and free or nearly free from the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The gills do not discolor.<ref name=\"Kuo\"/> The stem is between {{convert|25|and|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in height, by {{convert|1|to|2|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick. Like the cap, it is densely covered in tawny hairs. Although the stem is hollow,<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> the cap has an insubstantial layer of white flesh.<ref name=\"Kuo\"/>\n\nThe [[spore print]] is white, and the smooth, elliptical [[spore]]s are 4\u20136 by 3\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m in size.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 25\u201330 by 6.0\u20136.5&nbsp;\u00b5m. ''C.&nbsp;zonata'' has ''basidioles''\u2014basidium-like cells in the [[hymenium]] that lack the slender projections known as ''[[sterigmata]]'' that attach to spores. The basidioles are 15\u201328 by 3.0\u20138.0&nbsp;\u00b5m, and range in shape from club-shaped to cylindrical to fusoid (fuse-like). The cheilocystidia ([[cystidium|cystidia]] found on the edges of gills) are 20\u201345 by 5.0\u20139.0&nbsp;\u00b5m, cylindrical, club-shaped or fusoid, irregular, and branched or coral-like. Pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the gill face) are absent. The \"hairs\" on the cap surface are about 50\u2013800 by 4.0\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m, and roughly cylindrical with an irregular base; the hairs on the stem are similar to the cap hairs.<ref name=\"Antonin 2009\"/> The cap and stem hairs are ''dextrinoid'', meaning that they are [[staining|stained]] yellowish-brown or reddish-brown by the [[iodine]] of [[Melzer's reagent]].<ref name=\"Miller 2006\"/> [[Clamp connection]]s are present in all tissues.<ref name=\"Antonin 2009\"/>\n\n===Variety ''cremoricolor''===\nIn 1989, Scott Redhead reduced the species ''Crinipellis cremoricolor'' (originally described by Robert L. Shaffer and Margaret G. Weaver in 1965, based on specimens found near the [[University of Michigan Biological Station]]<ref name=\"Shaffer 1965\"/>) to a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''C.&nbsp;crinipellis''.<ref name=\"Redhead 1989\"/> The variety ''cremoricolor'' is found in eastern North America and has longer spores than the nominate variety, measuring 7\u201312 by 3.8\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=\"Miller 2006\"/> According to Shaffer and Weaver, it differs macroscopically from the typical variety in having cream- to [[buff (color)|buff]]-colored cap and stem, and pale pinkish-cinnamon gills.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1965\"/>\n\n===Edibility===\nFruit bodies of ''Crinipellis zonata'' have no distinct odor, and a mild to slightly mealy taste.<ref name=\"Kuo\"/> Though the [[edible mushroom|edibility]] is not known with certainty, author Roger Phillips lists the species as \"Poisonous/Suspect\".<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nThough similar in appearance to other members of ''[[Crinipellis]]'', such as ''[[Crinipellis stipitaria|C.&nbsp;stipitaria]]'' and ''[[Crinipellis piceae|C.&nbsp;piceae]]'', ''C.&nbsp;zonata'' has a slightly larger cap.<ref name=\"Bessette 2007\"/><ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/> The [[Ghana]]ian species ''[[Crinipellis ghanaensis]]'' is also similar, but may be distinguished by its lighter-colored cap without a \"corrugated appearance\", and its distribution.<ref name=\"Pegler 1968\"/>\n\n==Distribution and ecology==\n''Crinipellis zonata'' is [[saprobic]],<ref name=\"Kuo\"/> living on the debris or roots of [[hardwoods]];<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> it contains wood-decaying [[enzyme]]s that can break down the [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] [[pyrene]].<ref name=\"Cernigli 1997\"/> The mushrooms grow individually or in small clusters, and can be found between August and September.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> In North America, it is distributed east of the [[Rocky Mountains]],<ref name=\"Kuo\"/> and has been recorded as far west as [[Indiana]] and [[Texas]].<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> In Europe, it has been collected in Portugal.<ref name=\"Antonin 1997\"/> It has also been collected in South Korea.<ref name=\"Antonin 2009\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Aime 2005\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Aime MC, Phillips-Mora W |year=2005 |title=The causal agents of witches' broom and frosty pod rot of cacao (chocolate, ''Theobroma cacao'') form a new lineage of Marasmiaceae |journal=Mycologia |pmid=16596953 |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=1012\u20131022 |jstor=3762281 |doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.5.1012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Antonin 1997\">{{cite book |vauthors=Anton\u00edn V, Nordeloos ME |year=1997 |title=A monograph of ''Marasmius'', ''Collybia'' and related genera in Europe.

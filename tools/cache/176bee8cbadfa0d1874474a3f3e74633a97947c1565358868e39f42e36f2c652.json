It is a common species found in Europe and North America, where it grows as a [[saprophyte]] in meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. ''S.&nbsp;caerulea'' was officially [[species description|described]] to science in 1979, although it was known to be a distinct species for about two centuries before that. The [[taxon]] ''Stropharia cyanea'', as defined by [[Risto Tuomikoski]] in 1953, and used by several later authors, is a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] of ''S.&nbsp;caerulea''.\n\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) of ''Stropharia caerulea'' feature a greenish-blue [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] sparsely covered in white flecks of [[partial veil|veil]] at the margin, and a sticky, glutinous surface texture. [[Lamella (mycology)|Gills]] on the cap underside have an adnate or sinuate attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. They are initially pale purplish-brown, becoming darker brown in age as the spores mature. The greenish stipe is covered in white scales up to a thin, transient [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. It is similar in appearance to its less common relative ''[[Stropharia aeruginosa]]'', but that species has a more robust ring on its stipe, more scales on the cap, and darker gills with white edges.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIn 1953, the Finnish scientist [[Risto Tuomikoski]] observed that the well-known ''[[Stropharia aeruginosa]]'' had a lookalike species that was characterized by a brown [[spore print]], an indistinct, temporary ring on the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and chrysocystidia{{#tag:ref|Chrysocystidia are [[cystidia]] whose contents contain a yellow [[cytoplasmic inclusion|inclusion]] that becomes more deeply yellow when exposed to [[ammonia]] or other alkaline compounds. They are characteristic of the genus ''[[Stropharia]]''.<ref name=\"Ulloa 2014\"/>|group=nb}} lining the gill edges. Tuomikoski called this lookalike ''Stropharia cyanea'', a name he based on [[James Bolton]]'s 1820 taxon ''Agaricus cyaneus''. Later researchers confirmed the existence and widespread European distribution of this [[taxon]]. Tuomikoski's use of the name ''S.&nbsp;cyanea'', however, was incorrect as Bolton's type refers to the purple-brown spored species ''S.&nbsp;aeruginosa''.<ref name=\"Kreisel 1979\"/> Despite this, the misapplied name ''S.&nbsp;cyanea'' has persisted in some contemporary [[field guide]]s.<ref name=\"Bas 1999\"/>{{#tag:ref|Examples include ''Mushrooms'' by Thomas Laessoe (2002),<ref name=\"Laessoe 2002\"/> and ''Mushrooms and Other Fungi'' by Roger Phillips (2013).<ref name=\"Phillips 2013\"/>|group=nb}}\n\n''Stropharia caerulea'' was first mentioned in the scientific literature by James Bolton in 1788, under the name ''Agaricus politus''. This usage is not considered [[validly published name (botany)|valid]] according to [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|nomenclatural rules]], because it was used by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] to refer to [[Entoloma politum|another species]] in his 1801 ''Synopsis methodica fungorum'', which is a [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] work.<ref name=\"urlFungorum: Agaricus politus\"/> ''Stropharia caerulea'' was officially [[species description|described]] by mycologist [[Hanns Kreisel]] in 1979 from collections made near [[Woldegk]], Germany.<ref name=\"Kreisel 1979\"/> [[Machiel Noordeloos]] transferred the species to ''[[Psilocybe]]'' in 1995,<ref name=\"Noordeloos 1995\"/> but today this genus is mostly reserved for species that contain the [[psychoactive]] compounds [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]].<ref name=\"Norvell 2010\"/> Although psilocybin had once been reported from ''S.&nbsp;caerulea'',<ref name=\"Margot 1981\"/> subsequent analyses have not revealed any traces of the substance in the fruit bodies.<ref name=\"Bresinsky 1990\"/>\n\nThe [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''caerulea'' is [[Latin]] for \"blue\".

They usually have a low, broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The colour of the cap depends on its age, ranging from pale blue-green to yellowish-bluish green. There is often a whitish zone around the margin, which invariably has bluish-green tints. When moist, the cap is sticky with a [[cap cuticle|cuticle]] that may be readily peeled; dry caps are smooth and shiny. Gills are initially pale purplish-brown, becoming darker brown in age as the spores mature. They have an [[adnation|adnate]] or [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]] attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. The stipe has a short-lived [[annulus (mycology)|annular]] (ring) zone; above this zone the stipe is smooth, while below it is fibrous and scaly. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is colourless, although it may have tinges of blue in the cap and stipe, and lacks any distinctive odour or flavour.<ref name=\"Bas 1999\"/> ''Stropharia cyanea'' fruit bodies are not [[edible mushroom|edible]].<ref name=\"Phillips 2013\"/>\n\nThe [[spore print]] is brown.<ref name=\"Kreisel 1979\"/>{{#tag:ref|In his 1979 publication, Kreisel explicitly notes the lack of purple tones in the brown spore print colour, which he states is \"a unique characteristic in the genus ''Stropharia''\".<ref name=\"Kreisel 1979\"/> However, this feature is de-emphasized by some later authors, who give the spore print colour as purple-brown.<ref name=\"Bas 1999\"/><ref name=\"Laessoe 2002\"/><ref name=\"Courtecuisse 1999\"/>|group=nb}} [[Basidiospore|Spores]] typically measure 8.0\u20139.0 by 4.0\u20135.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]], and have an [[ellipsoid]] to oblong to ovoid shape, depending on the viewing angle. [[Basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 24\u201340 by 7\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m. The cheilochrysocystidia (found on the gill edge) are club-shaped, measuring 30\u201355 by 4\u201340&nbsp;\u00b5m, with a neck that is 2\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m wide.

[[Clamp connection]]s are abundant in all tissues of ''S.&nbsp;caerulea''.<ref name=\"Bas 1999\"/> The fungus produces [[acanthocyte]]s, which are spiny cells produced on short branches on the mycelium.<ref name=\"Farr 1980\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:L\u00edmcovka m\u011bd\u011bnkov\u00e1.JPG|thumb|right|The lookalike ''S.&nbsp;aeruginosa'' has white scales around its cap margin.]]\nThere are a few greenish ''Stropharia'' with which ''S.&nbsp;caerulea'' might be confused. ''[[Stropharia pseudocyanea]]'' is an uncommon species that grows in meadows. It has a more slender form than ''S.&nbsp;caerulea'', a soft, spongy stipe, and flesh with an odour similar to fresh pepper. Microscopically, it has a dense palisade of slender, capitate (with a spherical tip) non-staining cheilocystidia on the gill edge.<ref name=\"Henrici 2002\"/> This gives the gills of young, fresh fruit bodies a whitish edge, a feature that is absent from ''S.&nbsp;caerulea''. Another lookalike, ''[[Stropharia aeruginosa|S.&nbsp;aeruginosa]]'', is less common than ''S.&nbsp;caerulea''. It is distinguished from the latter by the well-developed ring zone on its stipe, darker gills with white edges, and more numerous whitish scales around the cap margin.<ref name=\"Henrici 2002\"/><ref name=\"Kibby 2010\"/> Additionally, ''S.&nbsp;aeruginosa'' has more stable colours than ''S.&nbsp;caerulea'', the colouration of which tends to quickly wash out. However, collections of ''Stropharia'' often show characteristics that are intermediate between two or more species, making them difficult to identify accurately.<ref name=\"Trudell 2009\"/>\n\n==Habitat, distribution, and ecology==\n''Stropharia caerulea'' is a [[saprophytic]] fungus that fruits singly or in groups.<ref name=\"MushroomExpert\"/> It grows in or on meadows, roadsides, [[hedgerow]]s, gardens, and [[woodchips|woodchip]] mulch.<ref name=\"Kibby 2010\"/> In Europe it is often found in [[beech]] woods in [[soil pH|alkaline soil]].<ref name=\"Laessoe 2002\"/> It is a common species found throughout Europe, where it fruits from July to November.<ref name=\"Bas 1999\"/> Although also found in North America, generally fruiting from August to October,<ref name=\"Phillips 2013\"/> the full extent of its distribution there is unknown.<ref name=\"MushroomExpert\"/>\n\nFruitbodies of ''Stropharia caerulea'' form [[mycelial cord]]s\u2013rootlike structures consisting of a dense mass of hyphae\u2013which create extensive underground networks that move nutrients and allow the fungus to \"forage\" for resources. These cords are often associated with stems and [[rhizome]]s of the [[common nettle]] (''Urtica dioica'').<ref name=\"Donnelly 1997\"/> These mycelial systems' development and the species's interactions with other cord-forming wood decomposer basidiomycetes have been investigated. The mycelia of ''Stropharia caerulea'' form a [[fractal]] structure characterized by a dense, relatively slowly extending front, a formation associated with finding relatively homogeneously distributed nutrients\u2013equivalent to short-range foraging. An increase in the supply of soil [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]] increases the fractal branching of the mycelia, allowing increased uptake of nutrients.<ref name=\"Donnelly 1997b\"/><ref name=\"Donnelly 1998\"/><ref name=\"Donnelly 2001\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bas 1999\">{{cite book |veditors=Bas C, Kuyper TW, Noordeloos ME, Vellinga EC |author=Noordeloos ME |chapter=Family Strophariaceae |title=Flora Agaricina Neerlandica |volume=4 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSxG_rYhPMC&pg=PA55 |year=1999 |publisher=A.A.&nbsp;Balkema |location=Rotterdam |isbn=978-90-6191-860-8 |pages=55\u201356}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BMS\">{{cite web |author=Holden L. |url=http://www.britmycolsoc.org.uk/library/english-names/ |title=English names for fungi 2014 |date=July 2014 |publisher=[[British Mycological Society]] |accessdate=2015-12-11}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolton 1788\">{{cite book |author=Bolton J. |title=An History of Fungusses, Growing about Halifax |year=1788 |volume=1 |publisher=Self-published |location=Halifax/Huddersfield |at=Plate 30 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4339020#page/17/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bresinsky 1990\">{{cite book |vauthors=Bresinsky A, Besl H |title=A Colour Atlas of Poisonous Fungi: A Handbook for Pharmacists, Doctors, and Biologists |publisher=Wolfe Publishing |location=W\u00fcrzburg, Germany |year=1990 |page=118 |isbn=978-0-7234-1576-3}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Courtecuisse 1999\">{{cite book |author=Courtecuisse R. |title=Mushrooms of Britain and Europe |year=1999 |series=Collins Wildlife Trust Guides |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London, UK |page=797 |isbn=978-0-00-220012-7}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Donnelly 1997\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Donnelly DP, Boddy L |title=Resource acquisition by the mycelial-cord-former ''Stropharia caerulea'': effect of resource quantity and quality |journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology |year=1997 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=195\u2013205 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.1997.tb00402.x}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Donnelly 1997b\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Donnelly DP, Boddy L |title=Development of mycelial systems of ''Stropharia caerulea'' and ''Phanerochaete velutina'' on soil: effect of temperature and water potential |journal=Mycological Research |year=1997 |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=705\u2013713 |doi=10.1017/S0953756296003280}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Donnelly 1998\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Donelly DP, Boddy L |title=Developmental and morphological responses of mycelial systems of ''Stropharia caerulea'' and ''Phanerochaete velutina'' to soil nutrient enrichment |journal=New Phytologist |year=1998 |volume=138 |issue=3 |pages=519\u2013531 |jstor=2588348 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00117.x}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Donnelly 2001\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Donnelly DP, Boddy L |title=Mycelial dynamics during interactions between ''Stropharia caerulea'' and other cord-forming, saprotrophic basidiomycetes |journal=New Phytologist |year=2001 |volume=151 |issue=3 |pages=691\u2013704 |doi=10.1046/j.0028-646x.2001.00211.x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Farr 1980\">{{cite journal |author=Farr DA |title=The acanthocyte, a unique cell type in ''Stropharia'' (Agaricales) |journal=Mycotaxon |year=1980 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=241\u2013249 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0011/001/0241.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Henrici 2002\">{{cite journal |author=Henrici A. |title=Update on Roger Phillips' Mushrooms and other fungi of Gt.

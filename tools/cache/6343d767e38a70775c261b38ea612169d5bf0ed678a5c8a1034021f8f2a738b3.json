The mushroom itself is edible, but can absorb arsenic from the soil. Because its bright [[amethyst (color)|amethyst]] coloration fades with age and weathering, it becomes difficult to identify, hence the common name \u2018Deceiver\u2019. This common name is shared with its close relation ''[[Laccaria laccata]]'' that also fades and weathers. It is found mainly in Northern [[temperate zones]], though it is reported to occur in tropical [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] as well. Recently, some of the other species in the [[genus]] have been given the common name of \"deceiver\".\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThis species was first described in 1778 by well-known English botanist and apothecary [[William Hudson (botanist)|William Hudson]] as ''Agaricus amethystinus'', and later put into the genus ''[[Laccaria]]'' by [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]]. The amethyst deceiver has had many binomials over a great many years, but reference to the amethyst coloration is featured in most of these. It was once placed in the genus ''[[Collybia]]'', as ''Collybia amethystina'', which was probably due in part to its tough collybioid-like stem. Its present binomial places it in the genus ''Laccaria'',  with the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''amethystina'', a pairing first used by Cooke in 1884. In 1922 it was named as a variant of ''[[Laccaria laccata]]'', ''Laccaria laccata'' var. ''amethystina'' (Cooke) Rea, which is now a synonym.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Amethyst Deciever \"Laccaria amethystina\" Oct.2015, England.jpg|thumb|300px|''Laccaria amethystina'']]The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is 1&ndash;6&nbsp;cm in diameter, and is initially convex, later flattening, and often with a central depression (navel).

It grows solitary to scattered with a variety of [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] trees, with which it is [[mycorrhizal]]ly associated, though it most commonly occurs with trees in the [[Fagales]].<ref name=T.Laessoe/> It appears in late summer to early winter, and often with [[beech]];<ref name=Phillips06/> in Central and South America, it more commonly grows in association with [[oak]].<ref name=Mueller1992>Mueller, 1992.

Mueller]] described them as distinct species in 1984.<ref>Muller, 1984.</ref> '''''[[Laccaria amethysteo-occidentalis]]''''' is found in western North America, where ''L. amethystina'' does not occur. It is a very common mushroom in its geographical range.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Besides geographical difference, ''L. amethysteo-occidentalis'' differs from ''L. amethystina'' in several ways: ecologically, the former occurs only in association with [[conifers]], while the latter occurs mainly with [[hardwoods]] of the order [[Fagales]]. The sporocarp of ''L. amethysteo-occidentalis'' is on average larger than that of ''L. amethystina'', and has a deeper purple coloration, that fades to [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] rather than brownish shades. The spores are also quite distinct between the two, in that the spores of ''L. amethysteo-occidentalis'' are not as strongly globose as those of  ''L. amethystina'', being generally of a subglobose or even broadly ellipsoid shape, and additionally having much shorter spines than the spores of ''L. amethystina''.<ref name=Mueller1984b>Mueller, 1984.

''L. vinaceobrunnea'' is distinguished from ''L. amethystina'' and ''L. amethysteo-occidentalis'' macroscopically by color, with the former species having a deep purple color only in very young specimens, which soon fades to a violaceous- or reddish-brown color, and eventually to dull orange-brown or buff color with age. Its spore features are intermediate between ''L. amethystina'' and ''L. amethysteo-occidentalis'', having a subglobose to broadly ellipsoid shape like ''L. amethysteo-occidentalis'' (rather than the strongly globose shape of ''L. amethystina'' spores) and long spines characteristic of ''L. amethystina''.<ref name=Mueller1984d>Mueller, 1984.

This species is associated with ''[[Quercus]]'' and is endemic to the [[cloud forests]] of [[Central America]] and northern [[South America]] (habitats in which ''L. amethystina'' also occurs). ''L. gomezii'' is similar to ''L. vinaceobrunnea'' in a number of characteristics, but the fresh sporocarp is a darker purple than either ''L. vinaceobrunnea'' or ''L. amethystina''. Its lamellae distinguish it from other members of the ''L. amethystina'' group, with ''L. gomezii'' having attached to subdecurrant, very closely spaced lamellae, in contrast to the sinuate to arctuate, narrowly attached lamellae of other species in this group. The spores of ''L. gomezii'' are similar to those of ''L. vinaceobrunnea'' and ''Laccaria amethysteo-occidentalis'', and it lacks the distinct pileipellis hyphae of ''L. vinaceobrunnea''<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 33| pages = 223\u2013227| last = Mueller| first = Gregory M.|author2=Singer, Rolf |authorlink2=Rolf Singer | title = ''Laccaria gomezii'', a new agaric species for the querceta of Colombia and Costa Rica|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0033/0223.htm| journal = Mycotaxon| year = 1988}}</ref><ref name=Mueller1992d>Mueller, 1992.

The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have fleshy brownish-red [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, and closely spaced pinkish-yellow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick and colored similarly to the cap. The species, known only from [[California]], [[Arizona]], and Mexico, grows on the ground in leaf litter near [[oak]] trees. The fruit bodies resembles those of ''[[Lactarius rufus|L.&nbsp;rufus]]'', but ''L.&nbsp;rufulus'' tends to grow in clusters at a common base, rather than solitarily or in groups. A distinguishing microscopic characteristic is the near absence of large, spherical cells called sphaerocysts that are otherwise common in ''[[Lactarius]]'' species. ''Lactarius rufulus'' mushrooms are [[edible mushroom|edible]], and have an odor resembling [[maple syrup]]. They have been used to flavor confections and desserts.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first described by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1907, based on specimens collected at [[Stanford University]] in California.<ref name=Peck1907/> The type collections were made by A.M.&nbsp;Patterson and S.&nbsp;Nohara, botany students at the [[Leland Stanford Junior University]] who made a number of collections during the winter of 1906\u201307.<ref name=Kerrigan1979/>\n\n''Lactarius rufulus'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Thejogali'' of the [[subgenus]] Russularia of the genus ''[[Lactarius]]''. The surface characteristics of many species in section ''Thejogali'' (as defined by [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler|Hesler]] and [[Alexander H. Smith|Smith]] in 1979) are called rimulose-areolate (irregularly cracked, with the cracks crossing one another) based on a surface with \"numerous mounds of inflated cells\" paired together with crevices.<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1979, p. 25.</ref>\n\nThe mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"rufous candy cap\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lactarius rufulus edit 7959.jpg|thumb|left|The gills are subdecurrent, running slightly down the length of the stem.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''L.&nbsp;rufulus'' is {{convert|3|\u2013|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, broadly convex, becoming flattened and eventually shallowly funnel-shaped, sometimes with a slight [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The cap margin (edge) is initially curved inwards but becomes curved upward in maturity. The surface is usually uneven or wrinkled.<ref name=Arora1986/> It is brownish red at first, but fades to orange-brown with age. The attachment of the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] to the stem is [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] (squarely attached) to subdecurrent (running slightly down the length of the stem). They are packed close together, at first pinkish-yellow, but with age become a darker red or reddish brown. The gills are not forked, nor do they stain a different color when bruised. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, about {{convert|0.5|\u2013|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, nearly equal or slightly enlarged downward, dry, smooth, and reddish brown.<ref name=\"H&S pp. 512-13\"/>{{#tag:ref|Arora gives a larger maximum range for both the stem length and width\u2014{{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}, respectively.<ref name=Arora1986/>|group=nb}} It may be solid or stuffed (filled with cotton-like [[mycelia]]), but may become partially hollow with age. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm, white to pinkish-orange, and does not stain when cut. The [[latex]] is scant, white, unchanging, and does not stain tissues. Its taste is [[wikt:mild|mild]]. The [[spore print]] is white to creamy yellow.\n\nThe mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]],<ref name=Bessette2009/> with a mild taste and a slight odor of [[maple syrup]].{{#tag:ref|For reasons unexplained, several authors, including Peck,<ref name=Peck1907/> and Hesler and Smith,<ref name=\"H&S pp. 512-13\">Hesler and Smith, 1979, pp. 512\u201313.</ref> have omitted mentioning the odor of the fruit bodies.|group=nb}} American author [[David Arora]] suggests that the fruit bodies may be used in a manner similar to the [[candy cap]] mushrooms, despite being not as fragrant.<ref name=Arora1991/> Chefs in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] have been known to use it for desserts such as ice creams, cakes and caramels.<ref name=\"urlThrees a Trend: Mushroom Desserts - San Francisco Restaurants and Dining - SFoodie\"/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are 7\u20139 by 7\u20139&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]], spherical or nearly so, ornamented with a partial to complete reticulum (a system of raised, net-like ridges), with prominences up to 0.5&nbsp;\u00b5m high. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are both two- and four-spored, and measure 45\u201352 by 9\u201311&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a poorly formed layer of inflated cells with scattered filamentous pileocystidia ([[cystidium|cystidia]] on the cap).<ref name=Bessette2009/> Somewhat unusual for a ''Lactarius'', ''L.&nbsp;rufulus'' lacks or has few swollen cells (sphaerocysts) in the cap and stem.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Lactarius rubidus 317.jpg\n| width1 = 167\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Lactarius rufus11.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Lookalikes include ''L.&nbsp;rubidus'' (left) and ''L.&nbsp;rufus'' (right)\n}}\n''[[Lactarius rubidus]]'' is similar in appearance to ''L.&nbsp;rufulus'', but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or [[butterscotch]] when dried. Another lookalike is ''[[Lactarius thiersii]]'', but it has a smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. The flesh and latex of ''[[Lactarius rufus]]'' have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo.<ref name=Bessette2009/> Additionally, ''L.&nbsp;rufus'' typically grows in a caespitose manner\u2014with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base,<ref name=Peck1907/> and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than ''L.&nbsp;rufulus''.<ref name=\"urlCandy Cap - BAMS\"/> ''[[Lactarius vinaceorufescens|L.&nbsp;vinaceorufescens]]'' has a yellowing latex.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\n''Lactarius rufulus'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species, and lives in a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] association with [[oak]] species. The fungus forms an ectomycorrhizae\u2014characterized by an external sheath that surround the rootlets of the oak. The fungus receives soluble [[carbohydrate]]s that are byproducts of the plant's [[photosynthesis]], while affording the plant greater access to soil nutrients needed for growth.  The fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;rufulus'' grow scattered or in groups on the ground under oak, usually from January to March; their appearance is uncommon.<ref name=Bessette2009/> Once thought to be only in [[California]] (where they are most prevalent in the southern part of the state),<ref name=Arora1986/> they were reported from Mexico in 1998,<ref name=Montoya1998/> and from [[Arizona]] in 2006.<ref name=Bates2006/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, CA |year=1986 |page=23 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87ct90d4B9gC&lpg=PA261&dq=Lactarius%20rufulus&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q=Lactarius%20rufulus&f=false |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Arora1991>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=All that the Rain Promises and More: a Hip Pocket Guide to Western Mushrooms |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, CA |year=1991 |page=23 |isbn=0-89815-388-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87ct90d4B9gC&lpg=PA261&dq=Lactarius%20rufulus&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q=Lactarius%20rufulus&f=false |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bates2006>{{cite journal |author=Bates ST. |year=2006 |title=A preliminary checklist of Arizona macrofungi |journal=Canotia |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=47\u201378 |url=http://www.canotia.org/volumes/CANOTIA_2006_Vol2_2_Bates.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette AR, Bessette A, Harris DM |title=Milk Mushrooms of North America: A Field Guide to the Genus ''Lactarius'' |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse |year=2009 |page=235 |isbn=0-8156-3229-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kerrigan1979>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3759070 |author=Kerrigan RW. |year=1979 |title=Studies in ''Agaricus'' I.

Occurring in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[California floristic province]]s of North America, ''A. ocreata'' [[mycorrhiza|associates]] with [[oak]] trees. The large fruiting bodies (the [[mushroom]]s) generally appear in spring; the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] may be white or ochre and often develops a brownish centre, while the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] and [[volva (mycology)|volva]] are all white.\n\n''Amanita ocreata'' resemble several edible species commonly consumed by humans, increasing the risk of accidental poisoning. Mature fruiting bodies can be confused with the edible ''[[Amanita velosa|A. velosa]]'', ''[[Amanita lanei|A. lanei]]'' or ''[[Volvopluteus gloiocephalus]]'', while immature specimens may be difficult to distinguish from edible ''[[Agaricus]]'' mushrooms or puffballs. Similar in toxicity to the death cap (''[[Amanita phalloides|A. phalloides]]'') and destroying angels of Europe (''[[Amanita virosa|A. virosa]]'') and eastern North America (''[[Amanita bisporigera|A. bisporigera]]''), it is a potentially deadly fungus responsible for several poisonings in California.<ref name=\"Amth77\"/> Its principal toxic constituent, [[\u03b1-amanitin]], damages the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s, often fatally, and has no known antidote, though silybin and N-acetylcysteine show promise.<ref name=\"Enjalbert\"/> The initial symptoms are [[gastrointestinal]] and include abdominal pain, [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]]. These subside temporarily after 2\u20133&nbsp;days, though ongoing damage to internal organs during this time is common; symptoms of [[jaundice]], diarrhea, [[delirium]], seizures, and [[coma]] may follow with death from liver failure 6\u201316&nbsp;days post ingestion.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n''Amanita ocreata'' was first described by American [[mycology|mycologist]] [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1909 from material collected by [[Charles Fuller Baker]] in [[Claremont, California]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=Charles Horton|year=1909|title=New species of fungi.|journal=Bull.

The mushroom belongs to the same [[section (botany)|section]] (''Phalloideae'') and genus (''Amanita'') as several deadly poisonous fungi including the death cap (''A. phalloides'') and several all-white species of ''Amanita'' known as \"destroying angels\": ''[[Amanita bisporigera|A. bisporigera]]'' of eastern North America, and the European ''[[Amanita virosa|A. virosa]]''. \"Death angel\" is used as an alternate common name.<ref name=\"arora86\"/>\n\n==Description==\n''A. ocreata'' is generally stouter than the other fungi termed destroying angels. It first appears as a white egg-shaped object covered with a universal [[veil (botany)|veil]]. As it grows, the mushroom breaks free, though there may rarely be ragged patches of veil left at the cap edges. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially hemispherical, before becoming more convex and flattening, sometimes irregularly. This may result in undulations in the cap, which may reach up to 12&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;in) in diameter. The colour varies from white, through yellowish-white to shades of ochre, sometimes with a brownish centre. Occasionally parts of the fruiting bodies may have pinkish tones. The rest of the fungus below the cap is white. The crowded [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free to narrowly adnate. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 8\u201320&nbsp;cm (3\u20138&nbsp;in) high and 1.5\u20132&nbsp;cm (\u00bd\u2013\u2154&nbsp;in) thick at the apex, and bears a thin white membranous [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[volva (mycology)|volva]] is thin, smooth and sac-like, although may be quite extensive and contain almost half the stipe. The [[spore print]] is white, and the [[wiktionary:globose|subglobose]] to [[wiktionary:ovoid|ovoid]] to [[wiktionary:ellipsoid|subellipsoid]], [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] spores are 9\u201314 x 7\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm viewed under a microscope.<ref name=\"Amth77\"/> There is typically no smell, though some fruiting bodies may have a slight odour, described as that of bleach or [[chlorine]], dead fish or [[iodine]]. Like other destroying angels, the flesh stains yellow when treated with [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH).<ref name=\"Thiers\">Thiers HD. (1982).

It also resembles and grows in the same areas as the edible and prized ''[[Amanita velosa]]'', which can be distinguished from ''A. ocreata'' by its lack of ring, [[wikt:striate|striate]] [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] margin and thick [[universal veil]] remnants comprising the veil.<ref name=\"arora86\">{{cite book |last=Arora |first=David |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms demystified: a comprehensive guide to the fleshy fungi |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |pages=271\u201373 |authorlink=David Arora |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref> The edible ''[[Amanita calyptroderma]]'' lacks a ring and is more likely to have veil patches remaining on its cap, which is generally darker.

It grows in damp mossy grassland, in [[coniferous forest]] clearings, or on wooded [[Heath (habitat)|heaths]]. It is probably the most common of the small genus ''[[Cystoderma]]''. Possibly [[edible mushroom|edible]], it is not recommended due to its unpleasant odour and resemblance to [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] species.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Cystoderma amianthinum'' was first noted by the Italian-Austrian naturalist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]], who called it ''Agaricus amianthinus'' in 1772. The present generic name ''Cystoderma'' was erected by Swiss mycologist [[Victor Fayod]] in 1889, and is roughly translated as 'blistered skin', and is probably a reference to the appearance of the [[cap cuticle|pellicle]] (cap skin).<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is usually between {{convert|2|and|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter, convex to bell-shaped, and later flat with a slight depression around a low umbo (central boss). It is dry and powdery, often with a shaggy or fringed margin (appendiculate), and is saffron-yellow or orange-ochre. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is cylindrical, and has a flaky-granular sheath beneath a fleeting, powdery [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white initially, and become creamy later. They are adnexed (narrowly attached to the stem), and initially quite crowded.<ref name=H&R1992>{{cite book| author = Helmut and Renate Grunert  | year = 1992 | title = Field Guide to MUSHROOMS of Britain and Europe (English Edition) | publisher = The Crowood Press Ltd | isbn = 1-85223-592-6}}</ref> The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page=138}}</ref> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and yellowish, with an unpleasant mouldy smell.\n\nA very similar form with a markedly radially wrinkled cap, has been separated by some authors, and given the binomial ''Cystoderma rugoso-reticulatum''.<ref name=H&R1992/>\n\n''[[Cystodermella granulosa]]'', and ''[[Cystodermella cinnabarina]]'' are both redder as a rule, and have adnate gills (broadly attached to the stem).<ref name=Phillips06/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n'' Cystoderma amianthinum'' is widespread in Europe and North America, and common in northern [[temperate]] zones.

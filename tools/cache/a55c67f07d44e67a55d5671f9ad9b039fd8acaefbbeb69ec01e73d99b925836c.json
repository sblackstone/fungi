It is a small, fragile, long stemmed, and variably coloured brittlegill, found in mixed forests, and woods in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[North America]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Russula fragilis'' was first described as ''Agaricus fragilis'' by mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801, and later placed in the genus ''[[Russula]]'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is 2\u20135&nbsp;cm (0.8&ndash;2&nbsp;in) in diameter. It is very variable in colour, and can be dark purplish, with a dark, almost black centre, or may be various shades of olive-green, or violet-pink, or even pale yellow. The colour tends to fade quickly, and can become very pale.  At first the cap shape is convex, but it later flattens.  The [[pileipellis|cap skin]] peels to three quarters, and older specimens often have a furrowed margin. The fragile, white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is long for the size of the cap, and narrowly club-shaped. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed, and white giving a [[spore print]] of the same colour. They have distinctive nicks, or notches on their free edges, that can be seen under a hand lens, a very good diagnostic clue to species. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white and tastes very hot, with a fruity smell.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|pages = 25}}</ref>\n\n''[[Russula betularum]]'' is frequently found with [[birch]], and although usually paler can be mistaken for washed out specimens of ''R.&nbsp;fragilis''; ''[[Russula gracillima]]'' is similar in appearance, and grows in the same locations, although neither species have nicks (serrations) on the gill edges.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Russula fragilis'' appears in late summer and autumn, usually growing in small groups. It is widespread in the northern [[temperate]] zones of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is probably [[mycorrhiza]]l with a variety of trees, including [[birch]] and [[oak]].<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Laessoe T.| year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nThis mushroom is inedible due to its very hot taste. Many hot tasting ''[[Russula]]'' species cause problems of a gastrointestinal nature when consumed, resulting in [[diarrhoea]], and vomiting.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Russula species|List of ''Russula'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1516668}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Inedible fungi]]\n[[Category:Russula|fragilis]]"}]}}}}

Distinctive characteristics of the [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] include the sticky, pale yellow [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and the abundant [[latex]] that stains the mushroom tissue [[lilac (color)|lilac]]. It is found in North America.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first described scientifically by [[Gertrude Simmons Burlingham]] in 1907. She found the fungus while collecting in [[Newfane, Vermont]].<ref name=Burlingham1907/> ''Lactarius aspideoides'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Aspideini'' of the [[subgenus]] ''Piperites'' of the genus ''[[Lactarius]]''. Within the ''Aspideini'' it is further organized in the stirps ''Aspideus'', along with ''[[Lactarius aroostookensis|L.&nbsp;aroostookensis]]'', ''[[Lactarius pseudoaspideus|L.&nbsp;pseudoaspideus]]'', and ''[[Lactarius aspideus|L.&nbsp;aspideus]]''.<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1979, p. 231.</ref>\n\nThe later [[homonym (biology)|homonym]] ''Lactarius aspideoides'', named by [[Robert K\u00fchner]] in 1975,<ref name=Kuhner1975/> is an illegitimate name under the rules of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]. It is now considered [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''[[Lactarius salicis-reticulatae]]''.\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Lactarius aspideoides K\u00fchner\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''aspideoides'' means \"shield-like\".<ref name=Roody2003/> The [[common name]] is the \"bright yellow milkcap\".<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is fleshy and firm, initially convex and umbilicate (with a central depression like a navel), then flattened before becoming funnel-shaped in maturity. Reaching diameters of {{convert|3|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}}, caps are a sulfur-yellow color, with faint zones of narrow concentric rings of lighter and darker yellow tones. The cap is very sticky when wet, and has a thick and persisting gluten. The margin (edge of the cap) is rolled inward and has minute hairs in young specimens. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are whitish then cream-colored, spotted with yellow, and packed close together. Sometimes the gills fork next the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. Their attachment to the stem is [[wikt:adnate|adnate]]\u2014broadly attached to the stalk slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem. They are {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} broad, and stain lilac when the gill tissue has been damaged. The stem is sulfur yellow, often spotted with deeper yellow, sticky when young or wet, and equal in width throughout or abruptly smaller at the base. Its surface is smooth, and it is {{convert|3|\u2013|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|\u2013|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, changing to a faint lilac color where exposed to the air. The [[latex]] is white, and has a bitter taste.<ref name=Burlingham1907/><ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\nIn deposit, such as with a [[spore print]], the [[spore]]s appear pale yellow. Use of a [[light microscopy|light microscope]] reveals further details: they are roughly spherical to broadly ellipsoid, measuring 7\u20139 by 7\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]], and covered with widely spaced, branching broad ridges between 0.5\u20131.5&nbsp;\u03bcm high. The [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells, are 35\u201340 by 8\u201311&nbsp;\u03bcm, four-spored, and club-shaped.<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1979, pp. 233\u201335.</ref>\n\n===Similar species===\nThe species is closely related to ''[[Lactarius aspideus]]'', another pale yellow ''Lactarius'' with latex that stains the flesh violet, but may be distinguished from it by the more brightly colored and zoned cap, the smaller size, and the bitter taste of the latex.<ref name=Burlingham1907/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nFruit bodies of ''Lactarius aspideoides'' grow on the ground, scattered or in small groups, in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous forest]]s. This uncommon species is typically found from summer to autumn.<ref name=Roody2003/> The distribution includes the northeastern and central United States, extending into southern Canada.<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Bessette2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette AR, Bessette A, Harris DM |title=Milk Mushrooms of North America: A Field Guide to the Genus ''Lactarius'' |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-8156-3229-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Burlingham1907>{{cite journal |author=Burlingham GS. |year=1907 |title=Some Lactarii from Windham County, Vermont |journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=85\u201395 |jstor=2478917  |doi=10.2307/2478917}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kuhner1975>{{cite journal |author=K\u00fchner R. |year=1975 |title=Agaricales de la zone alpine.

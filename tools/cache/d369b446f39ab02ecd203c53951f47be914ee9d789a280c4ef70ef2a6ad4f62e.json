Described as new to science in 1972, it is known only from the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America, where it grows under [[conifer]]s such as [[spruce]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], and [[Douglas-fir]]. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of the fungus, or [[mushroom]]s, have a slimy dark [[chestnut (color)|chestnut]]-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that becomes deeply radially grooved or [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] in maturity, and reaches diameters of up to {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are initially pinkish-buff before becoming pale brown when the [[spore]]s mature. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is [[lavender (color)|lavender]], measuring {{convert|10|\u2013|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. The mushroom produces a rusty-brown [[spore print]], with individual [[spore]]s measuring 12\u201314 by 7\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometer]]s. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom has not been determined, and it has been described as \"much too slippery to be of value\".\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was described in 1972 by mycologists [[Alexander H. Smith]] and [[James M. Trappe]], based on specimens they found in [[Cascade Head]] in [[Tillamook County, Oregon]], in October and November 1970.<ref name=Smith1972/> The species had also been called ''[[Cortinarius elatior]]'', but that name refers to a European species.<ref name=Ammirati2009/>  Within the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'', ''C.&nbsp;vanduzerensis'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[subgenus]] ''Myxacium''.<ref name=Smith1972/> This subgenus includes species in which both the cap and stem are sticky as a result of a glutinous [[universal veil]].<ref name=Kibby2009/> Based on the [[nucleic acid sequence]] similarity in the [[internal transcribed spacer]] region, ''C.&nbsp;vanduzerensis'' is closely related to the European and North American ''[[Cortinarius mucifluus|C.&nbsp;mucifluus]]'' and the Costa Rican species ''[[Cortinarius costaricensis|C.&nbsp;costaricensis]]''.<ref name=Ammirati2007/>\n\nA [[common name]] for the species is the \"pointed Cortinarius\", while the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''vanduzerensis'' refers to the [[H. B. Van Duzer Forest State Scenic Corridor|H.B. van Duzer Forest]] where the species was originally collected.<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 175\n| image1 = Cortinarius vanduzerensis 123893.jpg\n| caption1 = The cap develops deep radial grooves or corrugations as it matures.\n| image2 = Cortinarius vanduzerensis 134696.jpg\n| caption2 = The gills are closely packed and dull cinnamon-brown at maturity.\n}}\nYoung [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''C.&nbsp;vanduzerensis'' are covered with a slimy [[universal veil]];<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> the slime layer persists on the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of young mushrooms, or in moist weather. The shape of the cap is oval to conical with the margin initially [[wikt:appressed|appressed]], expanding to broadly conic or somewhat flattened in maturity, eventually reaching diameters of {{convert|4|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The cap color is initially chestnut-brown to black, but becomes paler brown as it matures. The surface is radially wrinkled or corrugated, especially near the margin. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is pallid but soon pale cinnamon-buff. The odor and taste are not distinctive. A drop of [[Iron(II) sulfate|FeSO<sub>4</sub>]] solution (a reagent commonly used in [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|mushroom identification]]) applied to the surface of the cap will turn olive-green.<ref name=Smith1972/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are pinkish-buff when young (in unopened caps), dull cinnamon-brown at maturity when the spores mature. They are packed close together, and are adnate or adnexed. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|10|\u2013|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, narrowed slightly to the base. It is pallid within but slowly cinnamon buff at least near the base. The stem surface has a thick slime-veil, and is [[lavender (color)|lavender]] to light purple on the upper portion, but darker on the lower portion. Sometimes the [[universal veil]] breaks up into concentric zones over the lower third of the stem.<ref name=Smith1972/>\n\nThe [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is not known.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Cortinarius vanduzerensis\"/> [[David Arora]] notes that it is \"much too slippery to be of value\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n[[File:Cortinarius vanduzerensis 70760.jpg|left|thumb|178x178px|Location: Caspar California]]\nThe [[spore print]] is a rusty-brown color. In face view, the [[spore]]s are broadly elliptic to [[wikt:ovate|ovate]] (egg-shaped), while in profile they appear broadly inequilateral; they have dimensions of 12\u201314 by 7\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The spore surface is roughened with warts, and they lack an [[germ pore|apical pore]]. The spores contain two [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]].<ref name=Horton2006/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are four-spored, broadly club-shaped, and have contents that are often in the form of yellow masses or [[granule (cell biology)|granules]] when [[staining|stained]] in [[Melzer's reagent]]. The cheilocystida ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are club-shaped, sometimes with an abruptly tapering point, and measure 17\u201326 by 9\u201315&nbsp;\u03bcm. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue is made of hyphae that are arranged in a roughly parallel fashion (subparallel); there are also brownish to orange-brown fat-containing hyphae present. The epicutis (outer layer of tissue) of the cap is made of a turf of gelatinous hyphae that measure 2.5\u20136&nbsp;\u03bcm wide; [[clamp connection]]s are absent to rare in the hyphae. The veil hyphae are 4\u20138&nbsp;\u03bcm wide, and [[hyaline]] (translucent) to yellow when mounted in a dilute solution of [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]]. The hyphae of the cortex of the stem are subparallel, and clamps are present.<ref name=Smith1972/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| align = right\n| image1 = Cortinarius cylindripes 92529.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (120 * 3166 / 1566) round 0}}\n| caption1 = ''Cortinarius cylindripes''\n| image2 = Cortinarius elatior Rossdorf GedSperber.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (120 * 2816 / 2122) round 0}}\n| caption2 = ''Cortinarius elatior''\n}}\nSmith and Trappe noted a similarity to the European ''[[Cortinarius elatior]]'', but this species has violet gills at first.<ref name=Smith1972/> ''[[Cortinarius collinitis|C. collinitis]]'' has a lighter brown slimy cap, with glutinous bands on the stem that are rarely tinged purple.

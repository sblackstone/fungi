It is a variably colored mushroom, found in [[deciduous]] forests, and woods in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]], and [[Scandinavia]].<ref name=C&D1995>{{cite book | author = Regis Courtecuisse and Bernard Duhem  | year = (British version) 1995 | title = Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and Europe | publisher = Harper Collins | isbn = 978-0-00-220025-7}}</ref> Appearing with broad-leaved trees in summer to early autumn, it usually has a greenish coloration.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nNoted and described by the [[South African]] born [[mycologist]] [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] as ''Agaricus lividus'' in 1801. It was placed in the ''[[Russula]]'' [[Genus]] by the Swedish mycologist, and botanist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838, with the epithet ''heterophylla''. Despite many changes, by several mycologists over the years since then, it is this binomial that is currently recognised,<ref>http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=193557</ref> and is in use at present.\n\nThe variants ''Russula heterophylla'' var. ''chlora'' Gillet 1876, and ''Russula heterophylla'' var. ''virginea'' (Cooke and Massee) A.Pearson & Dennis, have been given species status as ''[[Russula violeipes]]'', and ''[[Russula virginea]]'' respectively.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in}} in diameter. It is known to vary in colour, and can be various shades of green, brown, or ochre. It is initially round, flattening with age, and laters develops a depression. The white [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is firm, browning, and gives a salmon reaction when rubbed with [[ferrous sulphate]]. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed, and white giving a [[spore print]] of the same colour.<ref name=Phillips06/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[basidiospore|spores]] are the smallest in the genus, and are 5\u20137 by 4\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]],  spherical to elliptical, or pear shaped; warts 0.2\u20130.6&nbsp;\u00b5m high, mostly isolated, but occasionally two or three joined together, or connected by a line.<ref name=Phillips06/>\n\n===Similar species===\nGreen forms of ''Russula cyanoxantha'' can be distinguished, because they give a greenish reaction, or no reaction when rubbed with [[ferrous sulphate]] (iron salts), and have the flexible, 'greasy' feeling gills characteristic of that species.\n\n''[[Russula virescens]]'' (Schaeff.) Fr.,  has a cracked or fragmented cap surface.\n\n''[[Russula aeruginea]]'' Fr.,  grows with [[Birch]].\n\n''[[Russula langei]]'' Bon, also has a green reaction to ferrous sulphate, and smells like shellfish, with flesh that stains orange-brown.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Russula heterophylla'' appears in summer to early autumn, usually growing in small groups. It is occasional in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]], and [[Scandinavia]].<ref name=C&D1995/> It grows with several species of [[deciduous|broad-leaved]] trees, on the roots of which it is [[ectomycorrhizal]].\n\n==Edibility==\nThis mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]] and good, although care must be taken as it is very like the deadly ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'' (death cap) when young. It is also prone to slug attacks.\n\n==See also==\n[[List of Russula species|List of ''Russula'' species]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pbase.com/tmurray74/image/31682622 ''Russula heterophylla'']\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1415480}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Russula|heterophylla]]\n\n\n{{Russulales-stub}}"}]}}}}

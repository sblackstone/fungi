[[G\u00fcnther Beck von Mannagetta und Lerchenau|Beck]] (1923)</small>\n}}\n\n'''''Gyroporus castaneus''''', or commonly the '''chestnut bolete''', is a small, white-pored relation of the ''[[Boletus]]'' mushrooms. It has a brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and is usually found with [[oak]] trees. It differs from the true boletes in that the [[spore]]s are a pale straw colour.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species was described initially by the French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard]] (1742\u20131792). Formerly a member of the [[Paxillaceae]] [[family (biology)|family]], research now places this mushroom in [[Gyroporaceae]]. ''Gyroporus'' means 'having round pores', and ''castaneus'' is a reference to the chestnut colouration.\n\n== Description ==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is from 3 to 10&nbsp;cm in diameter, and pale to rusty brown in colour, which becomes darker with age. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is a similar colour, although it may be lighter at the apex. If the stem is cut vertically, it is usual to find several cavities of differing sizes inside. Both the cap and the stem have a tendency to crack or split in dry periods, or with age. The pores are small and white; they become dirtier with age, and are not attached to the stem. They darken slightly when pressed. The tubes are also whitish, and the spore print is pale yellow to straw. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm,<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref> and does not change colour on cutting. The photograph on the right shows the chunkier form; a slender form also occurs.\n[[File:Gyro.cav (2).jpg|right|thumb|190px|Illustration of typical stem cavities in ''G. castaneus'']]\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe mushroom is found occasionally in Britain and throughout continental Europe, as well as eastern North America, but it is rare in western North America.<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref> It grows in small groups, or singly, in an [[mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] relationship with oaks (''[[Quercus]]'').

As with other fungi the light spores are distributed globally and the fungi develop wherever conditions are suitable - it lives on dead and decaying wood, and is a common, widespread [[saprotroph]].\n\nThe fungus is ball-shaped, with a hard, friable, shiny black fruiting body 2 to 7 centimeters wide. It resembles a chunk of coal, which gives it several of its common names, including coal fungus and carbon balls. According to legend, [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] once hid out in a countryside homestead during war, and was put in charge of removing baking from the oven when it was done. He fell asleep and the cakes burned. ''Daldinia concentrica'' is said to resemble a cake left to this fate.\n\nThe flesh of the fungus is purple, brown, or silvery-black inside, and is arranged in concentric layers. Most sources agree that like [[Dendrochronology|tree rings]], these layers are related to seasonal growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.first-nature.com/fungi/daldinia-concentrica.php|title=Daldinia concentrica (Bolton) Ces. & De Not. - King Alfred's Cakes|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> The [[ascus|asci]] are cylindrical and arranged inside the flask-shaped [[Ascocarp|perithecium]]. When each ascus becomes engorged with fluid it extends outside the perithecium and releases spores.\n\n''D. concentrica'' contains several unique compounds, including a purple polycyclic pigment and a metabolite called concentricol, which is oxidized [[squalene]]. Many types of insects and other small animals make their home inside this species of fungus.\n\n==Uses==\nThe fungus is a useful form of tinder for fire-lighting. The brown variety is usually too heavy and dense to be much good; the black variety is lighter and better. It does need to be completely dry, whereupon it will take a spark from traditional [[fire striker|flint and steel]]. It burns slowly, much like a charcoal briquette, with a particularly pungent smoke. Once lit it usually requires constant oxygen flow to keep burning, such as through swinging the fungus or blowing on it. Fragments can be broken off to expose more embers and transferred to a tinder bundle to create an open flame.\n\n==Ecological value==\n[[Caterpillar]]s of the [[concealer moth]] ''[[Harpella forficella]]'' have been found to eat this fungus.\n\nThis fungus plays a pivotal role in accelerating the decomposition of the fallen branches of [[ash trees]], which are naturally dropped very frequently.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n*Glick, Phyllis (1979).

The unusual spores led to the species being named the [[type species]] of the now-abandoned genus ''Astrosporina''; recent studies have shown that such a genus could not exist, as the species with the defining traits do not form a [[monophyletic]] group. However, it is a part of several [[clade]]s within the genus ''[[Inocybe]]''. ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'' grows on the ground in woodland, favouring [[beech]] trees, and can be found in Europe, North America and Asia. It is inedible and probably [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] due to the presence of [[muscarine]]. The ingestion of muscarine can lead to [[SLUDGE syndrome]], and could potentially lead to death due to [[respiratory failure]].\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n''Inocybe praetervisa'' was [[species description|first described]] by [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] in the first volume of [[Giacomo Bresadola]]'s  1883 publication ''Fungi tridentini''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fungi tridentini |journal=Fungi Tridentini |author=Bresadola, Giacomo. |year=1883 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=27\u201342 |language=Latin}}</ref> The species was moved to the genus ''Astrosporina'' by [[Joseph Schr\u00f6ter]] in 1889,<ref>{{cite book |title=Kryptogamen-Flora von Schlesien |volume=3\u20131(1) |year=1885 |author=Schr\u00f6ter, Joseph. |page=576 |language=German}}</ref> but this was rejected, and the name ''Astrosporina praetervisa'' is now considered an obligate [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]].<ref>\"[http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=240227 ''Inocybe praetervisa'']\".

Mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] places the species in the [[Section (botany)|section]] ''Marginatae''; mycologist Thom Kuyper considers ''Marginatae'' a [[supersection]], and includes ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'' along with ''[[Inocybe abietis|I.&nbsp;abietis]]'', ''[[Inocybe calospora|I.&nbsp;calospora]]'' and ''[[Inocybe godeyi|I.&nbsp;godeyi]]''. [[Phylogenetics]] has shown that, in addition to the large [[clade]] of subgenus ''Inocybe'', ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'' forms a clade with ''I.&nbsp;calospora'', ''[[Inocybe lanuginosa|I.&nbsp;lanuginosa]]'' and ''[[Inocybe leptophylla|I.&nbsp;leptophylla]]''. The species are similar in that all four have [[basidiospore]]s with small [[wikt:nodule|nodules]]; it was this feature that defined the genus ''Astrosporina'', with then ''A.&nbsp;praetervisa'' as its type species. However, when phylogenetic analysis later concluded that nodulose-spored ''Inocybe'' species do not form a [[monophyletic]] group, the name ''Astrosporina'' was deemed inappropriate at a generic level. But it may be considered useful at a lower level to refer to the [[clade]] of the four ''Inocybe'' species. Of those four, ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'' is most closely related to ''I.&nbsp;calospora'', with which it forms a smaller and closer clade.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Matheny, P.

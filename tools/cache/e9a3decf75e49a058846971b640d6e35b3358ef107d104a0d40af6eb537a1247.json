Organic acids have been isolated from this species. Similar orange-capped species occur in North America and India. It was known to and valued by the Ancient Romans, who called it ''[[Boletus]]'', a name now applied to a very different type of fungus.\n\nAlthough it is edible, the Caesar's mushroom is closely related to the psychoactive [[fly agaric]], and to the deadly poisonous [[death cap]] and [[destroying angel]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n''Amanita caesarea'' was first described by Italian [[mycology|mycologist]] [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] in 1772 as ''Agaricus caesareus'',<ref>{{cite book |title=Flora Carniolica exhibiens Plantas Carnioliae Indigenas et Distributas in Classes, Genera, Species, Varietates ordine Linnaeano.

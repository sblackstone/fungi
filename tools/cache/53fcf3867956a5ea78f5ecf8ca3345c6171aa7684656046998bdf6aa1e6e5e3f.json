Two subspecies are recognised. The [[basidiocarp|fruiting bodies]] appear in [[coniferous forest|coniferous woodlands]] in autumn in northern Europe and North America. Their [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] are coloured various shades of wine-red, purple to green. Mild tasting and [[edible mushroom|edible]], it is one of the most highly regarded brittlegills for the table. It is also notable for smelling of shellfish or crab when fresh.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n''Russula xerampelina'' was originally described in 1770 as ''Agaricus xerampelina'' from a collection in [[Bavaria]] by the German mycologist [[Jacob Christian Schaeffer]], who noted the colour as ''fusco-purpureus'' or \"purple-brown\". It was later given its present binomial name by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is taken from the [[Ancient Greek]] meaning \"colour of dried vine leaves\", ''xeros'' meaning \"dry\", and ''amp\u011blinos'' or \"of the vine\".<ref>Giovanni Pacioni1993>{{cite book | author = Giovanni Pacioni  | year = 1993 | title = The Macdonald Encyclopedia of Mushrooms and Toadstools (English version) | publisher = Little, Brown & Company Ltd | isbn = 0-316- 90625-5}}</ref><ref name=Liddell1980>{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn =0-19-910207-4}}</ref>\n\nTwo subspecies have been recognised, var.

The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|6|\u2013|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, domed, flat, or with a slightly depressed centre, and sticky. The colour is variable, most commonly purple to wine-red, or greenish, and darker towards the centre of the cap. There are fine grooves up to a centimetre long running perpendicular to the margin. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] have a mild to rather bitter taste, narrowly spaced, and turn creamy-yellow on ageing specimens. The [[spore print]] is creamy-yellow to ochre. The oval spores measure 8.8\u20139.9 by 6.7\u20137.8&nbsp;[[micrometres|\u00b5m]] and are covered with 1&nbsp;\u00b5m spines,<ref name=Adamcik/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] {{convert|4|\u2013|8|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1.5|\u2013|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, is cylindrical, white or sometimes with a reddish blush, turning ochre or brownish with age.\n\nThis ''Russula'' has been divided into several similar species by some mycologists. However, they all have the singular dark green colour reaction to iron salts ([[iron(II) sulfate]]) when applied to the flesh, and all smell of shellfish. This aroma is quite distinct, and becomes stronger with age.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Thomas Laessoe | year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref>\n\nMore reddish-capped forms could be confused with the sickener (''[[Russula emetica]]''), although the latter always has a white stipe and gills; greener-capped species may resemble the also edible ''[[Russula aeruginea]]''.<ref name=\"Nilper\">{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page=122}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\n''Russula xerampelina'' is widely distributed; quite common in northern [[temperate]] zones, and often ranging into the [[Arctic Circle]], it also ranges south to [[Costa Rica]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Kuo |date=January 2005 |title=Russula xerampelina |work=Mushroomexpert |url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/russula_xerampelina.html|accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref> Appearing in the autumn, it grows solitary, or in groups with [[conifer]]s,<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\nand seems to have a preference for [[Douglas Fir]], or more rarely [[pine trees]] or [[larch]].<ref name=Adamcik/> It is sometimes found in [[deciduous]] woods, such as [[beech]] and [[oak]].<ref name=Nilper/>\n\nVariety ''tenuicarnosa'' has been found on sandy soils under pine in Slovakia and northern Italy in [[Trentino]].<ref name=Adamcik/>\n\n== Edibility ==\n\nThe taste of ''Russula xerampelina'' is mild. This ''Russula'' is considered one of the best [[edible mushroom|edible]] species of its genus, although the crab, or shrimp taste and smell will persist even when cooking. This is more pronounced and less pleasant in older specimens.<ref>''Mitchell Beazley Publishers ''>{{cite book | author = David Pegler| title = The Mitchell Beazley Pocket Guide to Mushrooms and Toadstools| publisher = Mitchell Beasley | isbn = 0-85533-347-2 | year = 1981}}</ref> The young caps are said to be superb stuffed with any suitable ingredients, and are rarely maggoty.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[List of Russula species|List of ''Russula'' species]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* \"Danske storsvampe.

It has two color states while immature\u2014white and brown\u2014both of which have various names.

In many parts of the world it is widely collected and eaten; however, resemblance to deadly or poisonous lookalikes (see below) should be noted.\n\n===Lookalike species===\nThe common mushroom could be confused with young specimens of the deadly poisonous [[destroying angel]] (''Amanita'' sp.), but the latter may be distinguished by their [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] or cup at the base of the mushroom and pure white gills (as opposed to pinkish or brown of ''A. bisporus''). Thus it is always important to clear away debris and examine the base of such similar mushrooms, as well as cutting open young specimens to check the gills. Furthermore, the destroying angel grows in [[moss]]y woods and lives symbiotically with [[spruce]].\n\nA more common and less dangerous mistake is to confuse ''A. bisporus'' with ''[[Agaricus xanthodermus]]'', an inedible mushroom found worldwide in grassy areas. ''A. xanthodermus'' has an odor reminiscent of [[phenol]]; its flesh turns yellow when bruised. This fungus causes [[nausea]] and vomiting in some people.\n\nThe poisonous European species ''[[Entoloma sinuatum]]'' has a passing resemblance as well, but has yellowish gills, turning pink, and it lacks a ring.\n\n==Cultivation history==\n[[File:Agaricus bisporus mushroom.jpg|thumb|right|''A. bisporus'' being cultivated]]\nThe earliest scientific description of the commercial cultivation of ''A. bisporus'' was made by French botanist [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] in 1707.<ref name=Spencer1985>{{cite book|author =Spencer DM|chapter=The mushroom\u2013its history and importance|veditors=Flegg PB, Spencer DM, Wood DA|title=The Biology and Technology of the Cultivated Mushroom|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|place=[[New York City|New York]]|year=1985|pages=1\u20138|isbn=0-471-90435-X}}</ref> French agriculturist [[Olivier de Serres]] noted that transplanting mushroom [[mycelia]] would lead to the propagation of more mushrooms.\n\nOriginally, cultivation was unreliable as mushroom growers would watch for good flushes of mushrooms in fields before digging up the mycelium and replanting them in beds of composted manure or inoculating 'bricks' of compressed litter, [[loam]], and manure. Spawn collected this way contained pathogens and crops commonly would be infected or not grow at all.<ref>{{harvnb|Genders|1969|p=19}}</ref> In 1893, sterilized, or pure culture, spawn was discovered and produced by the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris, for cultivation on composted horse manure.<ref>{{harvnb|Genders|1969|p=18}}</ref>\n\nToday's commercial variety of the common mushroom originally was a light brown color. In 1926, a [[Pennsylvania]] mushroom farmer found a clump of common mushrooms with white caps in his mushroom bed. As with the reception of white bread, it was seen as a more attractive food item and became very popular.<ref>{{harvnb|Genders|1969|p=121}}</ref> Similar to the commercial development history of the [[navel orange]] and [[Red Delicious]] apple, cultures were grown from the mutant individuals, and most of the cream-colored store mushrooms marketed today are products of this 1926 chance natural mutation.\n\n''A. bisporus'' is now cultivated in at least seventy countries throughout the world.<ref name=Cappelli84/> Global production in the early 1990s was reported to be more than {{convert|1.5|e6ST|e9kg|abbr=off}}, worth more than US$2 billion.<ref name=Chang1993>{{cite book|author=Chang ST|veditors=((Chiu S-W)), Buswell J, ((Chang S-T)) |chapter=Mushroom biology: the impact on mushroom production and mushroom products|title=Mushroom Biology and Mushroom Products|publisher=[[Chinese University Press]]|place=[[Hong Kong]]|year=1993|pages=3\u201320|isbn=962-201-610-3}}</ref>\n\n==Nutritional profile==\n{{nutritional value\n| name=Agaricus bisporus, white raw\n| water=92.45 g\n| kJ=93\n| protein=3.09 g\n| fat=0.34 g\n| carbs=3.26 g\n| fiber=1 g\n| sugars=1.98 g\n| iron_mg=0.5\n| magnesium_mg=9\n| phosphorus_mg=86\n| potassium_mg=318\n| sodium_mg=3\n| zinc_mg=0.52\n| vitC_mg=2.1\n| thiamin_mg=0.081\n| riboflavin_mg=0.402\n| niacin_mg=3.607\n| pantothenic_mg=1.497\n| vitB6_mg=0.104\n| folate_ug=17\n| vitB12_ug=0.04\n| vitD_ug=0.2\n| source_usda = 1\n| note=[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=11260&format=Full Link to USDA Database entry]\n}}\n\nIn a 100-gram serving, raw white mushrooms provide {{convert|93|kJ|kcal|abbr=off}} of [[food energy]] and are an excellent source (> 19% of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of the [[B vitamins]], [[riboflavin]], [[niacin]], and [[pantothenic acid]] (table).

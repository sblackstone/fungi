Although rare, the species is widely distributed, having been reported from Asia, North America, Northern Africa, Europe, and New Zealand. The fungus grows as a [[parasitism|parasite]] on the [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of other gilled mushrooms, usually ''[[Clitocybe nebularis]]''. ''V.&nbsp;surrecta'' mushrooms have white or greyish silky-hairy [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that turns pink in maturity. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], also white, is up to {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and has a sack-like [[volva (mycology)|volva]] at its base.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Knapp 1829 Agaricus surrectus.jpg|thumb|left|Knapp's 1829 drawing of ''Agaricus surrectus'']]\nThe species was first mentioned in scientific literature as ''Agaricus surrectus'' by English botanist [[John Leonard Knapp]] in his 1829 ''Journal of a Naturalist''. Knapp [[species description|described]]  the species and illustrated it in a [[woodcut]]. He wrote: <blockquote>We have even an agaric, with a bulbous root and downy pileus, that will spring from the smooth summit of another (agaricus caseus), which has a uniform footstalk, though not of common occurrence. Thus a plant, that itself arises from decay, is found to constitute a soil for another; and the termination of this chain of efficiency is hidden from us.<ref name=\"Knapp 1829\"/></blockquote> Seven years later, [[Miles Berkeley]] described the fungus as ''Agaricus loveianus'', not aware of Knapp's previous publication, and wrote that it was \"a most elegant and curious species which ... appears not to have been hitherto noticed.\"<ref name=\"Berkeley 1836\"/> Berkeley's name was frequently used in literature to refer to the fungus for over a century rather than Knapp.<ref name=\"Wells 1998\"/> In his 1917 ''North American Flora'', [[William Alphonso Murrill]] proposed a new name combination for the species based on Berkeley's name, ''Volvariopsis loweiana''.<ref name=\"Murrill 1917\"/> In 1942, [[John Ramsbottom (mycologist)|John Ramsbottom]] discovered Knapp's image and description of the fungus, and realizing it referred to the same species as Berkeley's ''Agaricus loveianus'', made the new combination ''Volvaria surrecta''.<ref name=\"Ramsbottom 1942\"/> [[Rolf Singer]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Volvariella]]'' in 1951, giving it the name by which it is known presently.<ref name=\"Singer 1951\"/>\n\n[[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analysis of DNA sequences suggests that ''V.&nbsp;surrecta'' belongs to the ''[[Volvariella pusilla]]'' group\u2014a grouping of related ''Volvariella'' species that produce small, white [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]]. In this analysis, ''V.&nbsp;surrecta'' formed a sub[[clade]] with ''[[Volvariella hypopithys|V.&nbsp;hypopithys]]''.<ref name=\"Justo 2011\"/> Almost 90 years earlier, [[Paul Konrad]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Maublanc]] recognized the relatedness of these species, and proposed that ''V.&nbsp;surrecta'' should be considered a [[subspecies]] of ''V.&nbsp;hypopithys''.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Volvaria hypopithys subsp. loveiana\"/><ref name=\"Konrad 1924\"/>\n\nThe [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''surrecta'' is [[Latin]] for \"to arise\". Berkeley's epithet ''loveianus'' honors British naturalist and Reverend [[Richard Thomas Lowe]].<ref name=\"Wells 1998\"/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the piggyback rosegill.<ref name=\"Roberts 2011\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Volvariella surrecta 178610 crop.jpg|thumb|left|The cap has a silky surface, with a yellowish to brownish center.]]\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''V.&nbsp;surrecta'' have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are initially ovoid (egg-shaped. Later they become bell-shaped or convex before flattening; reaching diameters of {{convert|2.5|-|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The cap sometimes has a shallow [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], although the presence of this character is not consistent. The cap surface is dry and covered with long, silky hairs; the color is white to light gray, with a yellowish or brownish center. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free from attachment to the stipe and are packed close together. They are initially white, later becoming pink.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1957\"/> There are many lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from cap margin to the stipe) interspersed between the gills.<ref name=\"Pegler 1998\"/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|4|-|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|4|-|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and roughly equal in width throughout the length or somewhat thicker at the base. Its color is white to light gray, and the stipe surface is [[wikt:appressed-fibrillose|appressed-fibrillose]], with a [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] coating near the apex. The white [[volva (mycology)|volva]] measures {{convert|1.3|-|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|0.6|-|1.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad, and has a lobed margin.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1957\"/> The mushroom is not [[edible mushroom|edible]].<ref name=\"Roberts 2011\"/>\n\nThe color of the [[spore print]] is brownish-pink.<ref name=\"Roberts 2011\"/> The [[spore]]s are egg-shaped to oval, measuring 5.4\u20137.6 by 3.4\u20134.9&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 20\u201331 by 5\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm. The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are [[wikt:fusoid-ventricose|fusoid-ventricose]] (distinctly enlarged in the middle and tapered toward both ends), sometimes with an elongated neck. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are also fusoid-ventricose with a neck that is sometimes short and bulbous; they measure 25\u201350 by 6\u201320&nbsp;\u03bcm. The [[hypha]]e do not have [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1957\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nBecause of its occurrence on the fruit bodies of other agarics, ''V.&nbsp;surrecta'' is unlikely to be confused with other mushrooms. Other parasitic mushrooms include ''[[Asterophora]]'' species, but these have thick gills compared to the thin gills of ''V.&nbsp;surrecta''.<ref name=\"Smith1975\"/> ''[[Collybia]]'' species, including ''[[Collybia cookei|C.&nbsp;cookei]]'', ''[[Collybia cirrhata|C.&nbsp;cirrhata]]'' and ''[[Collybia tuberosa|C.&nbsp;tuberosa]]'' are [[saprobic]], and grow on the blackened, decayed remains of other agarics. Their fruit bodies are much smaller than ''V.&nbsp;surrecta'', with cap diameters up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Knudsen 2008\"/> Although some other ''Volvariella'' species have an appearance similar to ''V.&nbsp;surrecta'', they grow in grass or in [[leaf litter]].<ref name=\"Roberts 2011\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[File:Clitocybe Nebularis.JPG|thumb|right|''Clitocybe nebularis'' is a common host for ''V.&nbsp;surrecta''.]]\n''Volvariella surrecta'' grows [[parasitism|parasitically]] on the fruit bodies of ''[[Clitocybe]]'' species, usually ''[[Clitocybe nebularis|C.&nbsp;nebularis]]'',<ref name=\"Shaffer 1957\"/> although it has been reported growing on ''[[Tricholoma]]'' species,<ref name=\"Moss 2005\"/> as well as ''[[Melanoleuca brevipes]]''.<ref name=\"Celka 2000\"/> The mushrooms grow in clusters, and fruit in the summer and autumn.<ref name=\"Miller2006\"/> The host mushroom is sometimes malformed and assumes an irregular appearance.<ref name=\"Harper 1916\"/> In an early publication, [[Charles Bagge Plowright]] commented \"Berkeley's figure ... is rather misleading. So is that given by Knapp under the name ''Agaricus surrectus'' ..., inasmuchas they show the Agaric (''A.&nbsp;nebularis''), upon which it is parasitic, in a very robust condition. In my specimen the host (''A.&nbsp;nebularis'') was quite sodden and collapsed so as to be practically unrecognisable unless one had known what species to expect.\"<ref name=\"Plowright 1903\"/>\n\n''Volvariella surrecta'' is a rare species, even though its major host is quite common; the conditions required for the parasite to produce fruit bodies are not well known.<ref name=\"Moss 2005\"/> Some authors have suggested that it may grow equally well as a parasite or a [[saprobe]].<ref name=\"Buller 1909\"/> ''V.&nbsp;surrecta'' has been found on its host in several different habitat types, including birch woodlands, pine plantations, scrub, thickets of small trees or shrubs beside roads, and under brambles. No definite preference for soil type has been determined, having been found in sands, clay, gravels, and peat.<ref name=\"Wells 1998\"/> In 1867, [[Worthington George Smith]] reported that he had successfully cultivated the species by partially burying fruit bodies under water-soaked rotting fir leaves that were placed in a bell-glass in a warm room. According to his account, a white [[mycelium]] grew over the leaves and eventually formed small white pins (immature, undifferentiated fruit bodies) that grew into fully formed mushrooms about two weeks after starting.<ref name=\"Smith 1867\"/>\n\nThe geographical distribution of the fungus includes North America north of Mexico, Northern Africa, Europe, New Zealand,<ref name=\"Roberts 2011\"/> and Asia ([[Amur region]] of Russia,<ref name=\"Taranina 2005\"/> India,<ref name=\"Atri 2005\"/> and Korea<ref name=\"Seok 1994\"/>).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Atri 2005\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Atri NS, Kour H |title=Some unrecorded wild mushrooms of Punjab, India |journal=Mushroom Research |year=2005 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=56\u20139 |issn=0972-4885}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Berkeley 1836\">{{cite book |author=Berkeley MJ |title=The English Flora: Fungi |year=1836 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=104}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Buller 1909\">{{cite book |author=Buller AHR |title=Researches on Fungi |volume=3 |year=1909 |location=London, UK |publisher=Longmans, Green |pages=442\u20136 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4732235}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Celka 2000\">{{cite journal |author=Celka D. |title=''Volvariella surrecta'': A new species in the mycoflora of Poland |journal=Acta Mycologica |year=2000 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=153\u201356 |issn=0001-625X}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Harper 1916\">{{cite journal |author=Harper ET |title=Two parasitic mushrooms |journal=Mycologia |year=1916 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=65\u201372 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0008/002/p177.htm |jstor=3753429 |doi=10.2307/3753429}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Knapp 1829\">{{cite book |author=Knapp JL |title=The Journal of A Naturalist |year=1829 |location=London, UK |publisher=J.

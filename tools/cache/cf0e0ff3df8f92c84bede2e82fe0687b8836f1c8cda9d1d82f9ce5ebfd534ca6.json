It is [[mycorrhiza]]l, forming [[symbiotic]] associations with [[plant]]s, making it very challenging to [[agriculture|cultivate]]. It is smaller than the [[golden chanterelle]] (''Cantharellus cibarius'') and has a dark brown cap with paler gills and a hollow yellow stem.  ''C. tubaeformis'' tastes stronger but less fruity than the golden chanterelle. It has a very distinctive smokey, peppery taste when raw. It grows in temperate and cold parts of Northern America and Europe, including Scandinavia, Finland, Russia, and the British Isles, as well as in the Himalayas in Asia, including [[Assam]],<ref>{{cite journal | volume = 3 | pages = 613\u2013625 | title = Wild Edible Mushrooms Used by Some Ethnic Tribes of Western Assam | journal = The Bioscan | first = T.

The cap is convex and sometimes hollow down the middle. The gills are widely separated, and of lighter color than the cap. It grows on moss or rotten wood, and in Northern America it is found mostly in conifer bogs.<ref>http://www.mushroomexpert.com/craterellus_tubaeformis.html retrieved 10 Mar 2015</ref>  It is an excellent food mushroom, especially [[frying|fried]] or in [[soup]]s, and is easily dried for preservation.\n\n[[Molecular phylogenetics]] has shown that ''C. tubaeformis'' deserves its reclassification from ''[[Cantharellus]]'' to ''[[Craterellus]]''.  Additionally, it appears that there are two distinct genetic populations that have traditionally been called ''tubaeformis'': one in [[Europe]] and eastern [[North America]], and another in western North America.  If these two groups are defined as separate species, the \"eastern\" yellowfoot would retain the scientific epithet ''tubaeformis'' due to the origin of the type specimens in [[Sweden]].<ref name=dahl00/>\n\nThe western North American ''C. tubaeformis'' has been shown to make [[ectomycorrhiza]]l relationships with western hemlock (''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'') and Douglas-fir (''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'').  It is also most common in forests with a large amount of well-rotted [[coarse woody debris]].<ref name=trappe04/>\n\n==Similar species==\n''[[Craterellus lutescens]]'' differs only in colours, but is more rare, and is found only from very wet places. Both mushrooms are edible, have a similar taste, and are usually mixed.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=dahl00>{{cite journal| title=Molecular systematics of ''Craterellus'': cladistic analysis of nuclear LSU rDNA sequence data| first=Mattias| last=Dahlman| first2=Eric| last2=Danell| first3=Joseph W.| last3=Spatafora| journal=Mycological Research| volume=104| number=4| date=April 2000| pages=388\u2013394| doi=10.1017/S0953756299001380| url=http://www-mykopat.slu.se/Newwebsite/mycorrhiza/kantarellfiler/texter/craterellus.pdf| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804023903/http://www-mykopat.slu.se/Newwebsite/mycorrhiza/kantarellfiler/texter/craterellus.pdf| archivedate=2007-08-04}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=trappe04>{{cite journal| journal=Mycologia|date=May\u2013Jun 2004| volume=96| issue=3| pages=498\u2013509| title=Habitat and host associations of ''Craterellus tubaeformis'' in northwestern Oregon| last=Trappe| first=MJ| pmid=21148873| url=http://www.mycologia.org/content/96/3/498.full| doi=10.2307/3762170|jstor=3762170}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Craterellus tubaeformis}}\n* [http://www.mushroomexpert.com/craterellus_tubaeformis.html ''Craterellus tubaeformis''] MushroomExpert.com\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q371126}}\n\n[[Category:Cantharellales]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1888]]"}]}}}}

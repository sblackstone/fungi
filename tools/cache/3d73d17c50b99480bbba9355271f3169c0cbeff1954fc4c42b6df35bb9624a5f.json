The grey-capped [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are generally found singly or in small groups in [[deciduous forest|deciduous woodland]] on chalk-based soils.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Tricholoma atrosquamosum'' was described 1837 by French naturalist [[Fran\u00e7ois Fulgis Chevallier]] as ''Agaricus atrosquamosus''. It has also been classified as a [[subspecies]] of the related ''[[Tricholoma terreum|T.&nbsp;terreum]]'' by [[George Edward Massee]]. It lies within the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Terrea'' within the [[subgenus]] ''Tricholoma'' within the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]''.<ref name=Nederlandica1999>{{cite book |author1=Noordeloos M.E. |author2=Kuyper, Th.W. |author3=Vellinga E.C. |title=Flora Agaricina Neerlandica |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=1999 |page=132 |isbn=90-5410-493-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSxG_rYhPMC&pg=PA132}}</ref> Two varieties are recognised, var.

It is grey with tiny blackish scales either all over or restricted to the apex. The base of the stipe can be tinged greenish or pinkish, and becomes reddish upon drying. The pale grey-brown [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate or free (unattached to the stipe). The mushroom has a mealy smell and taste, though there can be a fruity, peppery or spicy edge to the former.<ref name=Nederlandica1999/>  The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name=Phillips06/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Tricholoma atrosquamosum'' is found in North America and Europe. It is generally rare in Europe, and in danger of extinction in the Netherlands.<ref name=Nederlandica1999/> The fruit bodies appear under deciduous and coniferous trees, particularly [[beech]] and [[spruce]] on chalky (calcareous) soils. Variety ''squarrulosum'' is also rare (though more widely distributed in southern Europe), and associated with [[oak]], [[pine]] and spruce on chalk soils, with its fruit bodies appearing September to November.<ref name=Nederlandica1999/> Both subspecies are rare in the British Isles.<ref name=Phillips06/>\n\n==Edibility==\nBoth subspecies are [[edible mushroom|edible]],<ref name=Phillips06/> and highly regarded by some.<ref name=Lamaison05/> They can be confused with darker specimens of the poisonous ''[[Tricholoma pardinum|T.&nbsp;pardinum]]'', which is generally a larger mushroom and lacks the peppery aroma.<ref name=Riva1988>{{cite book |author=Riva, Alfredo |year=1988 |title=Fungi Europaei, Volume 3: ''Tricholoma'' |location=Italy |pages=199, 204 |publisher=Edizioni Candusso |isbn=88-901057-1-2}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of North American Tricholoma|List of North American ''Tricholoma'']]\n*[[List of Tricholoma species|List of ''Tricholoma'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q72442}}\n\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Tricholoma|atrosquamosum]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1837]]"}]}}}}

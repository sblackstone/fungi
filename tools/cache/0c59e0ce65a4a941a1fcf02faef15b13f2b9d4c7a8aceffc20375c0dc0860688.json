The species produces mushrooms with smooth, red-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|5|cm|in}} in diameter, after which it is named. It has a white [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and yellow-brown [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]]. It was first described in 2011, based on specimens collected in the 1990s and 2000s. ''C.&nbsp;badiolaevis'' is part of the [[subgenus]] ''Telamonia'', but is not part of any known [[section (botany)|section]], and does not have any close relatives within the genus. The rare species is known from Sweden and Spain, where it grows from soil in [[coniferous]] woodland.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n''Cortinarius badiolaevis'' was first described by Tuula Niskanen, Kare Liimatainen, Rafael Mahiques, Josep Ballar\u00e0 and Ilkka Kyt\u00f6vuori in a 2011 article in the academic journal ''[[Mycological Progress]]'',<ref name=\"p101\">Niskanen ''et al.'' 2011, p. 101</ref> based on specimens found in the 1990s and 2000s in both Spain and Sweden.<ref name=\"p105\"/> The [[Botanical name|specific name]] ''badiolaevis'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''badius'', meaning ''reddish-brown'', and ''laevis'', meaning ''smooth''. The name is in reference to the characteristics of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]].<ref name=\"p103\">Niskanen ''et al.'' 2011, p. 103</ref> Based on [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic analysis]], ''C. badiolaevis'' is part of the [[subgenus]] ''Telamonia'',<ref name=\"p102\">Niskanen ''et al.'' 2011, p. 102</ref> the largest but most poorly known ''Cortinarius'' subgenus. The species is not part of any known [[section (botany)|section]]s, and lacks any close relatives.<ref name=\"p101\"/>\n\n''Cortinarius badiolaevis'' is most similar to the species in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Bovini'', but they, for the most part, have darker [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] and larger spores. ''[[Cortinarius sordidemaculatus|C.&nbsp;sordidemaculatus]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius neofurvolaesus|C.&nbsp;neofurvolaesus]]'' are smaller-spored members of the section, but they have distinct [[Veil (botany)|veil]]s, as well as spores measuring wider than 5 [[micrometer]]s in width. Species in the section ''Uracei'' are distinguished by the fact that they have a slightly metallic colouration. Section ''Brunnei'' contains species which produce spores which can both have a different shape and be more covered in warts. Mushrooms produced by species in both ''Uracei'' and ''Brunnei'' have darker flesh, even if only in the base of the stem and sport dark brown [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] when mature.<ref name=\"p104\"/>\n\n==Description==\n{{ mycomorphbox\n| name             = ''Cortinarius badiolaevis''\n| whichGills       = emarginate\n| capShape         = convex\n| hymeniumType     = gills\n| stipeCharacter   = bare\n| ecologicalType   = mycorrhizal\n}}\n''Cortinarius badiolaevis'' produces mushrooms which each feature a smooth, brown to reddish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of between {{convert|2|and|5|cm|in|1}} in diameter. The caps are initially [[hemispherical]] in shape, but as the mushrooms age, they become a low convex or even almost flat. There is a broad, blunt [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] in the center of the cap, and a white margin, covered in small [[fibril]]s. The cap is [[hygrophanous]], meaning it changes colour depending on its moisture content. When moist, the surface is [[wax]]y and [[glossy]]. When it is dry, there is sometimes a zone of a different colour around the umbo, or radial streaks (that is, streaks from the center of the cap to the cap margin). The club-shaped [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures from {{convert|3.5|to|7.5|cm|in}} in height, and is {{convert|0.6|to|0.9|cm|in|1}} thick. The stem is somewhat white, and, in texture, the surface can be silk-like or covered in fibrils. White [[mycelia]] are visible at the base.<ref name=\"p104\">Niskanen ''et al.'' 2011, p. 104</ref>\n\nThe yellowish-brown gills are neither closely nor distantly spaced, with between 35 and 42 approaching the stem. The gills are quite broad, and emarginate; that is, they are shaped with a notch next to the stipe, with the connection to the stem being shallower than the rest of the gill. As they mature, they lose the yellowish colouration, and become entirely brown. There is white-brown to light brown [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] in the stem, with darker flesh found in the cap. The smell is indistinct, or vaguely reminiscent of that of [[radish]].<ref name=\"p104\"/>\n\n===Microscopic features===\n''Cortinarius badiolaevis'' produces spores which measure from 7 to 8.5 by 4.5 to 5.5&nbsp;[[micrometer]]s (\u03bcm). They range from almond-shaped to [[ellipsoid]]. There are wart-like ornamentations, but it is not heavily ornamented. They are [[dextrinoid]], meaning that they [[stain]] red-brown in [[Melzer's reagent]] or [[Lugol's solution]], and stains darkly in [[potassium hydroxide]] (the [[KOH test]]). The spores are borne on [[basidia]], with four spores per basidium. The basidia measure 25 to 35 by 7 to 10&nbsp;\u00b5m.\n\n===Similar species===\n''Cortinarius badiolaevis'' is a species that is distinct in its [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] as well as its phylogeny. One similar species is ''[[Cortinarius biformis|C. biformis]]'', but ''C.&nbsp;biformis'' can be differentiated by the typically paler colouration of the gills and cap. In addition, the stem has bluish tints.<ref name=\"p104\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Cortinarius badiolaevis'' is a rare species known from Europe; specifically, the species has been found in Spain and Sweden. It grows from [[calcareous]] soil in [[coniferous]] woodland, and is assumed to associate with [[pine]] and [[spruce]].<ref name=\"p104\"/> Specific trees under which the species has been recorded include [[Scots pine]] and the [[European black pine]].<ref name=\"p105\">Niskanen ''et al.'' 2011, p. 105</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Cortinarius species|List of ''Cortinarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite journal |author1=Niskanen, Tuula |author2=Liimatainen, Kare |author3=Mahiques, Rafael |author4=Ballar\u00e0, Josep |author5=Kyt\u00f6vuori, Ilkka |year= 2011|title= ''Cortinarius badiolaevis'', a new conifer-associated, darkening species in the subgenus ''Telamonia'' (Basidiomycota, Agaricales)|journal= Mycological Progress|volume= 10|issue= 1|pages= 101\u20135|doi= 10.1007/s11557-010-0680-7}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5173312}}\n\n[[Category:Cortinarius|badiolaevis]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 2011]]"}]}}}}

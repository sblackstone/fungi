More recently, in Europe it has been identified as responsible for [[mushroom poisoning|poisonings]]. However, it also shows promise as an anti-viral or anti-cancer mushroom.\n\n==Flavour==\nThe mushroom is described both in North America and in [[China]] as having a 'mealy' flavour, indeed in China's [[Yunnan]] province where it is most frequently consumed it is generally known as \u835e\u9762\u83cc ([[Pinyin]]: ''qiao mian jun''; lit. 'Buckwheat Noodle Mushroom') on account of this property, despite the fact that its proper name is \u9ec4\u7eff\u53e3\u8611 (lit. 'Yellow Green Mouth Mushroom').\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of North American Tricholoma|List of North American ''Tricholoma'']]\n*[[List of Tricholoma species|List of ''Tricholoma'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Qu\u00e9let 1872\">{{cite journal |author=Qu\u00e9let L. |title=Les Champignons du Jura et des Vosges |journal=M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9mulation de Montb\u00e9liard |year=1872  |volume=5 (II) |pages=43\u2013332 (see p.&nbsp;72) |language=French}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sowerby 1799\">{{cite book |author=Sowerby J. |title=Coloured Figures of English Fungi |year=1799 |volume=2 |publisher=J.&nbsp;Davis |location=London |page=54}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IndexFungorum|192411}}\n\n{{Commons|Tricholoma sejunctum}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1650982}}\n\n[[Category:Tricholoma|sejunctum]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1799]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n\n\n{{Tricholomataceae-stub}}"}]}}}}

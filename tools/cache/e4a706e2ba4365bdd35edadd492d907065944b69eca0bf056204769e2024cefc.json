The birch bolete is widespread in Europe, in the [[Himalayas]] in Asia, and elsewhere in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], occurring only in [[mycorrhiza]]l association with [[birch]] trees. It fruits from June to October.<ref>{{cite book |title=Common Edible & Poisonous Mushrooms of the Northeast |last=Fergus |first=C.

At first, it is hemispherical, and later becomes flatter. The skin of the cap is light gray-brown to reddish gray-brown, later often more or less brown, smooth, bald, dry, and rather slimy when damp.\n\nThe pores are white at a young age, later gray. In older specimens, the pores on the pileus can bulge out, while around the stipe they dent in strongly. The pore covering is easy to remove from the skin of the pileus.\n\nThe [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|5|\u2013|15|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1\u20133.5|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=8}} wide, slim, with white and dark to black flakes, and tapers upward. The basic [[mycelium]] is white.\n\nThe [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, later more gray-white and does not change color when broken. In young specimens, the meat is relatively firm, but it very soon becomes spongy and holds water, especially in rainy weather. When cooked, the meat of the birch bolete turns black.\n\n''Leccinum scabrum'' has been found in association with ornamental birch trees planted outside of its native range, such as in [[California]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Leccinum_scabrum.html | title=''Leccinum scabrum'' |publisher=California Fungi |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>\n\n==Similar species==\n[[File:Leccinum scabrum JPG7.jpg|thumb|left|''L. scabrum'' of different ages]]\n[[File:Bolet rude.jpg|thumb|left|Leccinum scabrum (Belarus).]]\nSeveral different species of ''[[Leccinum]]'' mushrooms are found in mycorrhiza with birches, and can be confused by amateurs and [[mycology|mycologists]] alike. ''[[Leccinum variicolor|L.&nbsp;variicolor]]'' has a bluish stipe. ''[[Leccinum oxydabile|L.&nbsp;oxydabile]]'' has firmer, pinkish flesh and a different pileus skin structure. ''[[Leccinum melaneum|L.&nbsp;melaneum]]'' is darker in color and has yellowish hues under the skin of the pileus and stipe. ''[[Leccinum holopus|L.&nbsp;holopus]]'' is paler and whitish in all parts.\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Leccinum scabrum'' is a European species that has been [[introduced species|introduced]] to various areas of the world.

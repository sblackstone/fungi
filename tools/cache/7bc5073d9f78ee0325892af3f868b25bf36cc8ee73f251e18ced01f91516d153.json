It is known only from near Sydney, [[Hazelbrook, New South Wales|Hazelbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Hygrocybe austropratensis'' was originally collected by [[mycology|mycologist]] [[Bruce A. Fuhrer]] in [[Warrandyte State Park]] in [[Melbourne]]'s outer northeastern suburbs on 23 May 1996, and officially described by Australian mycologist [[Anthony M. Young|Tony Young]] in 1999, from a designated [[holotype]] collected by Ray and Elma Kearney in [[Lane Cove Bushland Park]] in Sydney's suburban [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]] district on 7 June 1996.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Young AM, Wood AE |year=1999|title=The Hygrocybeae (Fungi, Homobasidiomycetes, Agaricales, Hygrophoraceae) of [[Lane Cove Bushland Park]], New South Wales |journal= Austrobaileya |volume=5 |pages=546}}</ref> Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is made with the prefix ''austro-'' \"southern\" onto the existing ''pratensis'' \"of a meadow\".<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref>\n\nIt was separated from the wide-ranging buffcap (''[[Hygrocybe pratensis]]'') by its smaller spores and the fine white fur that covers young mushrooms.<ref name=Young68>Young, p. 68</ref>\n\n==Description==\n''Hygrocybe austropratensis'' is a small mushroom with a pale orange to orange-brown [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] {{convert|1.4|\u2013|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, initially convex and later flattening irregularly. All parts of the mushroom are covered with fine white down which disappears with age. The widely spaced thick [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are decurrent, and occasionally fork at the margin of the cap, and are [[buff (color)|buff]]. The buff [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|2|\u2013|4.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} high and 0.4\u20130.7&nbsp;cm thick and may be bulbous at the base. The [[spore print]] is white, the oval [[basidiospore|spores]] measuring 7.5 x 6.3&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=Young68/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nSaprotrophic, this species has been recovered from locations in southeastern Australia including [[Hazelbrook, New South Wales|Hazelbrook]] in the Blue Mountains and Sydney Basin, and [[Warrandyte, Victoria|Warrandyte]] in outer Melbourne. Fruiting bodies appear in autumn and winter (May and June), in leaf litter and mossy areas in dry forest, particularly with ''[[Kunzea ericoides]]'', in warm temperate or subtropical climates.<ref name=Young68/>\n\nIt is currently listed by the [[Government of New South Wales]] as ''endangered'',<ref name=DECC/> that is \"likely to become extinct unless the circumstances and factors threatening its survival or evolutionary development cease to operate\" as defined by the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://threatenedspecies.environment.nsw.gov.au/tsprofile/legislation.aspx |title=NSW Threatened Species Legislation |accessdate=2008-04-16 |work=New South Wales Government - Department of Environment and Climate Change website}}</ref> Searching of suitable habitat has only yielded a very limited occurrence, and its habitat has been deemed vulnerable to waterborne pollution, weed encroachment and damage from pedestrians.<ref name=DECC>{{cite web |author= NSW Scientific Committee |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/HygrocybeAustropratensisEndSpListing.htm |title=''Hygrocybe austropratensis'' (an agaric fungus) - endangered species listing |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New South Wales Government - Department of Environment and Climate Change website}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Hygrocybe species|List of ''Hygrocybe'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Cited text===\n*{{cite book | author= Young, A.M. | year =2005 | title = Fungi of Australia: Hygrophoraceae | publisher = (Australian Biological Resources Study) CSIRO, Canberra, ACT | isbn = 0-643-09195-5}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q15206032}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hygrocybe Austropratensis}}\n[[Category:Hygrocybe|Austropratensis]]\n[[Category:Fungi native to Australia]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1999]]"}]}}}}

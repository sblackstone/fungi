It is found in temperate areas throughout the world.<ref name=Kew>{{citation |url=http://www.kew.org |chapter-url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/calvatia-gigantea-giant-puffball |chapter=''Calvatia gigantea'' (giant puffball) |title=Discover plants and fungi |publisher=www.kew.org |accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nMost giant puffballs grow to be {{convert|10|to|50|cm|in}}, sometimes to be {{convert|90|cm|in}} in diameter; although occasionally some can reach diameters up to {{convert|150|cm|in}} and weights of {{convert|20|kg|lb}}. The inside of mature Giant puffballs is greenish brown, whereas the interior of immature puffballs is white. The large white mushrooms are [[Edible mushroom|edible]] when young.<ref name=Arora>{{cite book|last=Arora|first=David|title=Mushrooms Demystified|year=1986|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-0-89815-169-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref><ref name=Bessette>{{cite book|last=Bessette|first=Alan E.|title=Mushrooms of Northeastern North America|year=1997|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, NY|isbn=978-0-8156-0388-7}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe fruiting body of a puffball mushroom will develop within the period of a few weeks and soon begin to decompose and rot, at which point it is dangerous to eat.  Unlike most mushrooms, all the [[spore]]s of the giant puffball are created inside the fruiting body; large specimens can easily contain several trillion spores. Spores are yellowish, smooth, and {{convert|3|to|5|um|in}} in size.<ref name=Arora/><ref name=Bessette/>\n\nThe classification of this species has been revised in recent years, as the formerly recognized [[class (biology)|class]] Gasteromycetes, which included all puffballs, has been found to be [[polyphyletic]]. Some authors place the giant puffball and other members of genus ''[[Calvatia]]'' in order [[Agaricales]]. Also, the species has in the past been placed in two other genera, ''Lycoperdon'' and ''Langermannia''. However, the current view is that the Giant Puffball is ''Calvatia''.<ref name=TomVolk>{{cite web|last=Volk|first=First|title=Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for August 1998|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/aug98.html|accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation status==\n\"Widespread and fairly common, and not considered of conservation concern in the UK. However, it is protected in parts of Poland and considered rare in Lithuania and of conservation concern in Norway.\"<ref name=Kew/>\n\n==Cooking==\n[[Image:Old Giant puffball Calvatia gigantea.jpg|thumb|right|Old Giant puffball.]]\nAll true puffballs are considered edible when immature, but can cause digestive upset if the spores have begun to form, as indicated by the color of the flesh being not pure white (first yellow, then brown).  Immature gilled species still contained within their universal veil can be look alikes for puffballs. To distinguish puffballs from poisonous fungi, they must be cut open; edible puffballs will have a solid white interior. Some similar mushrooms have the white interior (or yellowish) but also have the silhouette of a cap-type mushroom on the interior when cut open. These are young cap-type mushrooms and may be poisonous.\n\n== Medical uses ==\n\nPuffballs are a known [[Antihemorrhagic|styptic]] and have long been used as wound dressing,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kew Botanica Gardens Calvatia Gigantea|url=http://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:indexfungorum.org:names:265958|accessdate=11 July 2019}}</ref> either in powdered form or as slices 3&nbsp;cm thick. The fungus was often harvested prior to battles for this purpose.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Barry|title=SAS mountain and arctic survival|date=2001|publisher=Virgin|location=London|isbn=9780753505991|page=87}}</ref>\n\nIt is the main source of the anti-tumor [[mucoprotein]] [[calvacin]], which is present only in tiny quantities.\n\n==Similar fungi==\nGiant puffballs resemble the [[Scleroderma citrinum|earthball (''Scleroderma citrinum'')]]. The latter are distinguished by a much firmer, elastic fruiting body, and having an interior that becomes dark purplish-black with white reticulation early in development.  Scleroderma citrinum are poisonous and may cause mild intoxications.\n\n==Images==\n<gallery>\nImage:VesseGeante.jpg|Giant puffball.\nImage:Puffball Mushrooms On Sale.jpg|Puffball mushrooms on sale at a market in England, showing slices uniform and white all the way through.\nImage:Calvatia gigantea.jpg\nFile:Purchawka olbrzymia i widelec.jpg|Cut, with a fork for scale.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Wenyou|last2=Guo|first2=Chunxia|last3=Luo|first3=Fan|title=Optimization of Calvatia gigantea myceliaproduction from distillery wastewater|journal=Journal of the Institute of Brewing|date=January 2015|volume=121|issue=1|pages=78\u201386|doi=10.1002/jib.200}}<!--|accessdate=27 April 2015-->\n*{{cite journal|last1=Kivrak|first1=Ibrahim|last2=Kivrak|first2=Seyda|last3=Harmandar|first3=Mansur|title=Free amino acid profiling in the giant puffball mushroom (Calvatia gigantea) using UPLC-MS/MS|journal=Food Chemistry|date=1 September 2014|volume=158|pages=88\u201392|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.02.108|pmid=24731318}}<!--|accessdate=28 April 2015-->\n*{{cite journal|last1=Coetzee|first1=Johannes C.|last2=Van Wyk|first2=Abraham E.|title=Nomenclatural and taxonomic notes on Calvatia (Lycoperdaceae) and associated genera|journal=Mycotaxon|date=January 2013|volume=121|issue=1|pages=29\u201336|doi=10.5248/121.29|hdl=2263/21213}}<!--|accessdate=30 April 2015-->\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Langermannia gigantea}}\n{{Wikispecies}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6-g3sJmNvE Video footage of mature Giant Puffballs]\n* [http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/aug98.html The Giant Puffball]\n* [http://www.leffingwell.com/download/Volatile%20Constituents%20of%20The%20Giant%20Puffball.pdf VOLATILES OF THE GIANT PUFFBALL MUSHROOM (Calvatia gigantea)]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q222449}}\n\n[[Category:Lycoperdaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi found in fairy rings]]\n[[Category:Puffballs]]"}]}}}}

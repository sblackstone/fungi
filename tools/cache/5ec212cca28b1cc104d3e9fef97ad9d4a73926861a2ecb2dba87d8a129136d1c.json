The young [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] first appear as white cylinders emerging from the ground, then the bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] open out. The caps are white, and covered with scales\u2014this is the origin of the [[common name]]s of the fungus. The [[lamella (mycology)|gill]]s beneath the cap are white, then pink, then turn black and secrete a black liquid filled with [[spore]]s (hence the \"ink cap\" name). This mushroom is unusual because it will turn black and dissolve itself in a matter of hours after being picked or depositing spores.\n\nWhen young it is an excellent [[edible mushroom]] provided that it is eaten soon after being collected (it keeps very badly because of the autodigestion of its gills and cap). If long-term storage is desired, microwaving, sauteing or simmering until limp will allow the mushrooms to be stored in a refrigerator for several days or frozen. Also, placing the mushrooms in a glass of ice water will delay the decomposition for a day or two so that one has time to incorporate them into a meal. Processing or icing must be done whether for eating or storage within four to six hours of harvest to prevent undesirable changes to the mushroom. The species is [[fungiculture|cultivated]] in China as food.\n\nThe mushroom can sometimes be confused with the [[Coprinopsis picacea|magpie fungus]] which is poisonous. In America, the 'vomiter' mushroom ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'' is responsible for most cases of mushroom poisoning due to its similarity with shaggy mane and other edible mushrooms.<ref name=poisonoverview>Beug, Michael W.

Its [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] derives from ''coma'', or \"hair\", hence ''comatus'', \"hairy\" or \"shaggy\".<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063005-8|page=72}}</ref>  Other common names include lawyer's wig,<ref name=Nilper/> and shaggy mane.\n\n''Coprinus comatus'' is the type species for the genus ''[[Coprinus]]''. This genus was formerly considered to be a large one with well over 100 species. However, molecular analysis of DNA sequences showed that the former species belonged in two families, the [[Agaricaceae]] and the [[Psathyrellaceae]].<ref name=\"Red01\">{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1224525|last1=Redhead |first1=Scott A. |last2=Vilgalys |first2=Rytas |last3=Moncalvo |first3=Jean-Marc |last4=Johnson |first4=Jacqui |last5=Hopple Jr. |first5=John S |date=February 2001 |title=''Coprinus'' Pers. and the disposition of ''Coprinus'' species ''sensu lato''|jstor=1224525|journal=Taxon|volume=50|issue=1|pages=203\u201341}}</ref> ''Coprinus comatus'' is the best known of the true ''Coprinus''.\n\n==Description==\nThe shaggy ink cap is easily recognizable from its almost cylindrical cap which initially covers most of its stem. The cap is mostly white with shaggy scales, which are more pale brown at the apex. The free gills change rapidly from white to pink, then to black. It is [[deliquescent]]. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] has a loose ring and measures {{convert|10|\u2013|40|cm|in}} high by {{convert|1|\u2013|2.5|cm|in}} diameter. Microscopically it lacks pleuro[[cystidia]].

It occurs widely in grasslands and meadows in Europe and North America, from June through to November in the UK. It appears to have been introduced to Australia, New Zealand and Iceland. In Australia the species is sufficiently common to have been featured on a [[postage stamp]] issued by [[Australia Post]] in 1981.<ref>[http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0013760.jpg AustralianStamp.com Coprinus comatus image]</ref>\n\n''Coprinus comatus'' is a [[nematophagous fungus]] capable of killing and digesting the [[nematode]] species ''[[Panagrellus redivivus]]'' and ''[[Meloidogyne arenaria]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |first1=Hong |last1=Luo |first2=Minghe |last2=Mo |first3=Xiaowei |last3=Huang |first4=Xuan |last4=Li |first5=Keqin |last5=Zhang |date=Nov\u2013Dec 2004 |title=''Coprinus comatus'': A basidiomycete fungus forms novel spiny structures and infects nematode |journal=Mycologia |volume=96 |number=6 |pages=1218\u20131224 |url=http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/content/full/96/6/1218 |doi=10.2307/3762137}} {{open access}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n | doi = 10.1128/AEM.02770-06 | pmid = 17449690 | title = ''Coprinus comatus'' Damages Nematode Cuticles Mechanically with Spiny Balls and Produces Potent Toxins to Immobilize Nematodes | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 73 | issue = 12 | pages = 3916\u201323 | year = 2007 | last1 = Luo | first1 = H. | last2 = Liu | first2 = Y. | last3 = Fang | first3 = L. | last4 = Li | first4 = X. | last5 = Tang | first5 = N. | last6 = Zhang | first6 = K. | pmc=1932715}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nThe young mushrooms, before the gills start to turn black, are edible. The taste is mild; cooking produces a large quantity of liquid.  It can sometimes be used in [[mushroom soup]] with [[parasol mushroom]].  Large quantities of microwaved-then-frozen shaggy manes can be used as the liquid component of [[risotto]], replacing the usual chicken stock.\n\n''Coprinus comatus'' is not to be confused with the [[Coprinopsis atramentaria|common Ink Cap]], which contains [[coprine]] and can induce coprine poisoning.  Symptoms of coprine poisoning include vomiting, diarrhoea, palpitations and a metallic taste in the mouth.<ref>Collins, How to Identify Edible Mushrooms by Harding, Lyon & Tomblin</ref>\n\n==References==\nMuch of the above article was translated from [[:fr:Coprin|the French page]] and Dutch pages.\n{{refbegin}}<references/>\n* Pierre Montarnal: ''Le petit guide: Champignons'' (Gen\u00e8ve, 1964; Paris-Hachette, 1969).\n* R\u00e9gis Courtecuisse, Bernard Duhem: ''Guide des champignons de France et d'Europe'' (Delachaux & Niestl\u00e9, 1994\u20132000).  {{ISBN|978-2-603-00953-6}}\n* Roger Phillips: ''Mushrooms and other fungi of Great Britain and Europe'' (Pan Books Ltd. 1981 / Book Club Associates 1981) - for the English names.\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Wikispecies}}\n* [http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/may2004.html Fungus of the Month for May 2004: ''Coprinus comatus'', the shaggy mane] by Tom Volk, ''TomVolkFungi.net''.\n* [http://www.mushroomexpert.com/coprinus_comatus.html \"''Coprinus comatus'': The Shaggy Mane\"]  by Michael Kuo, ''MushroomExpert.com'', September, 2001.\n* [http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Coprinus_comatus.html \"California Fungi: ''Coprinus comatus''\"], ''MykoWeb.com''.\n* [http://www.mykoweb.com/cookbook/shaggymane.html \"Wild About Mushrooms: Shaggy Mane Mushroom\"] by Louise Freedman, ''MykoWeb.com''.\n* {{YouTube|2NJ4IE1GZAU|Time-lapse photography of inky cap growing and liquefying}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q275125}}\n\n[[Category:Agaricaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1780]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Fungi naturalized in Australia]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Carnivorous fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungal pest control agents]]"}]}}}}

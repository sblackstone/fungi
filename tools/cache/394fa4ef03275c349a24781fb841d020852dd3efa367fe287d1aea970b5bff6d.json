It is known only from the [[rainforest]] of northern [[Gabon]], a region known for its high level of [[species diversity]]. Like all [[bolete]]s, ''P.&nbsp;bembae'' has fleshy [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] that form [[spore]]s in tubes perpendicular to the ground on the underside of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]. These yellowish tubes form a surface of pores, each about 1\u20132&nbsp;mm in diameter. The brownish caps may reach up to {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, and rest atop pale brown stems up to {{convert|5.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The stems have a woolly, whitish yellow [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] of tissue that is short-lived, and may be absent in older specimens. The [[spore]]s of ''P.&nbsp;bembae'' are spindle- or fuse-shaped, and have rough surfaces\u2014a detail observable when viewed with [[scanning electron microscopy]]. The fungus grows in a [[mycorrhiza]]l relationship with ''[[Gilbertiodendron dewevrei]]'', the [[dominance (ecology)|dominant]] tree species of the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. Other similar ''Pulveroboletus'' species in the area include ''[[Pulveroboletus annulatus|P.&nbsp;annulus]]'' and ''[[Pulveroboletus croceus|P.&nbsp;croceus]]'', which may be differentiated from ''P.&nbsp;bembae'' by a combination of macro- and microscopic characteristics.\n\n==Discovery and classification==\nThe specimens of ''Pulveroboletus bembae'' upon which the species description is based were collected in April, 2008 from three locations in [[Gabon]]: in [[Ogooue-Ivindo Province]] at the Ipassa-Makokou Research Station; in the [[Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 National Park]] near [[Minvoul]], and in [[Bitouga]], both locations in the northerly province of [[Woleu-Ntem]].<ref name=Degreef2009/> Until the report of this species and the related ''[[Pulveroboletus luteocarneus]]'', 12 species of ''[[Pulveroboletus]]'' had been reported in [[tropical Africa]].<ref name=Heinemann1951/><ref name=Heinemann1964/> According to Degreef & De&nbsp;Kesel, who described the species in a 2009 publication,<ref name=Degreef2009/> ''P.&nbsp;bembae'' belongs to the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Pulveroboletus'' of the genus ''Pulveroboletus''. This section, defined by Singer in 1947,<ref name=Singer1947/> is characterized by the presence of a pulverulent-arachnoid veil (covered with fine, powdery wax granules and cobwebby) and fruit bodies that are sulphur-yellow, greenish, or yellowish-brown in color.<ref name=Singer1986/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the word ''bemba'', a name used by the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka people]] for the tree ''[[Gilbertiodendron dewevrei]]'' that is associated with the fungus.<ref name=Degreef2009/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially convex\u2014sometimes with a small rounded elevation in the center\u2014and flattens out in maturity. It reaches {{convert|30|-|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and the color is almost uniformly rust-brown to reddish brown, although young specimens have a slightly paler margin (edge). The cap surface is dry and dull, but develops a sheen with age. In older specimens, the texture of the margins is described as ''rimulose''\u2014a condition in which a surface is cracked, but the cracks do not intersect one another to form a network and mark out areas. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] extends slightly over the edge of the cap and curves downward, and is partly covered with remnants of the [[universal veil]]. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] at the center of the cap is less than about {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and gradually becomes very thin towards the margin. It is cream-colored to pale yellow with pale reddish-brown to light brown shades under the cuticle and down the [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]].<ref name=Degreef2009/>\n\nThe yellowish tubes on the underside of the cap are slightly swollen on one side, slightly depressed around the area of attachment to the stem. They are fused to the stem, in an [[adnation|adnate]] attachment; rarely, some tubes will have a decurrent \"tooth\" (tissue that runs slightly down the length of the stem) that is less than {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The pores formed by the tube ends are angular to round, and are more elongated near the stem. Their diameters are typically less than 1\u20132&nbsp;mm in diameter, and are they are the same color as the tubes, or slightly greener. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|37|\u2013|55|mm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|4|-|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, with a narrow base measuring 2\u20134&nbsp;mm, and sometimes attached to yellow [[mycelia]]. It is solid, but as it ages it becomes stuffed (as if filled with cotton) and eventually almost completely hollow. The stem surface is dull, dry, pale brown, and entirely covered with tiny brown to reddish brown squamules (small scales). The flesh of the stem is cream-colored, streaked with pale reddish brown to light brown from the upper third towards the base, while the base is light brown. The [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] is located on either the stem or the margin of the cap. This woolly, whitish yellow ring of tissue is fragile and short-lived, and has usually weathered away in older specimens. The odor of the mushroom is described as \"mildly fungoid to earthy\", and the taste \"mildly fungoid\".<ref name=Degreef2009/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe color of the [[spore print]] is unknown. The [[spore]]s are somewhat spindle-shaped, boletoid (long, lean, and fuse-shaped), with a pronounced suprahilar depression (a surface indentation formed where the spore was attached to the spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]]), and typically measure 9.3\u201311.3 by 3.9\u20134.7&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are weakly pigmented, and their rough surfaces can be seen under [[scanning electron microscopy]]. The spores are [[inamyloid]], meaning they will not absorb [[iodine]] stain from [[Melzer's reagent]]. The basidia are 26.9\u201339.3 by 9.0\u201312.0&nbsp;\u00b5m, cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and have four [[sterigmata]] (extensions that attach the spores). The [[wikt:pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are 57.4\u201392.6 by 9.4\u201317.4&nbsp;\u00b5m, spindle-shaped, moderately frequent, and extend beyond the surface of the [[hymenium]]. They have thin, hyaline walls, and are colored the same as the hymenium, without any crystals or encrustations. The [[wikt:cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] (cystidia on the gill edge), which measure 50.6\u201375.1 by 12.2\u201316.1&nbsp;\u00b5m, are more abundant than the cheilocystidia, but otherwise share the same characteristics. The cap cuticle is made of a thin physalo-[[wikt:palisododerm|palisadoderm]]\u2014a type of tissue where the ends of the [[hypha]]e reach the same length and form a palisade of cells; these short [[wikt:anticlinal|anticlinal]] hyphae are 20\u201340 by 5\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m, and support one or two inflated, brownish, spherical to spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem) terminal elements that are 25\u201345&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, non-amyloid, thin-walled, and do not have any encrustations. The cuticle of the stem is made of smooth parallel hyphae. The squamules on the cap surface have a physalo-palisadodermic arrangement made of short [[wikt:anticlinal|anticlinal]] hyphae that support elongated inflated elements of 15\u201330 by 10\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m and some scattered basidia. The flesh is made of hyaline, thin-walled hyphae, measuring 10\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and organized in a parallel fashion. These hyphae do not have an associated [[wikt:mediostratum|mediostratum]]\u2014a central strand of parallel hyphae from which other hyphae diverge sideways. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent in the hyphae of ''P.&nbsp;bembae''.<ref name=Degreef2009/>\n\n===Similar species===\nAlthough the fruit bodies of ''P.&nbsp;bembae'' are roughly similar to those in ''[[Xerocomus]]'', species in this genus do not have the powdery veil characteristic of ''P.&nbsp;bembae''. Two similar species in the same area include ''[[Pulveroboletus annulatus|P.&nbsp;annulus]]'' and ''[[Pulveroboletus croceus|P.&nbsp;croceus]]'', described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist [[Paul Heinemann]], based on specimens collected in the Congo.<ref name=Heinemann1951/> Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, ''P.&nbsp;bembae'' differs from both in its larger cystidia, its cream-colored flesh with pale reddish-brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle (compared to white in ''P.&nbsp;annulus'' and ''P.&nbsp;croceus''), its yellow mycelium (white in ''P.&nbsp;annulus'' and ''P.&nbsp;croceus''), and differences in ecology.<ref name=Degreef2009/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Gabon - Ogoou\u00e9-Ivindo.svg\n| width1 = 115\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Gabon - Woleu-Ntem.svg \n| width2 = 115\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Collections have been made in [[Ogooue-Ivindo]] (left) and [[Woleu-Ntem]] (right) provinces\n}}\nThe species has been found growing in small groups in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. This forest is [[dominance (ecology)|dominated]] by the single [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] tree species ''[[Gilbertiodendron dewevrei]]''. Not only does this tree provide food in the form of edible seeds for a wide variety of large mammals,<ref name=Blake1997/> it forms [[mycorrhiza]]l relationships with ''P.&nbsp;bembae''.<ref name=Degreef2009/> This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is thought to contribute to the success of the dominant species, by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable.<ref name=Coley1999/> The [[Congolian forests]] encompass an [[ecoregion]] known for its [[species richness]] and [[endemism]], which is spread across four countries: [[Cameroon]], [[Gabon]], [[Republic of Congo]], and the [[Central African Republic]].<ref name=EOE/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=Blake1997>{{cite journal |author=Blake S, Fay JM. |year=1997 |title=Seed production by ''Gilbertiodendron dewevrei'' in the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park, Congo, and its implications for large mammals |journal=Journal of Tropical Ecology |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=885\u201391 |jstor=2560244 |doi=10.1017/S0266467400011056}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Coley1999>{{cite journal |author=Torti SD, Coley PD. |year=1999 |title=Tropical monodominance: a preliminary test of the ectomycorrhizal hypothesis |journal=Biotropica |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=220\u20138 |jstor=2663785 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.1999.tb00134.x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Degreef2009>{{cite journal |author=Degreef J, De Kesel A. |year=2009 |title=Two new African ''Pulveroboletus'' with ornamented spores |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=108 |pages=54\u201365 |doi=10.5248/108.53}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=EOE>{{cite web |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Northwestern_Congolian_lowland_forests |title=Northwestern Congolian lowland forests |author=World Wildlife Fund (Content Partner); Mark McGinley (Topic Editor) |editor=Cutler J.

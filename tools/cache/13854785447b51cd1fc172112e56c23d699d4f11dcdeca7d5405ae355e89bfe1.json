Known from Arizona, Colorado, central Mexico, India and Costa Rica, the fungus grows on decomposing woody debris and is found in mountainous areas at elevations of {{convert|2000|to|4000|m|abbr=on}}, typically in meadows or open, grassy conifer forests. The mushrooms have convex to bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, atop slender cylindrical [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] that are up to {{convert|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The color of the caps [[hygrophanous|changes with variations in hydration]], ranging from dark [[chestnut (color)|chestnut]] brown to straw yellow or whitish when dry. The base of the stem is densely covered with conspicuous white [[rhizomorph]]s, a characteristic uncommon amongst ''[[Psilocybe]]'' species.\n\nThe species was first reported by French mycologist [[Roger Heim]] in 1956 as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]'' before he officially [[species description|described]] it under its current name a year later. Named for its association with the [[Nahua people]] also called [[Aztec]]s, ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' may have been one of the sacred mushroom species, or ''teonan\u00e1catl'' (A [[Nahuatl]] word translated variously as \"sacred mushroom\" or \"flesh of the gods\"), reported in the [[Aztec codices|codices]] of 16th-century Spanish chronicler [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]]. The mushrooms are still used for spiritual ceremonies by Nahua Indians in the [[Popocat\u00e9petl]] region, although this traditional usage is waning. The variety ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''bonetii'' has smaller [[spore]]s than the main variety, and is found at lower elevations with [[Montezuma pine]] (''Pinus montezumae'') and [[sacred fir]] (''Abies religiosa''). ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' may be distinguished from similar [[temperate]] species such as ''[[Psilocybe baeocystis|P.&nbsp;baeocystis]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe quebecensis|P.&nbsp;quebecensis]]'' by their ranges, and by differences in the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of microscopic structures like [[cystidia]].\n\n==Taxonomy and nomenclature==\nThe species was first mentioned by French mycologist [[Roger Heim]] in 1956 based on material collected by American [[ethnomycologist]] [[R. Gordon Wasson]] in [[Paso de Cort\u00e9s]], on the slopes of Popocat\u00e9petl mountain in Mexico. Heim originally named the species as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]''; limited to dried mushroom material for analysis, he only described the spores, which he explained were \"relatively longer and narrower than that of ''Psilocybe mexicana''\".<ref name=Heim1956/> A year later, Heim renamed the fungus ''Psilocybe aztecorum'' and officially [[species description|described]] it, in addition to several other Mexican ''[[Psilocybe]]'' taxa.<ref name=Heim1957/> Some of these mushrooms, including ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'', were illustrated in the popular American weekly magazine ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' (\"[[Seeking the Magic Mushroom]]\"), in which Wasson recounted the [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic visions]] that he experienced during the [[divination|divinatory]] rituals of the [[Mazatec people]], thereby introducing psilocybin mushrooms to Western popular culture.<ref name=Wasson1957/>\n\nIn 1978, Mexican mycologist and ''Psilocybe'' specialist [[Gast\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n]] [[Emendation (taxonomy)|emended]] the description of ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' to include the color variation of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] resulting from its strongly [[hygrophanous]] nature, the [[Mycena|mycenoid]] form, the [[rhizoid]]s at the base of the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], the [[lignicolous]] habitat, and the size of the spores\u2014all features that he thought were either confused, or not sufficiently detailed, in Heim's original description.<ref name=Guzman1978/> In the same publication, Guzm\u00e1n also characterized the variety ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''bonetii'', distinguished from the main variety by its smaller spores.<ref name=Guzman1978/> He had originally described this variant as a separate species, ''Psilocybe bonetii'', in 1970.<ref name=Guzman1968/> Further, Guzm\u00e1n later published ''[[Psilocybe natarajanii]]'', originally described by him from [[Tamil Nadu]] in southern India,<ref name=Guzman1995/> as a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] of ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''bonetii'';<ref name=Guzman2000/> this putative synonymy, however, is confirmed by neither [[MycoBank]] nor [[Index Fungorum]].<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Psilocybe natarajanii\"/><ref name=\"urlFungorum: Psilocybe natarajanii\"/> Guzm\u00e1n called the main variety ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''aztecorum''; for this reason, the species authority is often cited as \"''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''aztecorum'' R. Heim emend. Guzm\u00e1n\".<ref name=\"Stamets pp.92-93\">Stamets (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAmfNNwHkjIC&pg=PA92 pp. 92\u20133.]</ref><ref name=Guzman2008/>\n\n''Psilocybe aztecorum'' is the [[type species]] of Guzm\u00e1n's [[section (biology)|section]] ''Aztecorum'', a group of bluing (i.e., [[psilocybin]]-containing) ''Psilocybe'' mushrooms characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to brown or brownish white when dry; spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view; and [[pleurocystidia]] that, when present, are [[hyaline]] (translucent). Other species [[classification (biology)|classified]] in section ''Aztecorum'' are ''[[Psilocybe baeocystis|P.&nbsp;baeocystis]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe quebecensis|P.&nbsp;quebecensis]]''.<ref name=Guzmanp323-6/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''aztecorum'' refers to the [[Aztec]] Indians of central Mexico, who used this mushroom in traditional ceremonies long before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish came to America]]. The variety ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' var. ''bonneti'' is named after Dr. Federico Bonet (died 1980), [[emeritus]] professor of the [[Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas]], who assisted Guzm\u00e1n with his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] studies.<ref name=Guzmanp323-6/> The popular names of ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' are ''ni\u00f1os'' or ''ni\u00f1itos'' (children or little children), or in the Nahuatl language ''apipiltzin''<ref name=Guzmanp323-6/> which means  ''ni\u00f1os del agua'' (\"children of the water\"), alluding to their habitat along [[ravine]]s.<ref name=Singer1958/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Psilocybe aztecorum 106711.jpg|thumb|left|The gills have an adnate or adnexed attachment to the stem, sometimes with whitish edges.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is convex to bell-shaped, sometimes developing a broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] before expanding and flattening in age; it reaches a diameter of {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. In maturity, the cap eventually forms a central depression, and, in some old specimens, opens into the hollow stem. The cap surface is slimy to the touch, and has translucent striations along the margin when moist. The cap is strongly [[hygrophanous]], meaning that it will change color depending on its level of hydration. The color ranges from yellowish brown to golden yellow in young button forms to brownish gray in age, with greenish-gray tints on the margin. The color later changes to whitish from the center to the margin, finally remaining completely white; dried specimens are straw-colored to pale brownish. In contrast to most psilocybin mushrooms, the cap of ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' does not have a strong bluing reaction upon injury\u2014only the margin stains slightly green-blue.<ref name=Guzmanp323-6/>\n[[File:Psilocybe aztecorum 108691 crop.jpg|thumb|right|A young specimen with prominent rhizomorphs at the stem base, a silky-fibrillose stem surface, and a cobweb-like partial veil covering the gills]]\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[adnation|adnate]] (broadly attached to the stem slightly above the bottom of the gill) or adnexed (reaching the stem, but not attached to it), and are light violet gray to dark violet brown. They are either uniform in color, or have whitish edges. The hollow [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|5.5|to|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|3|to|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, equal in width throughout or thicker at the top, cylindric or sometimes flattened, and either straight or with turns and windings. Its surface is smooth, silky-[[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]], whitish to greyish, and stains blue-green irregularly when touched or in age. The base of the stem is densely covered with well-developed white [[rhizomorph]]s. Young mushrooms have a white cobweb-like [[partial veil]] that does not last long before it disappears, although it sometimes remains as a non-permanent [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the upper part of the stem. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish to yellowish or reddish yellow in the cap, or reddish brown in the stem, and shows little or no bluing reaction to injury. Like most of the bluing ''Psilocybe'' mushrooms, the odor and taste of ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' is slightly farinaceous (similar to freshly ground flour) in fresh specimens; dried specimens have a more intense odor. A drop of dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) stains the cap, stem, and flesh reddish brown; sometimes, the stem does not stain or stains slightly yellowish red. The [[spore print]] is blackish violet.<ref name=Guzmanp323-6/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe spores are elongated-ellipsoid in face view, roughly terete (more or less cylindrical but usually tapering at both ends), slightly inequilateral or asymmetrical in side view\u2014the so-called \"mango\" form. They typically have dimensions of 12\u201314 by 6.6\u20137.7 by 6\u20137.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]], although some spores have irregular shapes and are strongly elongated, up to 23&nbsp;\u03bcm. Spores are thick-walled (generally between 1\u20131.5&nbsp;\u03bcm), dark yellowish brown, and have a broad [[germ pore]].

They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, and some have a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the edge of a gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from a spindle to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20\u201345 by 5\u20138.2&nbsp;\u03bcm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6\u201311 by 1.6\u20132.5&nbsp;\u03bcm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.<ref name=Guzmanp323-6/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:640px; margin: 1em auto; text-align: center;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#FFF; border:1px solid #CCC; border-bottom:none;\" | Microscopy \n|-\n| [[File:Psilocybe aztecorum 106872.jpg|{{#expr: (200 * 429 / 486) round 0}}px|alt=]]\n| [[File:Psilocybe aztecorum 106866.jpg|{{#expr: (200 * 784 / 674) round 0}}px|alt=]]\n| [[File:Psilocybe aztecorum 106870 crop.jpg|{{#expr: (200 * 628 / 526) round 0}}px|alt=]]\n| [[File:Psilocybe-aztecorum-spores-sem.jpg|{{#expr: (200 * 3421 / 2645) round 0}}px|alt=]]\n|-\n| Cheilocystidia and spores; small divisions are 1&nbsp;\u03bcm\n| [[Basidium|Basidia]]\n| [[Pileipellis|Cap cuticle]]\n| Spores\n|}\nThe subhymenium (a layer of cells immediately below the [[hymenium]]) consists of spherical cells that are interwoven with [[hypha]]e; this layer is hyaline to yellowish or brownish, and does not have [[pigment]] crusted on the walls of the hyphae.

Mushrooms typically fruit in groups of 5 to 20, sometimes in bundles. Usual [[substrate (biology)|substrates]] include wood debris buried in soil, twigs or very rotten logs, and, rarely, [[pine cone]]s. The mushroom is found in [[woodland]]s (a low-density forest or wooded area that allows sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor) containing [[Hartweg's pine]] (''Pinus hartwegii'') in addition to grasses such as ''[[Festuca tolucensis]]'' and ''[[Muhlenbergia quadridentata]]'', and the [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] plant ''[[Alchemilla procumbens]]'', at elevations of {{convert|3200|\u2013|4000|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Guzman1998/> Heim found the [[type (biology)|type]] specimens at an altitude of {{convert|3500|m|abbr=on}} in an alpine [[pine]] forest.<ref name=Heim1957/> ''P.&nbsp;aztecorum'' fruits from August to October.<ref name=Guzmanp323-6/>\n\n''Psilocybe aztecorum'' is known only from the high mountains of central Mexico, such as [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt|Sierra Nevada]], [[Nevado de Toluca]], and [[Matlalcueitl (volcano)|La Malinche]] in the States of [[Mexico State|Mexico]], [[Puebla]], and [[Tlaxcala]]. According to Guzm\u00e1n, it is likely that the species also grows in other areas with high mountains, such as the States of [[Nuevo Leon]], [[Veracruz]], [[Colima]], and [[Chiapas]], which have ecological conditions similar to those of the known localities.

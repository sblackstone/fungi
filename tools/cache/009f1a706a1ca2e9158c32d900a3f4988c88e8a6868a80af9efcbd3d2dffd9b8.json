It is also a [[muscimol mushroom]]. Native throughout the [[temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] regions of the Northern Hemisphere, ''Amanita muscaria'' has been unintentionally [[introduced species|introduced]] to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a [[symbiont]] with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] species. It [[mycorrhiza|associates]] with various [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] trees.\n\nArguably the most iconic [[toadstool]] species, the fly agaric is a large white-[[lamella (mycology)|gilled]], white-spotted, usually red mushroom, and is one of the most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture.\n\nAlthough classified as [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After [[parboiling]] twice with water draining\u2014which weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom's psychoactive substances\u2014it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. ''Amanita muscaria'' is noted for its [[hallucinogenic]] properties, with its main psychoactive constituents being the compounds [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]]. The mushroom was used as an intoxicant and [[entheogen]] by the [[peoples of Siberia]], and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe name of the [[mushroom]] in many European languages is thought to derive from its use as an [[insecticide]] when sprinkled in milk. This practice has been recorded from [[Germanic languages|Germanic-]] <!--(bar England)--> and [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking]] parts of Europe, as well as the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] region and pockets elsewhere in France, and Romania.<ref name=Wasson1968>{{cite book |title=Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality |last=Wasson |first=R.

In ''The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'', German mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] listed three subspecies, though without description: ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' ssp. ''muscaria'', ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' ssp.

Specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in Alaska; this has led to the hypothesis that this was the centre of diversification for this species. The study also looked at four named varieties of the species: var. ''alba'', var. ''flavivolvata'', var. ''formosa'' (including var. ''guessowii''), and var. ''regalis'' from both areas. All four varieties were found within both the Eurasian and North American clades, evidence that these morphological forms are [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] rather than distinct subspecies or varieties.<ref name=\"Geml06\">{{cite journal|author=Geml J |author2=Laursen GA |author3=O'Neill K |author4=Nusbaum HC |author5=Taylor DL |title=Beringian origins and cryptic speciation events in the fly agaric (''Amanita muscaria'') |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=225\u201339 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16367842 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02799.x |url=http://www.lter.uaf.edu/pdf/1190_Geml_Laursen_2006.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716142858/http://www.lter.uaf.edu/pdf/1190_Geml_Laursen_2006.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |citeseerx=10.1.1.420.2327 }}</ref> Further molecular study by Geml and colleagues published in 2008 show that these three genetic groups, plus a fourth associated with oak\u2013hickory\u2013pine forest in the southeastern United States and two more on [[Santa Cruz Island]] in California, are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species.

The woody and pitted [[Pileus (mycology)|pileus]] (13/4-15/4 inches in diameter) is irregularly concave in the middle while convex in the remainder. The [[Pileus (mycology)|pileus]] is brownish fawn with coffee-colored margin, the inner substance of which, however, is thick, whitish, and unchangeable.  Pits are relatively small and conical in the middle whereas larger and elliptical in the surrounding rows. The [[hymenophore]] is greyish-fawn to reddish-brown, solid, and continuous with stem, which consists of adnate tubes and large, crowded, and oval pores. The spores are spherical (44-50 \u03bcm in diameter), orange-yellow, and echinulate with spines 3 \u03bcm long.  The fawn stem is compressed oval, 1/2*3/4 inches in diameter and 1 inch in length, which rises abruptly from a whitish mycelium 3 inches in height and 13/4*4 inches in diameter. The [[mycelium]] agglutinated grains of the sandy soil to form a stone-like basal portion resembles a concretion of ferruginous sandstone in appearance and almost in density (the whole fungus in the figure weighed as heavy as 13.25 ounces).<ref name=McAlpine1895/>\n\n{{mycomorphbox\n | name = Laccocephalum basilapidoides\n | capShape =depressed\n | hymeniumType=pores\n | stipeCharacter=bare\n | ecologicalType=saprotrophic\n | sporePrintColor=yellow-orange\n | howEdible=unknown\n }}\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe nomenclature of ''L. basilapiloides'' is rather weird. It originated from the fungus's stone-like basal portion (basilapidoides = Latin ''basis'' base+ ''lapis'' stone + Greek ''\u03bf\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae\u03c2'' likeness). However, when McAlpine and Tepper first described this species, the name they adopted was actually basilapi'''''l'''''oides. Both ''basilapiloides'' and ''basilapidoides'' were used when Lloyd moved it to genus ''Polyporus''. The term ''basilapidoides'' seems to be more accurate in grammar. The commonly accepted scientific name currently is \"Laccocephalum basilapidoides\" which differs from either McAlpine and Tepper's description or Lloyd's system.\n\nSynonyms:\n* ''Laccocephalum basilapiloides'' McAlpine & Tepper, 1895\n* ''Polyporus basilapidoides'' (McAlpine & Tepper) Lloyd, 1912\n* ''Polyporus basilapiloides'' (McAlpine & Tepper) Lloyd, 1912\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Lloyd1915>{{cite journal |author=Lloyd CG. |title=Synopsis of the stipitate Polyporoids |year=1912 |journal=Mycological Notes |issue=7 |page=115}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=McAlpine1895>{{cite journal |author=McAlpine D, Tepper JGO. |year=1895 |title=A new Australian Stone-making Fungus |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria |volume=7 |pages=166\u2013168}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Laccocephalum basilapidoides\">{{cite web |title=''Laccocephalum basilapidoides'' McAlpine & Tepper 1895 |url=http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=248790 |publisher=International Mycological Association |work=MycoBank |accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q6468154}}\n\n[[Category:Polyporaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1895]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Australia]]\n\n\n{{Polyporales-stub}}"}]}}}}

Widely distributed in southern Australia, the fungus is responsible for a disease known as ''Armillaria'' root rot, a primary cause of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' tree death and [[forest dieback]]. It is the most [[plant pathogen|pathogenic]] and widespread of the six ''[[Armillaria]]'' species found in Australia. The fungus has also been collected in Argentina and Chile. [[Basidiocarp|Fruit bodies]] have cream- to tan-coloured [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that grow up to {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on|0}} in diameter and [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] that measure up to {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on|0}} long by {{convert|1.5|cm|abbr=on|0}} thick. The fruit bodies, which appear at the base of infected trees and other woody plants in autumn (March\u2013April), are [[edible mushroom|edible]], but require cooking to remove the bitter taste. The fungus is dispersed through [[spore]]s produced on [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the caps, and also by growing [[vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]] through the root systems of host trees. The ability of the fungus to spread vegetatively is facilitated by an aerating system that allows it to efficiently diffuse [[oxygen]] through [[rhizomorph]]s\u2014rootlike structures made of dense masses of [[hypha]]e.\n\n''Armillaria luteobubalina'' was first described in 1978, after having been discovered several years earlier growing in a ''Eucalyptus'' plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian ''Armillaria'' species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected trees to show signs of disease, leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence. Studies show that the spread of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following [[Logging in Australia|logging]] operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control the spread of disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. [[Phylogenetic]] analyses have determined that ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' is closely related to ''[[Armillaria montagnei|A.&nbsp;montagnei]]'' and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species ''[[Armillaria paulensis|A.&nbsp;paulensis]]''. The distribution of ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent [[Gondwana]].\n\n== History and phylogeny ==\n''Armillaria luteobubalina'' was first described in 1978 by mycologists [[Roy Watling]] and [[Glen Kile]], who studied its effects on a fast-growing [[plantation]] of ''[[Eucalyptus regnans]]'' near [[Traralgon, Victoria]]. The plantation, established in 1963, consisted largely of trees with a mean height of about {{convert|25|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. A cluster of dead and dying trees discovered in 1973 suggested attack by a virulent primary [[plant pathology|pathogen]], that is, one capable of infecting a host before invasion by other, secondary pathogens. This finding was inconsistent with the pathogenic behaviour of the known ''Armillaria'' species in Australia at the time, ''[[Armillaria mellea|A.&nbsp;mellea]]'' and ''A.&nbsp;elegans''. Further study over the next few years showed that the fungus spread by the growth of underground [[mycelium|mycelia]] in root systems, expanding outward from the initial infected stump at an average of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} per year. Most Australian records of ''Armillaria'' infections referred to ''A.&nbsp;mellea'', based on the presence of black [[rhizomorph]]s.<ref name=\"Podger1978\" /> For over one hundred years, ''A.&nbsp;mellea'' was thought to be a [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleiomorphic]] (occurring in various distinct forms) species with a widespread distribution and host range, and variable pathogenicity.<ref name=\"Pegler2000\" /> which led to great confusion among taxonomists and plant pathologists alike.<ref name=\"Watling1982\"/> In 1973, [[Veikko Hintikka]] reported a technique to distinguish between ''Armillaria'' species by growing them together as single [[spore]] isolates on [[petri dish]]es and observing changes in the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the cultures.<ref name=\"Hintikka1973\" /> Using similar techniques, mycologists eventually determined that the ''Armillaria mellea'' [[species complex]] in Europe and North America in fact consisted of five and ten distinct \"biological species\", respectively.<ref name=\"Korhonen1978\" /><ref name=\"Anderson1979\" />\n\nWatling and Kile compared the macroscopic and microscopic characters of the pathogenic ''Armillaria'' with ''A.&nbsp;polymyces'' (now known as ''[[Armillaria obscura|A.&nbsp;obscura]]''), ''A.&nbsp;mellea'', ''[[Armillaria limonea|A.&nbsp;limonea]]'' and ''[[Armillaria novae-zelandiae|A.&nbsp;novae-zelandiae]]'' and found sufficient differences between them to warrant designating the species as new. Its [[botanical name|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''lutea'' \"yellow\", and was chosen to highlight an important distinguishing characteristic: the strong yellow colour of the cap and lack of reddish or brown tones in the stem typical of other resident ''Armillaria''.<ref name=\"Podger1978\" />\n\nA [[phylogenetic]] study of South American ''Armillaria'' species concluded that ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' is in a lineage that includes ''[[Armillaria montagnei|A.&nbsp;montagnei]]'', and these are [[cladistics|sister]] to a lineage containing ''[[Armillaria paulensis|A.&nbsp;paulensis]]'',<ref name=\"Pildain2009\" /> a species known from a single specimen collected in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], Brazil.<ref name=\"Lima2008\" /> Although they are very similar, specimens of ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' have smaller spores than Argentinian specimens of ''A.&nbsp;montagnei'', and their distinctness is well-supported with phylogenetic analysis.<ref name=\"Pildain2010\" /> Based on analysis of [[pectic]] enzymes, ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' is closely related to ''[[Armillaria limonea|A.&nbsp;limonea]]'', a species found in New Zealand;<ref name=\"Coetzee2009\" /> this result corroborates phylogenetic analyses reported in 2003<ref name=\"Coetzee2003\" /> and 2006.<ref name=\"Maphosa2006\" /> [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analysis of 27 collections of ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' from southwest Western Australia and one from Traralgon revealed four distinct polymorphic groups. The genetic variety suggests it is native to Australia.<ref name=\"Dunne2002\" /><!-- cites previous two sentences -->\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Armillaria luteobubalina 67511.jpg|thumb|Mushroom caps are covered with tiny scales and have an umbo.]]\nUp to {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on|0}} in diameter, the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is convex to flattened in shape with a central [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] (a rounded elevation) and is various shades of cream, yellow and tan. The cap surface is covered with darker scales and feels rough to the touch. The cap edge, or margin, is rolled inward in young specimens. The crowded [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]] and white to cream in colour initially, brownish-cream or pinkish brown in maturity, and sometimes with yellow or rust-coloured marks close to the margins.<ref name=\"fungimap \" /> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is central (that is, it joins the cap in the centre) and is up to {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on|0}} long by {{convert|1.5|cm|abbr=on|0}} thick. It is slightly thicker at its base than its apex, sometimes almost bulb-like. The stem surface is streaked with fibrils that run up and down its length. It has a floppy yellow wool-like [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] which may develop irregular, jagged edges with time. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, and in the stem has a woolly or stringy consistency.<ref name=\"Podger1978\" /> Although it has a hot-bitter taste, ''Armillaria luteobubalina'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]], and cooking removes the bitterness.<ref name=\"Bougher1998\" />\n\n=== Microscopic characteristics ===\nThe [[spore print]] is white when fresh, but becomes more cream-coloured when dry. The smooth [[spore]]s are oval to ellipsoid, [[hyaline]] (translucent), non-[[amyloid]] (meaning they do not absorb [[iodine]] from [[Melzer's reagent]]), and typically measure 6.5\u20137.5 by 4.5\u20135.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are thin-walled, hyaline, and lack [[clamp connection]]s at their bases. They are usually four-spored but occasionally two-spored, with [[sterigmata]] (projections that attach to the spores) up to 4&nbsp;\u03bcm long. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] that occur on the edge of a gill) are mostly club-shaped, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 15\u201330 by 6\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=\"Podger1978\" />\n\n=== Similar species ===\nFive other ''Armillaria'' species are found in Australia.<ref name=\"Robinson2003\" /> Within the range of ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'', ''[[Armillaria hinnulea|A.&nbsp;hinnulea]]'' is restricted to [[gully]] habitats. ''[[Armillaria fumosa|A.&nbsp;fumosa]]'' is a rarer species found only in poorly drained or seasonally wet locations.<ref name=\"Kile&Watling1983 \" /> ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' and ''A.&nbsp;montagnei''  share cap features and a similar unpleasant flavour, but the latter species has an olive-tinged cap, larger spores (9.5\u201311 by 5.5\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m compared to 6.5\u20137.5 by 4.5\u20135.5&nbsp;\u00b5m) and a more conspicuous annulus than those found in ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina''.<ref name=\"Pildain2010\" /> The morphology of the vegetative structures of ''[[Armillaria limonea|A.&nbsp;limonea]]'' is distinctly different than ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'', and can be used to distinguish the two species.<ref name=\"Shaw1981\" />  ''A.&nbsp;novae-zelandiae'' has a sticky more flattened cap and stem below the ring and is found in wet forests, and ''A.&nbsp;pallidula'' is a species with cream gills maturing to pale pink found in tropical Australia arising from dead tree stumps or the roots of dead or living trees.<ref name=\"Fuhrer2005\" /> ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' is the only ''Armillaria'' species which occurs in Western Australia.<ref name=\"Bougher1998\" /> Distinguishing Australian species is economically important, because ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' is more pathogenic than the other members of the genus. A molecular diagnostic test, developed in 2002, can accurately identify each species using [[DNA]] extracted from its mycelia. Before this, species identification was limited to times when fruit bodies were in season. This technology also revealed a variation in the molecular material of ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' that suggested sexual reproduction.<ref name=\"SmithWhite2002\" />\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\n[[File:Karri forest.jpg|thumb|left|''A. luteobubalina'' grows in [[Karri forest]]s, like this one in [[Pemberton, Western Australia]].]]\n''Armillaria luteobubalina'' has been recorded in southeastern Australia, from the southeastern corner of [[Queensland]] through eastern [[New South Wales]] and across [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] into southeastern [[South Australia]]. It also occurs in [[Tasmania]] and southwestern [[Western Australia]].<ref name=\"fungimap \" /> Those of the [[karri forest]]s (consisting largely of the species ''[[Eucalyptus diversicolor|E.&nbsp;diversicolor]]'') of the southwest have paler and yellower caps than those in the [[jarrah forest]]s (which contain predominantly ''[[Eucalyptus marginata]]'') further north.<ref name=\"Bougher1998\" /> The fruit bodies arise on wood, especially on stumps or around the base of trees, and often in huge numbers. They usually appear between April and July, although most production occurs in the second half of May.<ref name=\"Kile1981b\" /> Abundant in woodlands, it can invade gardens and orchards, where it can attack many woody plants.<ref name=\"Fuhrer2005\" /><ref name=\"Smith1981\" /> The honey fungus infected and killed many plants near tuart trees (''[[Eucalyptus gomphocephala]]'') which had been cut down near [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park]] in suburban Perth.<ref name=\"Bougher1998\" /> ''Armillaria luteobubalina'' is commonly found in [[eucalyptus]] forests in Australia,<ref name=\"Podger1978\" /><ref name=\"Kile1981b\" /> and is thought to be the most [[pathogenic]] and most widespread ''Armillaria'' species in the major western Australian forest types.<ref name=\"Kile et al. 1983 \" /><ref name=\"Pearce1989\" /> The mushroom has also been reported from southern South America, in Argentina and Chile.<ref name=\"Pildain2009\" /> A 2003 study of the molecular phylogenetics and pattern of its distribution in South America and Australia indicate that ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' is an ancient species, originating before the separation of the precursor supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Genetic differences between isolates in the South American and Australian populations indicate a long period of geographical separation, and the authors suggest that they \"later might be regarded as independent taxa\".<ref name=\"Coetzee2003\" />\n\n== Root rot ==\n[[File:Wielangta Unidentified Fungus 5164.jpg|thumb|Young fruit body found in [[Wielangta forest]] in southeastern [[Tasmania]], Australia]]\n\n=== Appearance of infected trees ===\nTrees that are infected by ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' show characteristic symptoms both above and below ground. Above the ground, the base of the tree develops inverted V-shaped lesions, and the infected wood undergoes [[white rot]], a fungal wood decay process where the [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]] of the [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|sapwood]] are both broken down, leaving the wood stringy. The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of the stem dies and becomes discoloured up to {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the ground. Clusters of fruit bodies appear at the base of the tree in autumn. [[Crown (botany)|Crowns]] may show gradual deterioration, or tree death may occur suddenly. Below the ground, characteristic symptoms of infections include rotting the ends of tree roots, white-rotted sapwood, and the presence of fan-shaped areas of white mycelium below dead or infected bark.<ref name=\"Robinson2003\" />\n\n=== Occurrence ===\n\nIn selectively logged eucalypt forests in the central highlands of Victoria, it has been estimated that about 3\u20135% of the forest area is \"moderately to severely affected\" by ''Armillaria'' root rot caused by ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina''.<ref name=\"Kile1983b\" /> A review of eucalypt plantations planted in New South Wales from 1994 to 2005 found that infection by ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' was rare, and only accounted for 1% of mortality in total. In this instance, the cases had been restricted to ''[[Eucalyptus nitens]]'' on the [[Dorrigo Plateau]].<ref name=\"Carnegie2007\" /> Unlike other ''Armillaria'' species found in Australia's native forests, which require a host tree to become weakened by prior infection by a different species, ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' is a primary pathogen, and can infect healthy trees.<ref name=\"Kile1983b\" /><ref name=\"Kile1981\" /> Tree roots may be infected for years before showing above-ground symptoms, making it difficult to accurately assess the true extent of disease in a forest stand.<ref name=\"Edgar1976\" /> Surveys are usually conducted in autumn, to coincide with the appearance of fruit bodies; infection is assessed by the presence of basal scars on the trees, and the appearance of fruit bodies. Several factors, however\u2014such as cost, variable on-site conditions, and non-symptomatic diseased trees\u2014make it difficult for such surveys to reliably detect all infections. One study showed that above-ground examinations detected only 50% of the trees actually infected, leading to underestimation of the incidence of true infection by 20\u201340%. The study used more intensive surveying methods to determine that 25- to 30-year-old karri regrowth forests in western Australia showed an average of 40\u201345% incidence of infection.<ref name=\"Robinson2003\" />\n\n=== Disease spread ===\n[[File:Armillaria luteobubalina 151150.jpg|thumb|left|A dense cluster of fruit bodies growing on a rotting stump]]\nSeveral studies have shown that the spread of ''Armillaria'' root rot in eucalypt forests is associated with infected [[tree stump|stumps]] that remain after an area has been [[logging|logged]].<ref name=\"Edgar1976\" /><ref name=\"Pearce1986\" /><ref name=\"Kellas1987\" /> ''Armillaria luteobubalina'' can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years.<ref name=\"Kile1981\" /> In one case reported in [[Ovens, Victoria]], the disease was spread to [[blueberry]] plants (''Vaccinium'' species) via buried fragments of infected ''Eucalyptus'' that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting.<ref name=\"Falk1995\" /> In individual forest stands,<ref>A forest stand may be defined as: \"A group of trees occupying a given area and sufficiently uniform in species composition, age, structure, site quality, and condition so as to be distinguishable from the forest on adjoining areas.\" From {{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/subsection/glossary.html |title=Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 SFMRP&nbsp;\u2013 Division of Forestry: Minnesota DNR |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref> fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees\u2014a discontinuous distribution.<ref name=\"Kile1981\" /> Large-scale [[aerial photography]] can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species.<ref name=\"Myers1983\" /> The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal [[dune]] woodlands, [[shrubland]], and [[heath (habitat)|heath]] communities.<ref name=\"Shearer1997\" /> It can be found on a wide range of hosts, but is most commonly associated with (in order of decreasing frequency) jarrah (''[[Eucalyptus marginata]]''), bull banksia (''[[Banksia grandis]]''), marri (''[[Eucalyptus calophylla|E.&nbsp;calophylla]]''), ''[[Lasiopetalum floribundum]]'', and ''[[Acacia saligna]]''.<ref name=\"Shearer1988\" /> It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo (''[[Eucalyptus wandoo|E. wandoo]]'').<ref name=\"Shearer1997b\" /> The fungus has also been reported to infect ''[[Nothofagus]]'' species in Argentina, and ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' in Chile.<ref name=\"Pildain2009\" />\n''Armillaria luteobubalina'' uses \"an elaborate, sophisticated aeration system\" that enables it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the [[rhizomorph]]s, helping it thrive in low-oxygen environments.<ref name=\"Kile1983\" /><ref name=\"Pareek2006\" /> When grown in [[microbiological culture|culture]], the [[mycelium]] develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust. This tissue is [[hydrophobic]] and resistant to becoming waterlogged. Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so-called \"air-pores\" near the perforations. These gas spaces connect the atmosphere with the central canal of the rhizomorph, to facilitate [[diffusion]] of oxygen and satiate the organism's high oxygen requirement during growth. This aeration system is thought to be an important factor in the organism's pathogenicity, allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps, where conditions may be [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]].<ref name=\"Pareek2006\" /> The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern, so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals. Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than ''Armillaria'' species whose rhizomorphs branch [[monopodial]]ly (where lateral branches grow from a main stem).<ref name=\"Morrison2004\" /> Although the structure of ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions, the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient-rich soil.<ref name=\"Pareek2001\" />\n\n=== Control ===\nMethods for controlling the spread of ''Armillaria'' root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots;<ref name=\"Robinson2001b\" /> fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts.<ref name=\"Robinson2001\" /> These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator.<ref name=\"Robinson2001\" /><ref name=\"Sch\u00fctt1985 \" /> [[Biological pest control|Biological control]] is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina''. In one study, thinning stumps of ''Eucalyptus diversicolor'' were simultaneously inoculated with ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' and one of the [[saprobic]] [[wood-decay fungus|wood decay fungi]] ''[[Coriolus versicolor]]'', ''[[Stereum hirsutum]]'' and ''[[Xylaria hypoxylon]]''; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalinea''.<ref name=\"Pearce1990\" /> These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of ''A.&nbsp;luteobubalina'' on the stump base.<ref name=\"Pearce1989\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n* [[List of Armillaria species|List of ''Armillaria'' species]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Anderson1979\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson JB, Ullrich RC |year=1979 |title=Biological species of ''Armillaria'' in North America |journal=Mycologia |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=401\u201314 |jstor=3759160 |doi=10.2307/3759160}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bougher1998\">{{cite book |title=Fungi of Southern Australia|vauthors=Bougher NL, Syme K |year=1998|pages=192\u201393|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] Press |location=Nedlands, WA |isbn=978-1-875560-80-6}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Carnegie2007\">{{cite journal |author=Carnegie AJ.|year=2007|title=Forest health condition in New South Wales, Australia, 1996\u20132005.

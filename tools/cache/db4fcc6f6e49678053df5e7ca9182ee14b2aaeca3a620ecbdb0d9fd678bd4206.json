It was originally described in 1911 by American mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] as ''Volvariopsis earlei'', based on collections made in a Cuban banana field. The fungus was later shuffled to the [[genus|genera]] ''Volvaria'' and ''[[Volvariella]]'' before [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular studies]] placed it in ''[[Volvopluteus]]'', a genus newly described in 2011.\n\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''Volvopluteus earlei'' is typically between {{convert|2.5|\u2013|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, white, and is markedly viscid when fresh. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] start out as white but they soon turn pink. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white and measures {{convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide. It has a smooth, white, sac-like [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] at its base. The cap produces a pinkish-brown [[spore print]] made of individual elliptical [[basidiospore|spores]] measuring up to 11 [[micrometre|micrometers]] long. A [[saprotrophic]] fungus that grows on grassy fields, ''V.&nbsp;earlei'' has been reported from Africa, Europe, and North America. Microscopic features and [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence data]] are of great importance for separating this [[taxon]] from related species. ''V.&nbsp;earlei'' can be distinguished from the three other ''Volvariella'' by differences in the size of the fruit bodies, cap color, spore size, and the presence or absence and form of [[cystidia]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThis species was originally [[species description|described]] by American mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1911 based on three collections made by his colleague [[Franklin Sumner Earle]] in [[Santiago de las vegas]] ([[Cuba]]) a few years earlier.<ref name=Murrill1911/> It was originally described by Murrill in the genus ''Volvariopsis'', created in the same publication, because at that time there was considerable confusion about which generic name was more appropriate for the mushrooms traditionally [[biological classification|classified]] in the genus ''[[Volvariella]]''. At the time of Murrill's proposal most species in this group were classified in the genus ''Volvaria'' erected by [[Paul Kummer]] in 1871,<ref name= Kummer1871/> but mycologists realized that the name ''Volvaria'' was already taken as it had been coined by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] for a genus of [[lichen]]s in 1805.<ref name= DeCandolle1805/> A year later Murrill transferred his species of ''Volvariopsis'' to the genus ''Volvaria'', citing practical concerns about usage of names for non-[[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]]: \"A number of species of gill-fungi described by me from tropical America in Mycologia, 1911\u20131912, under genera not found in Saccardo's ''Sylloge'', are here recombined for the benefit of those having or using herbaria arranged according to this work. Collectors, pathologists, and others who may not be intimately acquainted with taxonomic methods will probably find it more convenient to follow the one system until a comprehensive revision is completed, at least for some important groups\".<ref name=Murrill1912/><ref name=Shaffer/>\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n|clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n|label1=\n|1={{clade\n    |1=''[[Volvopluteus gloiocephalus]]''\n    |2={{clade\n       |1='''''Volvopluteus earlei'''''\n       |2={{clade\n          |1=''[[Volvopluteus asiaticus]]''\n          |2=''[[Volvopluteus michiganensis]]''\n          }}\n       }}\n   }}\n}}\n|caption=Phylogenetic relationships between ''Volvopluteus earlei'' and related species as inferred from [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] data.<ref name=Justo2011b/>\n}}\nUltimately, neither ''Volvaria'' nor ''Volvariopsis'' would be used as the correct name for this group. The generic name ''[[Volvariella]]'', proposed by the [[Argentinean]] mycologist [[Carlos Spegazzini|Carlos Luis Spegazzini]] in 1899,<ref name=Spegazzini/> would be adopted for this group in 1953 after a proposal to [[conserved name|conserve]] Kummer's ''Volvaria'' against De Candolle's ''Volvaria'' was rejected by the [[Nomenclature Committee for Fungi]]<ref name=fungi1953/> established under the principles of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]. The [[new combination|combination]] ''Volvariella earlei'' would be made by Robert L. Shaffer, who authored the first comprehensive [[monograph]]ic revision of ''Volvariella'' in North America in 1957.\n\nThe [[Molecular phylogenetics|phylogenetic study]] of Alfredo Justo and colleagues showed that ''Volvariella earlei'' is closely related to ''[[Volvopluteus gloiocephalus|Volvariella gloiocephala]]'' and that this group of species constitutes a separate [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] from the majority of the species traditionally classified in ''Volvariella''. Therefore, this taxon was transferred to the newly proposed genus ''[[Volvopluteus]]''.<ref name=Justo2011/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''earlei'' comes from the surname of [[Franklin Sumner Earle]], the collector of the original samples, to whom Murrill dedicated the species. The original [[Type (biology)|specimens]] of this species are still preserved at the [[herbarium]] of the [[New York Botanical Garden]].<ref name=\"urlNYBG\"/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''Volvopluteus earlei'' is between {{convert|25|and|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, more or less ovate or hemispherical when young, then expanding to convex or flat. It can have a low, broad [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]] in the center in old specimens; the surface is markedly viscid in fresh [[basidiocarps|fruit bodies]]; the cap is pure white, but sometimes develops pale brown tinges with age. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded together, free from attachment to the stipe, [[ventricose]], and up to 6&nbsp;mm broad; they are white when young but turn pink with age as the spores mature. The cylindrical [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|30|\u2013|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, and broadening towards the base. Its surface is white, smooth or slightly [[pruinose]] (as if covered with a fine white powder). The sac-like [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] is up to {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} high, white and has a smooth surface. The [[Context (mycology)|context]] is white in the stipe and cap and it does not change color when bruised or exposed to air. The smell and taste of the flesh are described as indistinct or herbaceous. The [[spore print]] is pinkish-brown.<ref name=Shaffer/><ref name=JustoCastro/><ref name=Lezzi/>\n\n[[File:Cheilocystidia of Volvopluteus earlei.jpg|thumbnail|right|The cheilocystidia of ''Volvopluteus earlei'' are variably shaped and often have a long apical outgrowth.]]\nThe [[basidiospores|spores]] are [[ellipsoid]] and measure 11\u201316 by 8\u201311&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. [[Basidia]] are 20\u201340 by 8\u201316&nbsp;\u03bcm; they are usually four-spored but sometimes two-spored, and, more rarely, one-spored forms can occur. Pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are absent in most collections; if present they are scarce and similar to the cheilocystidia. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 30\u201370 by 10\u201335&nbsp;\u03bcm, and are club-, spindle-, or flask-shaped, and usually each one has an apical outgrowth up to 40&nbsp;\u03bcm long. The cheilocystidia completely cover the gill edge. In the [[Form (botany)|form]] ''acystidiatus'' (N.C.Pathak) Vizzini & Contu, both pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are completely absent.<ref name=Justo2011b/> The [[cap cuticle]] (pileipellis) is an ixocutis<ref name=Vellinga1988/> (parallel [[hypha]]e embedded in a gelatinous matrix). The [[Pellis|stipe cuticle]] (stipitipellis) is a cutis<ref name=Vellinga1988/> (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the cap) are sometimes present; they measure 65\u2013140 by 10\u201325&nbsp;\u03bcm, and are mostly cylindrical.<ref name=Shaffer/><ref name=JustoCastro/><ref name=Lezzi/>\n\n==Habitat, distribution, and ecology==\n''Volvopluteus earlei'' is a [[saprotrophic]] mushroom that grows in gardens and grassy fields. It was originally found in banana fields in Cuba.<ref name=Murrill1911/> In Africa,<ref name=Heineman/> Spain <ref name=JustoCastro/> and Italy<ref name=Lezzi/><ref name=Contu/> it has been reported mostly in urban or [[Anthropogenic biome|anthropogenic]] garden areas. It usually fruits in groups of several mushrooms but it can also be found growing solitary. This species has been reported from [[Cuba]], [[North Carolina]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]].<ref name=JustoCastro/> Molecular data have so far corroborated that the European and African collections correspond to the same species.<ref name=Justo2011b/>\n\n==Similar species==\nMolecular analyses of the [[Internal transcribed spacer|internal transcribed spacer region]] clearly separate the four species currently recognized in ''Volvopluteus'', but [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, presence or absence of cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus.\n''[[Volvopluteus gloiocephalus]]'' has larger fruit bodies (cap more than {{convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter), has pleurocystidia, and the cheilocystidia lack long apical outgrowths. ''[[Volvopluteus asiaticus|V.&nbsp;asiaticus]]'' has pleurocystidia and has predominantly flask-shaped cheilocystidia without long apical outgrowths. In ''[[Volvopluteus michiganensis|V.&nbsp;michiganensis]]'', pleurocystidia are also present, and this species has smaller spores, typically less than 12.5&nbsp;\u03bcm long.<ref name=Justo2011b/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Volvopluteus earlei\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/BioloMICS.aspx?Table=Mycobank&Rec=470941&Fields=All |title=''Volvopluteus earlei'' (Murrill) Vizzini, Contu & Justo 2011  |publisher=[[MycoBank]].

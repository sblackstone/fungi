The edibility of this mushroom is controversial - some sources claim that it is [[edible mushroom|edible]], while others claim it to be [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]], although effects are little known and its toxic constituents undescribed.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe French [[mycologist]] [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] gave it its current [[binomial name]] in 1872, after it was initially described as ''Agaricus aeruginosus'' by William Curtis in 1784.

At first it is a vivid blue/green, and very glutinous (slimy), with a sprinkling of white [[Universal veil|veil]] remnants around the edge. The colour in the gluten fades, or is washed off as it matures, and it becomes yellow ocher, sometimes in patches, but mostly at the centre. Finally, it will lose the blue-green coloration completely. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is quite long and of uniform thickness. It has a fragile brown/black  [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], and below this the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is covered in fine white scales, or flakes. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially white, then clay-brown, and sometimes have a white edge. The [[spore print]] is brownish-purple, and the oval [[basidiospore|spores]] 7\u201310 x 5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan |page= 248| isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref>\n\n===Similar species===\n*''[[Stropharia caerulea]]'' Kreisel \u2013 a dowdier cousin.\n*''[[Stropharia pseudocyanea]]'' (Desm.)

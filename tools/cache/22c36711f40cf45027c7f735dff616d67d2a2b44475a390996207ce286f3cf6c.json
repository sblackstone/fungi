Uncertainty exists about which Ganoderma species was most widely utilized as Lingzhi mushroom in ancient times, and likely a few different common species were considered interchangeable. However, in the most famous book of herbal medicine in China, the Bencao Gangmu (1578), a number of different lingzhi-like mushrooms were used for different purposes and defined by color. No exact current species can be attached to these ancient Lingzhi for certain, but according to Dai et al. (2017)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dai |first1=Y.-C. |title=Ganoderma lingzhi (Polyporales, Basidiomycota): the scientific binomial for the widely cultivated medicinal fungus Lingzhi |journal=Mycological Progress |date=2017 |volume=16 |issue=11-12 |pages=1051-1055}}</ref>, as well as other researchers and based on molecular work, red reishi is most likely to be ''Ganoderma lingzhi'' Sheng H. Wu, Y. Cao & Y.C. Dai (2012). This is the species that is most widely found in Chinese herb shops today, and the fruiting bodies are widely cultivated in China and shipped to many other countries. About 7-10 other ''Ganoderma'' species are also sold in some shops, but have different Chinese and Latin names and are considered different in their activity and functions. The differences are based on concentrations of triterpenes such as ganoderic acid and its derivatives which vary widely among species. Lingzhi was formerly known as ''Ganoderma lucidum'' (Curtis) P. Karst. (1881), first described by Curtis. ''G. lucidum'' is part of a [[species complex]] that encompasses several varieties and forms (Species Fungorum).

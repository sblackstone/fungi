In Europe, it is found in fields, on sandy heaths, or grassy commons in the autumn (fall).<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Phillips, Roger | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 978-0-330-44237-4|page= 74}}</ref> It is found in rainforest and [[eucalypt]] forest as well as heathland in Australia.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Hygrocybe miniata'' was first described by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as ''Agaricus miniatus'' in 1821, before being renamed by the same author in 1838 as ''Hygrophorus miniatus''. German mycologist [[Paul Kummer]] then assigned it to the genus ''[[Hygrocybe]]'' in 1871.

The centre of mature fruiting bodies is noticeably scurfy, or scaly. This is a feature that is best seen on dry specimens, that have not been rained on. The cap colour is scarlet-orange with a yellow striate margin, and is 0.5\u20133.5&nbsp;cm in diameter. The bare [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is often long, (up to 3 times the cap diameter) and tapering towards the base, with a tendency to flatten. It is the same colour as the cap, or slightly paler, with a white base.<ref name=Phillips06/> The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are orange, adnate (with a broad attachment to the stem) or slightly decurrent; widely spaced, and somewhat notched. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is orange, and is devoid of any odour. The [[spore print]] is white, and the [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] [[basidiospore|spores]] measure 7\u20139 x 4\u20135 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=Phillips06/><ref name=C&D1995>{{cite book | author = Regis Courtecuisse and Bernard Duhem  | year = (British version) 1995 | title = Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and Europe | publisher = Harper Collins | isbn = 978-0-00-220025-7}}</ref>\n\nA very similar species (only recently described) ''[[Hygrocybe helobi|H.&nbsp;helobi]]'' (Arnolds) Bon; appears earlier in the season, prefers less acidic soils, and smells of garlic.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Thomas Laessoe | year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 978-0-7513-1070-2}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Hygrocybe miniata'' is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] species, having been recorded in most of the [[temperate]] zones.

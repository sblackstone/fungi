The species produces [[mushroom]]s with cone-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in diameter. The caps are cream, becoming browner, but they bruise red. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long, and has a \"bulb\" at the base. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] has a strong smell and an [[wikt:acrid|acrid]] taste. The mushrooms can be found on forest floors in autumn months; the species forms an [[ectomycorrhizal]] relationship to surrounding trees, favouring [[beech]]. ''I.&nbsp;godeyi'' is known to be [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], containing [[muscarine]] compounds, and consumption of the mushrooms can lead to [[SLUDGE syndrome]]. The species is sometimes mistaken for the deadly ''[[Inocybe erubescens|I.&nbsp;erubescens]]''.\n\nFirst described by [[Claude Casimir Gillet]], the species retains the name which it was first given, but has a number of [[synonym (taxonomy)|taxonomic synonyms]]. Its [[botanical name|specific name]] honours [[Louis-Luc Godey]]. Within the genus ''[[Inocybe]]'', it has been [[classification (biology)|classified]] in a number of ways, but appears to form part of a [[clade]] (that is, a group sharing a common ancestor) with species including ''[[Inocybe abietis|I.&nbsp;abietis]]'', ''[[Inocybe corydalina|I.&nbsp;corydalina]]'', ''[[Inocybe agglutinata|I.&nbsp;agglutinata]]'' and ''[[Inocybe pudica|I.&nbsp;pudica]]''.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n''Inocybe godeyi'' was first [[Species description|described]], and given its current name, by French [[botanist]] and [[mycologist]] [[Claude Casimir Gillet]] in his 1874 work ''Les Hym\u00e9nomyc\u00e8tes ou description de tous les champignons (fungi) qui croissent en France''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=189598|title= ''Inocybe godeyi''|publisher= [[Index Fungorum]]|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> The [[Botanical name|specific name]] honours the French mycologist [[Louis-Luc Godey]].<ref>{{cite book |title=British Basidiomycetaceae: a Handbook to the Larger British Fungi |author=[[Carleton Rea|Rea, Carleton]]|year=1922 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=198}}</ref> British mycologist [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]] described a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of the species, ''Inocybe godeyi'' var. ''rufescens'', in a 1909 issue of the ''[[Transactions of the British Mycological Society]]''. However, the name is now considered [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''Inocybe godeyi''. A number of other names are recognised as synonymous. Gillet's own ''Inocybe rubescens'', described in an 1883 issue of ''Revue Mycologique'', is no longer seen as a separate [[taxon]]. The same is true of [[Narcisse Th\u00e9ophile Patouillard]]'s 1884 description of ''I.&nbsp;rubescens'' as a variety of \"''Agaricus trinii''\", ''Agaricus trinii'' var. ''rubescens''. Other synonyms include [[Roger Heim]]'s 1931 ''Inocybe rickenii'' and ''Inocybe boltonii''.<ref name=\"species\">{{cite web |url= http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=189598|title= ''Inocybe godeyi'' synonymy|publisher= Species Fungorum|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin the genus ''Inocybe'', ''I.&nbsp;godeyi'' has been classified in a number of ways. In 1986, mycologist Thom Kuyper placed the species in the [[supersection]] ''Marginatae'' ([[subgenus]] ''Inocybe''), along with species including ''[[Inocybe abietis|I.&nbsp;abietis]]'', ''[[Inocybe calospora|I.&nbsp;calospora]]'' and ''[[Inocybe praetervisa|I.&nbsp;praetervisa]]''. [[Rolf Singer]] considers ''Marginatae'' a [[Section (botany)|section]] in subgenus ''Inocybe'', but he placed ''I.&nbsp;godeyi'' in the section ''Geophyllinae'' (in the [[subgenus]] ''Inocibium'') along with species including ''[[Inocybe agglutinata|I.&nbsp;agglutinata]]'' and ''[[Inocybe pudica|I.&nbsp;pudica]]''. A 2002 [[phylogenetic]] study found that Singer's ''Geophyllinae'' is probably [[monophyletic]] (that is, the taxa all come from a common, recent ancestor) and suggested that ''I.&nbsp;godeyi'' forms a [[clade]] with species including ''I.&nbsp;abietis'', ''[[Inocybe corydalina|I.&nbsp;corydalina]]'', ''I.&nbsp;agglutinata'' and ''I.&nbsp;pudica''. All species in the clade were \"smooth-spored Inocybes with [[wiktionary:metuloid|metuloid]] [[Hymenium|hymenial]] cystidia\", but there were other species that fit that description, such as ''[[Inocybe lacera|I.&nbsp;lacera]]'', that were shown not to be a part of the clade.<ref name=\"Matheny\">{{cite journal |author1=Matheny, P.

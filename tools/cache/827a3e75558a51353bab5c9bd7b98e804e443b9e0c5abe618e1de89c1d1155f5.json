The [[Basidiocarps|fruit bodies]] are medium to large, with caps up to {{convert|17|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, and a stem up to {{convert|25|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. The warts on the whitish cap surface are large\u2014up to {{convert|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on}} high. The stem has a large bulb at its base, covered with whitish to brownish scales, that may root several centimeters into the soil. The [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the stem is thick and cotton- or felt-like. It is widely distributed in [[mixed forest|mixed]] and [[deciduous forest]]s of the southeastern United States, where it grows solitarily or in groups on the ground in late summer and autumn. The mushrooms have a unique odor resembling [[bleaching powder]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first described scientifically by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] in 1859 as ''Agaricus ravenelii''.<ref name=Berkeley1859/> [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Amanita]]'' in 1887.<ref name=Saccardo1887/> It is in the subsection ''Solitariae'', [[section (biology)|section]] ''Lepidella'' in the genus ''[[Amanita]]''.<ref name=Singer1986/> Other North American species in the section ''Lepidella'' include ''[[Amanita abrupta|A.&nbsp;abrupta]]'', ''[[Amanita atkinsoniana|A.&nbsp;atkinsoniana]]'', ''[[Amanita chlorinosma|A.&nbsp;chlorinosma]]'', ''[[Amanita cokeri|A.&nbsp;cokeri]]'', ''[[Amanita daucipes|A.&nbsp;daucipes]]'', ''[[Amanita mutabilis|A.&nbsp;mutabilis]]'', ''[[Amanita onusta|A.&nbsp;onusta]]'', ''[[Amanita pelioma|A.&nbsp;pelioma]]'', ''[[Amanita polypyramis|A.&nbsp;polypyramis]]'', and ''[[Amanita rhopalopus|A.&nbsp;rhopalopus]]''.<ref name=Bhatt2004/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''ravenelli'' honors the American mycologist [[Henry William Ravenel]].<ref name=Bessette2007/> The fungus is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"pinecone Lepidella\".<ref name=McKnight1987/>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 180\n| image1 = Amanita ravenelii 57103.jpg\n| caption1 = The cap surface is covered with conical to truncate-conical warts.\n| image2 = Amanita ravenelii 92433.jpg\n| caption2 = The gills here are covered with remnants of the partial veil.\n}}\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|8|\u2013|17|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, initially hemispherical to almost round, later becoming convex to flattened. It is fleshy, white to yellowish-white, usually dry, but occasionally slightly sticky with age. The [[universal veil]] remains as a pale yellow to brownish-orange layer that breaks up into crowded, rather coarse, conical to truncate-conical warts. The warts are up to {{convert|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on}} high, becoming more scale-like towards the cap margin with age. The margin is non-striate (without any grooves), and appendiculate (with [[partial veil]] remnants hanging along the cap margin). The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free from attachment to the stem, crowded together, moderately broad, and yellowish-white to pale yellow. Interspersed among the gills are short gills (lamellulae) that do not extend completely to the stem; they are somewhat truncated (abruptly terminated) to attenuated (tapering gradually). The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|10|\u2013|25|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, and decreases slightly in thickness near the apex. It is solid (i.e., not hollow), white to pale yellow, and covered with tufts of soft woolly hairs or fibrils. It has a large basal bulb, swollen in the middle, which roots in the ground up to {{convert|5.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The partial veil is yellowish-white to pale yellow, forming a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] which is thick, woolly, delicate, and soon falls away. The universal veil remains at the stem base as thick scales, curved downward, often forming irregular rings. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm, and white to pale yellow. The mushroom tissue has an odor of chlorinated lime ([[bleaching powder]]),<ref name=Bhatt2004/> or \"old tennis shoes\".<ref name=Miller2006/> The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of ''Amanita ravenelii'' mushrooms have been described variously as unknown,<ref name=Bessette2007/> \"not recommended\",<ref name=McKnight1987/> or poisonous.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], occasionally ovoid or [[wikt:obovoid|obovoid]], thin-walled, [[hyaline]], [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and measure 8\u201311 by 5.5\u20137.5&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[spore print|spore deposit]] is white. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are 40\u201365 by 7\u201311.5&nbsp;\u00b5m, four-spored, with clamps at their bases. [[wikt:cheilocystidium|Cheilocystidia]] ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are occasionally seen as small, club-shaped cells measuring 15\u201335 by 10\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m, on thin-walled hyphae that are 3\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]], which is not clearly differentiated from the cap tissue, consists of thin-walled, interwoven [[hypha]]e 2.5\u20139&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter. The tissue of the universal veil on the cap consists of more or less parallel and erect rows of roughly spherical, and ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid cells, up to 78 by 65&nbsp;\u00b5m and spindle- to club-shaped cells up to 125 by 30&nbsp;\u00b5m. These latter cells are terminal or in short, terminal chains, and are borne on moderately abundant, thin-walled, branched, interwoven, sometimes nearly [[wikt:coralloid|coralloid]] hyphae, 3\u20139.5&nbsp;\u00b5m diameter with a few scattered oleiferous (oil-containing) hyphae, 5\u201312.5&nbsp;\u00b5m diameter. The distribution of hyphae at the stem base is similar to that on the cap, but with more filamentous hyphae.

The fungus produces [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] with shiny yellowish-orange to [[tawny (color)|tawny]] [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are {{convert|1|-|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. These are supported by [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]s measuring {{convert|2|-|5.7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and 1\u20132&nbsp;mm thick. A rare to uncommon species, it is found in northern [[temperate]] regions of North America and Europe, where it typically fruits in groups, in wet areas of [[coniferous forest]]s. There are several species with which ''M.&nbsp;corneipes'' might be confused due to a comparable appearance or similar range and habitat, but microscopic characteristics can be used to reliably distinguish between them.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Mythicomyces'' was circumscribed in 1986 by mycologists Scott Redhead and [[Alexander H. Smith]] to contain the species originally named ''Agaricus corneipes'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1861.<ref name=\"Redhead 1986\"/> Fries described the species from collections made in a [[fir]] forest near [[Alsike, Sweden]];<ref name=\"Fries 1861\"/> it was subsequently recorded in North America (northwestern USA) by [[Andrew Price Morgan]] in 1907,<ref name=\"Morgan 1907\"/> and several times by Smith.<ref name=\"Smith 1938\"/><ref name=\"Smith 1975\"/> When listing the synonyms of the species, Redhead and Smith cited the publication year of Fries's work as 1863 instead of the correct 1861, which rendered their [[Combinatio nova|new combination]] invalid according to the rules of [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]], although the generic name was valid. The [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] was subsequently published validly in 2011.<ref name=\"Redhead 2011\"/>\n\nIn its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history, the species has also been placed in ''Geophila'' by [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] in 1886,<ref name=\"Qu\u00e9let 1886\"/> and ''[[Psilocybe]]'' by [[Petter Karsten]] in 1879. ''Psilocybe'' specialist [[Gast\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n]] excluded the taxon from the latter genus in his 1983 [[monograph]], based on its roughened spores that lacked a [[germ pore]], pale spore print, stem texture, and the [[tawny (color)|tawny]] basal mycelium. Guzm\u00e1n, who examined Smith's US collections, suggested that the material might be more appropriately considered a ''[[Galerina]]'',<ref name=\"Guzm\u00e1n 1983\"/>  but Redhead and Smith noted that several features of ''Mythicomyces corneipes'' are inconsistent with placement in ''Galerina'', including spore print color, presence of [[wikt:metuloid|metuloids]], stem texture, and tawny basal mycelium.<ref name=\"Redhead 1986\"/>\n\nRedhead and Smith placed the genus in the [[Strophariaceae]], as the [[habit (biology)|biology]] of the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by [[Robert K\u00fchner]] in 1984. They noted, however, that the genus did not fit well in a more restricted concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family [[Psathyrellaceae]];<ref name=\"Kirk 2008\"/> [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis showed it to be most closely allied to this family where ''Mythicomyces'' and ''[[Stagnicola (fungus)|Stagnicola]]'' form a [[clade]] that is [[sister group|sister]] to the rest of the family.<ref name=\"Matheny 2006\"/><ref name=\"Padamsee 2008\"/> In 2019 the family ''[[Mythicomycetaceae]]'' was recognized for the two genera, ''Mythicomyces'' and ''[[Stagnicola (fungus)|Stagnicola]]''.<ref name=\"Vizzinietal2019\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mythicomyces corneipes 271224.jpg|thumb|left|A collection from [[Washington (state)|Washington]], USA]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially somewhat conical with margins rolled inward, and expands to become bell-shaped or broadly convex in maturity, reaching a diameter of {{convert|1|-|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The cap sometimes has an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], which is rounded to conical. The color of the cap ranges from dull to bright orange when young, to yellowish-brown ([[tawny (color)|tawny]]) in maturity. It is [[hygrophanous]], and the color fades to yellowish-[[buff (color)|buff]]. The cap surface is smooth and polished, and somewhat translucent, such that the radial gill lines can be seen on the margin. The gills are closely spaced, and have two tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills). Gills have an [[adnation|adnate]] to adnexed attachment to the stem, although the gills tend to secede (separate from the stem) in maturity. They are initially pallid to whitish in color before turning brownish when the spores mature. The smooth stem measures {{convert|3|-|5.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by 1\u20132&nbsp;mm thick. Yellowish to pale orange near the top and dark reddish brown below, it has tawny [[mycelium]] at the base. In maturity the stem turns black from the base upward.<ref name=\"Redhead 1986\"/> In 1907, Morgan noted the stipe to be remarkably similar to that of ''[[Marasmius cohaerens]]''.<ref name=\"Morgan 1907\"/> The mushroom flesh has an odor that ranges from indistinct to somewhat of [[geranium]]s, while its taste is indistinct to faintly bitter.<ref name=\"Redhead 1986\"/> The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown.<ref name=\"Smith 1975\"/>\n[[File:Mythicomyces corneipes 270324.jpg|thumb|right|Mythicomyces corneipes 270324.jpg|Spores]]\nThe [[spore print]] is pale purplish brown. [[Basidiospore|Spore]]s are ovoid (egg-shaped) to somewhat [[ellipsoid]]al, binucleate (visible when [[staining|stained]] with acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6\u20138.5 by 4\u20135.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges,<ref name=\"Redhead 1986\"/> and have a small [[plage (mycology)|plage]].<ref name=\"Huhtinen 1992\"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24\u201326 by 6\u20138.5&nbsp;\u00b5m. [[Cystidia]] on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle-shaped with swollen middles, and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals. They have dimensions of 43\u201386 by 10\u201324&nbsp;\u00b5m, with walls that are pale brown to translucent, and up to 3&nbsp;\u00b5m thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The [[cap cuticle]] comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized [[hypha]]e measuring 1\u20134&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae.<ref name=\"Redhead 1986\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Stagnicola perplexa]]'' is similar in appearance and shares habitats and a geographical range comparable to ''Mythicomyces corneipes''. ''S.&nbsp;perplexa'' generally has a more faded coloration, and produces brownish spore prints lacking purplish tones. The two species can be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics, as ''Stagnicola'' has smooth spores and cheilocystidia with thin walls.<ref name=\"Redhead 1986\"/> Owing to its similarly colored cap and habitat amongst mosses, ''[[Phaeocollybia attenuata]]'' might be confused with ''M.&nbsp;corneipes''. ''Phaeocollybia attenuata'' can readily be differentiated in the field by the long wirelike pseudorhiza extending below the substrate, and microscopically by the much more heavily ornamented limoniform-globose spores and absence of pleurocystidia. Other morphologically similar species include ''[[Hypholoma udum]]'' and ''[[Hypholoma elongatum|H.&nbsp;elongatum]]'', but unlike ''M.&nbsp;corneipes'', both of these agarics have smooth spores, yellow chrysocystidia, and lack metuloids.<ref name=\"GTR 2003\"/> The lookalike ''[[Galerina sideroides]]'' is found in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Michigan]], and Sweden, where it fruits in groups on rotten conifer logs. It has distinct microscopic characteristics, such as a wider range of basidial widths (20\u201340&nbsp;\u00b5m), and a lack of pleurocystidia.<ref name=\"Smith 1964\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Mythicomyces corneipes'' is a [[saprobic]] fungus, and uses plant debris\u2014usually bits of wood\u2014as a [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. Fruit bodies appear in autumn, and grow in groups among mosses in moist habitats, such as near the edges of bogs, or under conifers or birch in soil wet from spring flooding. It has been recorded from North America, where it is most common in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region, and Europe, where it is rare,<ref name=\"Redhead 1986\"/> but widespread across the northern part of the continent.<ref name=\"GTR 2003\"/> In 1938, Smith called the species \"extremely rare\".<ref name=\"Smith 1938\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Fries 1861\">{{cite journal |author=Fries EM. |year=1861 |title=Hymenomycetes novi vel minus cogniti, in Suecia 1852\u20131860 observati |journal=\u00d6fversigt Af Kongliga Vetenskaps-Akademiens F\u00f6rhandlingar  |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=19\u201334 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15376581 |language=Latin}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"GTR 2003\">{{cite report |title=Handbook to Additional Fungal Species of Special Concern in the Northwest Forest Plan.

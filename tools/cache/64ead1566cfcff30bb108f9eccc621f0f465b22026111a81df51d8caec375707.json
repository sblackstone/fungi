It was originally described under the name ''Pluteus michiganensis'' but [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular studies]] have placed it in the ''[[Volvopluteus]]'', a genus described in 2011. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of this mushroom is about {{convert|7|\u2013|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, gray, and has a cracked margin that is sticky when fresh. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] start out as white but they soon turn pink. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white and has a [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] at the base. Microscopical features and [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence data]] are of great importance for separating this [[taxon]] from related species. ''V.&nbsp;michiganensis'' is a [[saprotrophic]] fungus that was originally described as growing on [[sawdust]]. It has only been reported from [[Michigan]] (USA) and the [[Dominican Republic]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n|clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n|label1=\n|1={{clade\n    |1=''[[Volvopluteus gloiocephalus|V. gloiocephalus]]''\n    |2={{clade\n       |1=''[[Volvopluteus earlei|V. earlei]]''\n       |2={{clade\n          |1=''[[Volvopluteus asiaticus|V. asiaticus]]''\n          |2='''''V. michiganensis'''''\n          }}\n       }}\n   }}\n}}\n|caption=Phylogenetic relationships between ''Volvopluteus michiganensis'' and related species as inferred from [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] data.<ref name=\"Justo 2011b\"/>\n}}\nThis species was originally [[species description|described]] by American mycologist [[Alexander H. Smith]] in 1934 as ''Pluteus michiganensis'', based on collections made in [[Ann Arbor]] in October 1932.<ref name=\"Smith 1934\"/> In the original description there is no mention of a volva at the base of the stipe, one of the [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characters separating ''[[Pluteus]]'' from ''[[Volvopluteus]]''.<ref name=\"Justo 2011\"/> Smith did mention that \"the large spores are unusual for the genus ''Pluteus''\".<ref name=\"Smith 1934\"/> The species then disappeared from the mycological literature of the 20th century and Smith did not include his own species when he revised the [[Type (biology)|type collections]] of North American ''Pluteus''.<ref name=\"Smith 1958\"/> Morphological revision of the type and [[DNA sequence|DNA sequence data]] (based on [[Internal transcribed spacer]] sequences) obtained from the collection confirmed that this [[taxon]] belongs in the genus ''Volvopluteus'', and that it is a separate species from all the other members of that genus.<ref name=\"Justo 2011b\"/><ref name=\"Justo 2011\"/>\n\nThe [[botanical name|epithet]] ''michiganensis'' refers to the state of Michigan, where the fungus was originally described.<ref name=\"Smith 1934\"/> The original [[holotype]] specimens of this species are preserved at the [[University of Michigan Herbarium]].<ref name=\"Justo 2011\"/>\n\n==Description==\n\n===Macroscopic characters===\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''Volvopluteus michiganensis'' is between {{convert|7|and|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, more or less ovate or conical when young, then expands to convex or flat. It can have low, broad [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]] at center in old specimens; the surface is markedly viscid in fresh [[basidiocarps]] and covered with radially arranged fibrills; the cap is ash gray, similar to the color of ''[[Tricholoma terreum]]''. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded, free from the stipe, [[ventricose]], up to {{convert|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad; white when young turning pink with age. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|8|\u2013|11|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|\u2013|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, club-shaped with a bulbous base; the surface is white, smooth or [[tomentose]]. The [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] is sac-like, white and has a smooth surface. The [[Context (mycology)|context]] is white in the stipe and cap and it does not change when bruised or exposed to air. The smell was recorded as \"earthy, fragrant\"; the taste was not recorded. The [[spore print]] color was not recorded, but it is assumed to be pinkish-brown.<ref name=\"Justo 2011b\"/><ref name=\"Smith 1934\"/>\n\n===Microscopic characters===\nThe [[basidiospores]] are 10.5\u201313.5 by 6.5\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] with an [[ellipsoid]] shape. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are 35\u201355 by 10\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m, and four-spored. Pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill faces) are 70\u2013110 by 25\u201345&nbsp;\u00b5m, fusiform (spindle-shaped), utriform (shaped like a leather bottle) or lageniform (flask shaped); some have an apical excrescence (outgrowth). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 60\u201375 by 15\u201327&nbsp;\u00b5m, commonly fusiform or utriform; they cover completely the gill edge. The [[cap cuticle]] is an ixocutis (parallel [[hypha]]e embedded in a gelatinous matrix).<ref name=\"Vellinga 1988\"/> The [[Pellis|stipitipellis]] is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix).<ref name=\"Vellinga 1988\"/> Caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe surface) are sometimes present, and they are 100\u2013360 by 10\u201320&nbsp;\u00b5m and mostly cylindrical.<ref name=\"Justo 2011b\"/><ref name=\"Smith 1934\"/>\n\n<gallery widths=\"175px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Michiganensis pleurocystidia.jpg|<center>Pleurocystidia''</center>\nFile:Michiganensis cheilocystidia.jpg|<center>Cheilocystidia''</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===Ecology and distribution===\n''Volvopluteus michiganensis'' is a [[saprotrophic]] mushroom. The type collection was collected on sawdust.<ref name=\"Smith 1934\"/> The collections from the Dominican Republic were collected on piles of vegetable matter.<ref name=\"Angelini 2011\"/>\n\nThis species is only known from the [[type locality (biology)|type locality]] (Ann Arbor) and a second locality in the Dominican Republic. Morphologically, the Dominican collection matches the type collection well, but no molecular comparison has been performed.<ref name=\"Justo 2011b\"/><ref name=\"Smith 1934\"/><ref name=\"Angelini 2011\"/>\n\n==Similar species==\nMolecular analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in ''Volvopluteus'' but identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, presence or absence of cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus. ''Volvopluteus michiganensis'' is distinguished from other species of ''Volvopluteus'' by its relatively shorter spores, measuring on average less than 12.5&nbsp;\u00b5m long.<ref name=\"Justo 2011b\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Volvopluteus michiganensis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/Biolomics.aspx?Table=Mycobank&Page=200&ViewMode=Basic |title=''Volvopluteus michiganensis'' (Murrill) Vizzini, Contu & Justo 2011  |publisher=International Mycological Association |work=MycoBank |accessdate=2013-04-10}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Smith 1934\">{{cite journal |author=Smith AH. |title=New and unusual Agarics from Michigan |journal=Annales Mycologici |year=1934 |volume=32 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=471\u2013484 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59685/0032/005/0482.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Smith 1958\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith AH, Stuntz DE |title=Studies in the genus ''Pluteus'' I.

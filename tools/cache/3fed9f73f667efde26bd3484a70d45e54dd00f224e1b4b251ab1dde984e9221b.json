It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''field mushroom''' or, in North America, '''meadow mushroom'''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThis species was originally noted and named in 1753 by [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Agaricus campestris''.<ref name=\"Linnaeus 1753\"/> It was placed in the genus ''[[Psalliota]]'' by [[Lucien Quelet]] in 1872. Some variants have been isolated over the years, a few of which now have species status, for example, ''[[Agaricus bernardii]]'' Quel. (1878), ''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'' (J.E. Lange) Imbach (1946), ''[[Agaricus bitorquis]]'' (Quel.) Sacc. (1887), ''[[Agaricus cappellianus]]'' Hlavacek (1987), and ''[[Agaricus silvicola]]'' (Vittad.) Peck (1872). Some were so similar they did not warrant even [[variety (botany)|varietal]] status, while others have retained it. ''Agaricus campestris'' var. ''equestris''  (F.H.Moller) Pilat (1951) is still valid. ''A.&nbsp;campestris'' var. ''isabellinus'' (F.H.Moller) Pilat (1951), and ''A.&nbsp;campestris'' var. ''radicatus'', are possibly still valid too.\n\nThe [[Latin]] [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''campestris'' means \"of the fields\". [[Common name]]s given to the fungus include \"meadow mushroom\", \"pink bottom\",<ref name=\"Roody 2003\"/> and \"field mushroom\".\n\nAn analysis of ribosomal DNA of a limited number of members of the genus showed ''A. campestris'' to be an early offshoot in the genus and sister taxon to ''[[Agaricus cupreobrunneus|A. cupreobrunneus]]''.<ref name=Geml2004>{{cite journal |vauthors =Geml J, Geiser DM, Royse DJ |year=2004 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Agaricus'' species based on ITS and LSU rDNA sequences |journal=Mycological Progress |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=157\u201376 |doi=10.1007/s11557-006-0086-8}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is white, may have fine scales, and is {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in}} in diameter; it is first hemispherical in shape before flattening out with maturity. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially pink, then red-brown and finally a dark brown, as is the [[spore print]]. The {{convert|3|to|10|cm|in}} tall [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is predominantly white and bears a single thin ring.<ref name=\"Nilsson 1977\"/> The taste is mild. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] bruises a dingy reddish brown, as opposed to yellow in the inedible (and somewhat toxic) ''[[Agaricus xanthodermus]]'' and similar species. The thick-walled, elliptical [[spore]]s measure 5.5\u20138.0&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] by 4\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m. [[Cheilocystidia]] are absent.<ref name=\"Miller 2006\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nSeveral species may be confused with ''Agaricus campestris''. ''[[Amanita virosa]]'' and similar, closely related species,  are morbidly toxic. ''[[Agaricus xanthodermus]]'' (\"the yellow stainer\") causes gastrointestinal problems.\n''[[Agaricus arvensis]]'', the horse mushroom, is an excellent edible. White ''[[Clitocybe]]'' species that also grow on lawns, and in grassy places may be dangerous to eat.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Agaricus campestris'' is found in fields and grassy areas after rain from late summer onwards worldwide. It is often found on lawns in suburban areas. Appearing in small groups, in [[fairy rings]],<ref name=\"Fox 2006\"/> or solitary. Owing to the demise of horse-drawn vehicles, and the subsequent decrease in the number of horses on pasture, the old \"white outs\" of years gone by are becoming rare events.<ref name=\"Mabey 1972\"/> This species is rarely found in [[woodland]].\n\nThe mushroom has been reported from Asia, Europe, northern Africa, Australia<ref>{{cite book | author=J.

In flavor and texture, this mushroom is almost identical to the white button mushroom available in grocery stores in the United States. Among the similar species mentioned above, there have been cases (in fact the most common cause of fatal fungus poisoning in France) where the deadly toxic [[destroying angel]] (''Amanita bisporigera'') has been consumed by individuals who mistook it for this species. The edibility of specimens collected from lawns is uncertain because of possible contamination with pesticides or other chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Other uses==\nResearch into fungal dressings for the treatment of ulcers, and bed sores, using fungal mycelial filaments, is ongoing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the past, slices of ''A. campestris'' were applied to scalds and burns in parts of Scotland.<ref name=\"Harding 2008\"/>\n\n==Bioactive properties==\nWater extracts of ''A. campestris'' have been shown to enhance the secretion of [[insulin]], and to have insulin-like effects on [[glucose metabolism]] ''[[in vitro]]'', although the mechanism is not understood.<ref name=\"Gray 1998\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Agaricus species|List of ''Agaricus'' species]]\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Field Mushroom Gills.jpg|Field Mushroom Gills\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Alonso-Aguilar 2014\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Alonso-Aguilar LE, Montoya A, Kong A, Estrada-Torres A, Garibay-Orijel R |title=The cultural significance of wild mushrooms in San Mateo Huexoyucan, Tlaxcala, Mexico |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine |year=2014 |volume=10 |page=27 |pmid=24597704 |pmc=3996006 |doi=10.1186/1746-4269-10-27}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Fox 2006\">{{cite journal |author =Fox RTV |year=2006 |title=Fungal foes in your garden: fairy ring mushrooms |journal=Mycologist |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=36\u201337 |doi=10.1016/j.mycol.2005.11.013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gray 1998\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gray AM, Flatt PR |title=Insulin-releasing and insulin-like activity of ''Agaricus campestris'' (mushroom) |journal=The Journal of Endocrinology |volume=157 |issue=2 |pages=259\u201366 |year=1998 |pmid=9659289 |doi=10.1677/joe.0.1570259 |url=http://joe.endocrinology-journals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9659289|citeseerx=10.1.1.490.7952 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Grigson 1975\">{{cite book |author=Grigson J. |authorlink=Jane Grigson |title=The Mushroom Feast |year=1975 |publisher=Penguin |place=London, UK |isbn=978-0-14-046273-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomfeast00grig }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Harding 2008\">{{cite book |author=Harding P. |year=2008 |title=Mushroom Miscellany |publisher=Collins |isbn=978-0-00-728464-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Linnaeus 1753\">{{cite book |author=Linnaeus C. |title=Species Plantarum |year=1753 |publisher=Lars Salvius |location=Stockholm |volume=2 |page=1173 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/359194 |language=Latin}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Mabey 1972\">{{cite book |author=Mabey R. |year=1972 |title=Food For Free, A Guide to the Edible Wild Plants of Britain |publisher=Fontana/Collins}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Miller 2006\">{{cite book |vauthors=Miller HR, Miller OK Jr |title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi |publisher=Falcon Guides |location=Guilford, Connecticut |year=2006 |page=283 |isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Nilsson 1977\">{{cite book |vauthors=Nilsson S, Persson O |year=1977|title= Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi|publisher=Penguin, New York|isbn=978-0-14-063006-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Roberts 2011\">{{cite book |vauthors=Roberts P, Evans S |title=The Book of Fungi |year=2011 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=35 |isbn=978-0-226-72117-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Roody 2003\">{{cite book |author=Roody WC |title=Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |year=2003 |page=48 |isbn=978-0-8131-9039-6}}</ref>\n\n}}\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20090924133504/http://www.basidiochecklist.info/DisplayResults.asp?intGBNum=9779 British Checklist]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Agaricus campestris}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081202150115/http://mushroom-collecting.com/mushroomhorse.html Mushroom-Collecting.com]\n*[http://www.mushroomexpert.com/agaricus_campestris.html Mushroom Expert]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q234529}}\n\n[[Category:Agaricus|campestris]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Africa]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Australia]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]"}]}}}}

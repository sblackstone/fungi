The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], or [[mushroom]]s, have conic to bell-shaped to convex [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are initially dark brown but fade to brownish-gray when young, reaching diameters of up to {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are typically wrinkled or somewhat grooved, and have reddish-brown spots in age, or after being cut or bruised. The whitish to pale gray [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] also become spotted reddish-brown as they mature. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], up to {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and covered with whitish hairs at its base, can also develop reddish stains. The [[mycelium]] of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' has [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] properties. The [[saprobic]] fungus is found in Europe and North America, where it grows in groups or clusters on the rotting wood of both [[hardwood]]s and [[conifer]]s. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the fungus is unknown. Although the species is known for, and named after its propensity to stain reddish, occasionally these stains do not appear, making it virtually indistinguishable from ''[[Mycena galericulata|M.&nbsp;galericulata]]''.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe species was first [[species description|described scientifically]] by the German mycologist [[Petter Karsten]] in 1890.<ref name=Karsten1980/><ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena maculata\"/> The name ''Mycena maculata'' was also used by the Australian mycologist [[John Burton Cleland]] in 1934,<ref name=Cleland1934/> but that usage was considered illegitimate,<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena maculata Cleland\"/> and the species he described has since been renamed to ''[[Mycena austromaculata]]'' by Cheryl Grgurinovic and [[Tom May (mycologist)|Tom May]] in 1997.<ref name=Grgurinovic1997/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''maculata'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word \"spotted\".<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> The mushroom is commonly known as the \"reddish-spotted Mycena\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mycena maculata 60204.jpg|thumb|left|The whitish gills develop reddish-brown stains as they mature.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' varies in shape from broadly conic to convex initially, soon expanding to bell-shaped or broadly convex at maturity; when expanded the cap diameter is typically between {{convert|2|and|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. It usually has a distinct [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], which can be abruptly convex in some individuals and very broad and low in others. The cap margin closely approaches the stem when young, but often flares or curves upward with age. The cap surface is smooth, slimy to the touch, often opaque when young but becomes partially translucent so that the outlines of the gills underneath the cap may be seen nearly to the center, before fading. It is often somewhat wrinkled or has the radial gill grooves deepening with age. It is initially dirty blackish-brown or nearly black, becoming paler dirty brown to brownish-gray with age, and usually with reddish-brown spots. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is somewhat thick under the umbo, but becomes abruptly thinner over the area of the margin (about 0.15&nbsp;mm). It is [[wikt:cartilaginous|cartilaginous]] and firm, dark or pale watery gray, changing slowly to dirty reddish-brown when cut or bruised. It has no distinguishable odor, and a taste ranging from mild to slightly [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] (like flour).<ref name=\"Smith p.341-43\"/>\n\nThe [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are bluntly [[adnation|adnate]], later becoming toothed and somewhat [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]]. The gills are narrow, becoming moderately broad (4\u20135&nbsp;mm), whitish to pale gray in color, soon staining with reddish spots.  Sometimes the gills separate slightly from the cap, but remain attached to each other to form a collar. The gill spacing is close to subdistant, with about 17\u201324 gills reaching the stem; there are additionally about three tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The stem is usually {{convert|4|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, occasionally much longer, often with a long pseudorhiza (a cordlike structure resembling a plant root) {{convert|1|\u2013|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} that can root into the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. The stem is densely covered with sharp, stiff white hairs on the lower portion, and smooth above. It is sometimes twisted, nearly equal in width throughout, hollow, and cartilaginous. The top portion of the stem is pallid, while the remainder is the same color or paler than the cap. The stem base becomes stained reddish-brown to purplish, or the entire lower portion turns a dirty [[wine (color)|wine red]].<ref name=\"Smith p.341-43\">Smith, 1947, pp. 341\u201343.</ref> The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe spores are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] (meaning they turn bluish-black to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), and measure 7\u20139 by 4\u20135&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidium|basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are 30\u201335 by 7\u20138&nbsp;\u03bcm, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are embedded in the hymenium and inconspicuous, measuring 20\u201328 by 6\u201312&nbsp;\u03bcm. They are irregular in form; some have short rodlike projections on the upper part, others have irregular branched finger-like protuberances, while others have wavy walls and an elongated contorted apex. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) in ''Mycena maculata''. The gill tissue is [[hyaline]] or very faintly vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The cap tissue has a thin [[wikt:pellicle|pellicle]], and the region directly under it is made of hyphae with only slightly enlarged cells, while the remainder is filamentous, and stains yellowish to slightly vinaceous-brown in iodine.<ref name=\"Smith p.341-43\"/> The [[mycelium]] of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' is [[bioluminescent]];<ref name=Treu1990/> this property has not been reported for the fruit bodies.<ref name=Desjardin2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| align = right\n| image1 = Mycena galericulata 60303.jpg\n| width1 = 100\n| caption1 = ''M. galericulata''\n| image2 = Mycena haematopus 56359.jpg\n| width2 =177\n| caption2 = ''M. haematopus''\n}}\nIn the absence of the characteristic reddish staining (particularly in young specimens), ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' is indistinguishable in the field from ''[[Mycena galericulata|M.&nbsp;galericulata]]'', which also tends to grow in groups or [[wikt:tuft|tufts]] on wood. Microscopically, the latter species has larger spores, ranging from 8\u201312 by 5.5\u20139&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Ammirati2009/> Another ''Mycena'' that stains reddish is ''[[Mycena inclinata|M.&nbsp;inclinata]]''; it can be distinguished by its slightly larger spores, typically  7\u20139 by 5\u20136.5&nbsp;\u03bcm, and the white flecks that develop on the lower part of the stem. It is common in eastern North America, and prefers to grows on decaying hardwood.<ref>Smith, pp. 338\u201340.</ref> ''[[Mycena haematopus|M.&nbsp;haematopus]]'' also grows in clusters on wood, but can be differentiated by its scalloped cap margin, a stem which bleeds a reddish juice when cut or broken, and a preference for growing on hardwoods. ''[[Mycena purpureofusca|M.&nbsp;purpureofusca]]'' has a purplish cap, gills with purple edges, and usually grows on [[pine cones]].<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena maculata\"/> ''[[Mycena atrochalybaea|M.&nbsp;atrochalybaea]]'', a species known from Italy and Switzerland, has more gills that reach the stem (usually between 30 and 40), smooth hyphae in the cortical layer of the stem, and smooth, uninflated cystidia.<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe fruit bodies of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' grow in groups to clumps on the wood and debris of both [[coniferous]] and [[deciduous tree]]s.<ref name=\"Smith p.341-43\"/> The fungus is found in North America and Europe (Germany<ref name=Gerhardt1990/> and Norway<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/>).

This characteristic in combination with the annulus and absence of a bulb at the base of the stalk place this mushroom in the Section ''Caesareae''.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThis mushroom forms [[mycorrhizae]] with [[madrone]] (''Arbutus menziesii)'' in the southern part of its range (Central California northwards to Washington).  However, in the northern part of its range (Washington to southern Canada), its preferred host is [[Douglas fir]] ''(Pseudotsuga menziesii'').\n\n[[Image:Amanita capyotroderma group Oakland.JPG|right|thumb|''Amanita calyptroderma'' in Oakland, California]]\n\n==Edibility==\nExperienced mushroom hunters regard this mushroom as a good edible species, but caution must be exercised when collecting ''A. calyptroderma'' for the table, since it can be confused with other species in the genus ''Amanita''. This genus contains some of the deadliest mushrooms in the world, most notably ''[[Death cap|A. phalloides]]'' and ''[[Amanita ocreata|A. ocreata]]''.\n\n==Related Species==\n''[[Amanita vernicoccora]]'' is a closely related taxon which was previously referred to as the \"spring form\" of ''Amamita calyptroderma''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Amanita species]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+calyptroderma ''Amanita calyptroderma'' at Amanitaceae.org]\n*[http://www.bayareamushrooms.org/mushroommonth/coccora.html  ''Amanita calyptroderma'' at BayAreaMushrooms.org]\n*[http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Amanita_camyptroderma.html  ''Amanita calyptroderma'' at Mykoweb]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[http://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita_camyptroderma.html  ''Amanita calyptroderma'' at Mushroom Expert]\n\n{{Amanitas}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1947934}}\n\n[[Category:Amanita|calyptroderma]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]"}]}}}}

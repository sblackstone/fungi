It is commonly known as the '''collared earthstar''', the '''saucered earthstar''', or the '''triple earthstar'''\u2014and less commonly by the alternative species name ''Geastrum indicum''. It is the largest member of the [[genus]] ''Geastrum'' (or [[Geastrum|earthstar fungi]]) and expanded mature specimens can reach a tip-to-tip length of up to {{convert|12|cm|in|1|sp=us}}.\n\nImmature [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are spherical\u2014somewhat resembling [[puffball]]s with pointed beaks\u2014and are partially or completely buried in the ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exo[[peridium]]) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner [[spore]] sac. The spore sac contains the [[gleba]], a mass of spores and fertile [[Mycelium|mycelial]] tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits around the perimeter of the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the [[peristome]], which has a small hole from which [[basidiospore|spores]] may be released.\n\nThe species is widespread and can be found in Asia, Australasia, Europe, and both North and South America. The fungus has a history of use in the [[traditional medicine]]s of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native North America]] and China. Fruit bodies have been [[analytical chemistry|analyzed chemically]] to determine their [[lipid]] content, and various chemical [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of the fungal sterol [[ergosterol]] have been identified.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\n[[image:Junghuhn.jpg|thumb|150px|left|German botanist Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn|alt=Grainy black and white photograph showing the face and torso of an about 50-year-old bearded man looking into the camera. He is wearing a jacket, and collared shirt that appears to be buttoned only at the top.]]\nThe species was first described scientifically, by German botanist [[Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn]], as ''Geaster triplex'' in 1840. The earlier genus name ''Geaster'', introduced by Italian botanist [[Pier Antonio Micheli]] in 1727 in ''Nova Plantarum Genera'', is considered an [[orthographical variant]] of ''Geastrum''.<ref name=\"Demoulin1984\"/> Junghuhn, who was living in Indonesia and extensively surveyed its fungal flora, discovered the [[type (biology)|type specimen]] on [[Mount Gede|Mount Panggerangi]] on the island [[Java]], at an elevation between {{convert|3000|to|5000|ft|m}}. Today, the type specimen is kept at the [[National Herbarium of the Netherlands]] in [[Leiden]].<ref name=\"Sunhede1989\"/> The [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] feature used by Junghuhn to differentiate ''G.&nbsp;triplex'' from other similar earthstars was the collar-like structure of the inner layer of the exo[[peridium]].<ref name=\"Junghuhn1840\"/> American mycologist [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] would later erroneously suggest that the species was a \"giant form\" of ''[[Geastrum saccatum]]''.<ref name=\"Lloyd1907\"/>\n\nSeveral authors have regarded ''Geastrum indicum'' as the correct name for ''G.&nbsp;triplex''.<ref name=\"Smith1982\"/> This is because ''G.&nbsp;indicum''\u2014a species described by [[Johann Friedrich Klotzsch]] in 1832 as ''Cycloderma indicum''<ref name=\"Klotsch1832\"/> and then moved to Geastrum by [[Stephan Rauschert]] in 1959<ref name=\"Rauschert1959\"/><ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Geastrum indicum\"/>\u2014may be the same species as ''Geastrum triplex''. If it is in fact the same species, the first published name (i.e., ''G.&nbsp;indicum'') has [[binomial nomenclature|nomenclatorial]] priority according to the rules of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]. More recently, several authors argue that ''G.&nbsp;indicum'' should be rejected as a ''[[nomen dubium]]'' and ''G.&nbsp;triplex'' maintained as the correct name for the species.<ref name=\"Sunhede1989\"/><ref name=\"Dorfelt1984\"/><ref name=\"Dorfelt1987\"/><ref name=\"Mornard1993\"/>\n\nStellan Sunhede's 1989 [[monograph]] of European species of ''Geastrum'' follows V. J. Stan\u011bk's concept<ref name=\"Pilat1958\"/> for the infrageneric (below the level of genus) placement of ''Geastrum'', and places ''G.&nbsp;triplex'' with species that do not incorporate and encrust forest debris ([[section (biology)|section]] Basimyceliata). ''G.&nbsp;triplex'' is further categorized in subsection Laevistomata, which includes species with a fibrillose peristome\u2014that is, made of parallel, thin, thread-like filaments. Within subsection Laevistomata it is in [[wikt:stirp|stirps]] Triplex, due to its [[wikt:delimited|delimited]] (with a distinct restricting edge) or irregularly torn peristome.<ref name=\"Sunhede1989\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''triplex'' means \"threefold\", and refers to the three-layered [[peridium]].<ref name=\"Roody2003\"/> ''Geastrum triplex'' has acquired several [[common name|vernacular names]], including the collared earthstar,<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/><ref name=\"Phillips2006\"/> the saucered earthstar,<ref name=\"Arora1986\"/> and the triple earthstar.<ref name=\"Rogers2006\"/>\n\n==Description==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Geastrum triplex 55657.jpg|image2=Geastrum triplex 55663.jpg|width=200|caption1=The exoperidium splits to form a saucerlike platform that holds the endoperidium.|caption2=The upper surface of the rays may be divided into sections by cracks and fissures.|alt1=Overhead view of a tan to light brown fungus.

The surface of the ray is brown, and due to numerous cracks and fissures, has a pattern of block-like areas similar to cracked dried mud.}}\nLike all [[mushroom]]s, the [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of ''Geastrum triplex'' is the visible part of a larger organism. Hidden from sight are masses of nearly invisible fungal threads called [[mycelium]], which form the active feeding and growing structures of the fungus. The fruit body\u2014created when environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are optimal\u2014is designed to produce and disseminate [[spore]]s. ''Geastrum triplex'' has the largest fruit body of the [[Geastrum|earthstar]] mushrooms.<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> The immature fruit body is typically {{convert|1|to|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, and up to {{convert|8|to|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad (Roody gives a larger value here, up to 11.5&nbsp;cm)<ref name=\"Roody2003\"/> after the rays have spread out. It is composed of a roughly spherical to egg-shaped structure, the endoperidium, topped by an opening, the [[ostiole]], covered by fragments of tissue that form a small pointed beak (a peristome). The endoperidium is typically lacking any sort of stem (it is [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]]) grayish brown to \"wood brown\" when young but light yellow-brown in dried, unopened specimens. The outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, develops splits which radiate from the apex and form between four and eight rays that separate from the endoperidium. The latter's thin and papery envelope surrounds a mass of spores and fertile tissue known as the [[gleba]]. The central part of the gleba contains a pseudocolumella (a [[sporangium#Internal structures|columella]] not attached to the stalk), that is typically cylindrical or club-shaped, and extends up from the base. Because of the variability in columella persistence, size, structure and shape within the genus, its value for identification is limited.<ref name=\"Bates2004\"/>\n\nThe exoperidium's rays are {{convert|2|to|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and up to 4&nbsp;mm (3/16 in) thick.<ref name=\"Foy1991\"/> The outer surface of the rays (the lower surface, after expansion) and unopened specimens have a rough texture. In several ''Geastrum'' species, dirt and debris adhere to the underside, this is not the case in ''G.&nbsp;triplex''. The inner fleshy layers (upper surface) of these rays are near \"wood brown\" in color when dried, and have a layer of surface tissue that cracks into patches. There is a great deal of variation, however, to the extent in which the upper surface tissue of the rays crack: this tissue layer may also remain closely attached as a sheet over the unsegmented part of the outer wall with the part adhering to the rays variously cracked and sometimes finally peeling off in places.<ref name=\"Smith1951\"/>\n\nIn ''G.&nbsp;triplex'', the bases of the rays usually break around the perimeter of the endoperidium to form a saucerlike platform or receptacle in which the endoperidium rests. However, not all specimens form this receptacle, leading to possible confusion with other ''Geastrum'' species. [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] claimed that in tropical regions, with an abundance of high temperatures and humidity, the fungus expands rapidly, which is more conducive to the fleshy layer breaking away to form a receptacle; in more [[temperate]] areas this effect would not be as pronounced and \"usually does not occur at all\".<ref name=\"Lloyd1907\"/>\n\nThe endoperidium is {{convert|1|to|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter by {{convert|0.9|to|2.0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} high,<ref name=\"Miller2006\"/> sessile, and a dull grayish brown. The peristome is made of radially arranged fibrils that clump together at the apex in groups of unequal length to form an opening that appears jagged or torn.<ref name=\"Smith1951\"/> The circular area bordering the peristome is a paler color. Spores are thought to be dispersed by the wind sucking them out when it blows over the hole, or when falling raindrops hit the flexible endoperidium, creating a puff of air that forces the spores through the ostiole.<ref name=\"Kibby1994\"/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n[[image:Geastrum triplex 55660.jpg|thumb|left|Basidiospores are spherical, 3.5\u20134.5&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, and covered with warts.|alt=About two dozen round objects that are brownish and translucent, and covered with small bumps. What appear to be the gradation lines of a ruler run horizontally through the middle of the image.]]\nThe spore sac contains the [[gleba]], which is composed of a pseudocolumella, unbranched threads (the [[capillitia|capillitium]]), the spore-bearing cells ([[basidia]]) and the [[basidiospore|spores]] themselves;<ref name=\"Ellis1990\"/> all of these microscopic elements have certain characteristic features that help distinguish ''G.&nbsp;triplex'' from other superficially similar earthstars.\n\nThe spores are spherical, and 3.5\u20134.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] in diameter. They are covered with short narrow abruptly terminating projections of a translucent ([[hyaline]]) substance, which turn a pale cinnamon brown in [[potassium hydroxide]], and a dark dull brown (nearly [[sepia (color)|sepia]]) when stained with [[iodine]]. The capillitium is made of what appears to be encrusted cylindrical filaments 3\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, of a color varying from hyaline to dull yellowish brown in [[potassium hydroxide]], and yellowish in [[iodine]]; its walls are thickened to the point where the interior ([[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]) appears as only a line.<ref name=\"Smith1951\"/> Either two or four spores are attached to the basidia, and the [[sterigmata]] (extensions of the basidia that attach the spores) are long, up to 20&nbsp;\u00b5m.

However, it is larger than either of these species.<ref name=\"Healy2008\"/> The combination of characteristics which distinguish ''G.&nbsp;triplex'' from other earthstars include the lack of debris adhering to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it from the rest of the endoperidium.<ref name=\"Smith1951\"/> Unlike some other ''Geastrum'' species, the rays of ''G.&nbsp;triplex'' are not [[hygroscopic]]: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.<ref name=\"Arora1986\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[Image:GeastrumTriplexComp.png|thumb|right|Stages of fruit body emergence|alt=Six star-shaped fungi arranged in a semicircle on the ground.

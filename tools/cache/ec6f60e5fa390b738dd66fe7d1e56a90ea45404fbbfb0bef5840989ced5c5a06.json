It is [[saprobic]] on wood, like other ''[[Crepidotus]]'' species, but it can also decompose [[herbaceous]] forest litter.

It is attached [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsally]] or [[Lateral (anatomy)|laterally]]  to the substrate. Fan- or kidney-shaped, it is dry, white, and covered with a layer of soft hairs which may or may not be matted. The outer edge is rolled slightly inwards. The [[Trama (mycology)|context]] is thin, soft, and white. Both the odor and taste of this mushroom are mild.\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] radiate from an eccentric or lateral point of attachment, medium broad, and tend to swell in the middle. The gill spacing is sub-distant, with many short gills (lamellulae) that do not reach the attachment point. The gills are initially white, then later tinged a rusty-brown color. The spore print is cinnamon-brown in color.<ref name=\"isbn0-02-063690-3\">{{cite book |author1=Sundberg, Walter |author2=Bessette, Alan |title=Mushrooms: A Quick Reference Guide to Mushrooms of North America (Macmillan Field Guides) |publisher=Collier Books |location=New York |year=1987 |page=54 |isbn=0-02-063690-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThis species has no [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], although it may have a small [[tubercle]] attaching it to its growing surface.\n\n===Microscopic features===\n\nThe [[basidiospore]]s  are 7\u201311 x 4.5\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] in size, ellipsoid in shape, marked with very small spots, and yellowish to yellowish-brown under microscopic view. [[Basidia]] are 27\u201332 x 6\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m and 4-spored. [[Pleurocystidia]] are absent. The [[cheilocystidia]] are 22\u201363 x 3\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m, cylindric, and either swelling in the middle, or bottle-shaped. The gill trama are interwoven or at times subparallel, the [[hypha]]e 4\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter. The generative tissue below the hymenium (subhymenium) is arranged in a parallel fashion. The cuticle (the outer layer of the fruiting body) is made of dense interwoven hyphae, connected to a tuft of colorless, long, slender (2.5\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m diameter) hyphae. There are no [[clamp connection]]s in the epicuticular hyphae, but there are on the hyphae of the tomentum at the base of the pileus.\n\n(Description adapted from Hesler & Smith, 1965<ref>Hesler LR, Smith AH.

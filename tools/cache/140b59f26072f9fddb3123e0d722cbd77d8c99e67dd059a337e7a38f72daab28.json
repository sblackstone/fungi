One of several species similar in appearance, it is a small white [[funnel]]-shaped [[toadstool]] widely found in lawns, meadows and other grassy areas in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Also known as the '''sweating mushroom''', it derives this name from the symptoms of poisoning. It contains potentially deadly levels of [[muscarine]].\n\n==Description==\nA small whitish mushroom, the 3\u20134&nbsp;cm diameter [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is funnel-shaped with decurrent crowded white gills, with specks of pink. The fibrous [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is up to 4&nbsp;cm tall and bears no ring. The [[spore print]] is white. There is no distinctive taste or smell. It is one of a number of similar poisonous species, which can be confused with the edible fairy ring champignon (''[[Marasmius oreades]]'')<ref name=\"Carluccio03\">{{cite book | author = [[Antonio Carluccio|Carluccio A]] | year = 2003 | title = The Complete Mushroom Book | publisher = Quadrille | isbn = 1-84400-040-0}}</ref> or miller (''[[Clitopilus prunulus]]''), such as the ivory funnel (''[[Clitocybe dealbata]]'') .<ref>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page= 98}}</ref>\n\nWhen young and imbued with moisture, as with a small group of related ''Clitocybes ''such as ''C. phyllophila,  ''the cap has a distinctive brownish translucent aspect with a \"frosting\" of white (which however is not superficial, but part of the flesh).  When it dries out it becomes uniform pure white, and it is more difficult to identify.  Thus it is [[hygrophanous]] in a way, but not to be confused with the smaller thin-fleshed ''Clitocybe'' species which are commonly characterized as hygrophanous.<ref name=Funga>{{cite book |last=Knudsen |first=Henning |author2=Jan Vesterhout |title=Funga Nordica |publisher=Nordsvamp |location=Copenhagen |year=2008 |page=392}}  As in other keys which could be used as references, the frosted appearance of the cap described in the article is used to distinguish this group of ''Clitocybes''.</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nIt was initially described as ''Agaricus rivulosus'' by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801,<ref>{{cite book | last = Persoon | first = Christian Hendrik | title = Synopsis Methodica Fungorum | year = 1801 | publisher = H.

If distinguished, it is on the basis that build is more robust, the gills are less decurrent and the margin has a tendency to crack up.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kuyper |first=Thomas W. |title=Some taxonomic and nomenclatural changes in the Tricholomataceae, tribus Clitocybeae |journal=Persoonia |volume=16\u20132 |year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book  | last = Bon | first = Marcel | title = Flore mycologique d'Europe 4 Les clitocybes, omphales et ressemblants | publisher = M.

With large doses, these symptoms may be followed by [[Abdomen|abdominal]] pain, severe [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], blurred vision, and labored breathing. Intoxication generally subsides within two hours. [[Death]] is rare, but may result from [[cardiac failure|cardiac]] or [[respiratory failure]] in severe cases. The specific [[antidote]] is [[atropine]].<ref name=\"Benjamin95\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of deadly fungi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic2863.htm Toxicity, Mushrooms \u2013 Muscarine]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2720076}}\n\n[[Category:Clitocybe|rivulosa]]\n[[Category:Deadly fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi found in fairy rings]]\n[[Category:Poisonous fungi]]"}]}}}}

Commonly known as the Golden Wood Fungus.\n\n==Description==\n'''Australia:''' Gymnopilus allantopus is extremely common in the [[Perth]] region, most often seen on fallen [[Banksia]] logs and branches. It is a decomposer fungus occurring on a wide range of rotting logs, stumps and woody debris. The Golden Wood Fungus produces fruit bodies over most of the main local Australian fungus season \u2013 May to July, and also produces masses of fan-like white thread in the wood that can be seen any time of the year. The best way to see the fans is to lift off a strip of [[Bark (botany)|bark]] to reveal the underlying threads amid the soft white-rotted wood.\n\nThe fungus is easily identified in the field by its bright gills that develop rusty spots when old, white flap on the margin of young caps, and white fan-like mycelium. It has a bright ochre brown spore print. Most often the fruit bodies have a straight stem but if the specimens emerge from the side of a log the stem curves upwards.<ref>Bougher, N. L. (2009).

It was also recently given the provisional name G. austrosapineus to distinguish small specimens from large ones sent in the 19th century from Australia to M. J. Berkeley in [[England]]. He named the large specimens as allantopus in 1845 and referred to it as the very noble species. Recent studies have revealed that Berkeley was sent only the largest specimens and he had wrongly assumed all specimens would be large-sized. Hence the name G. austrosapineus was determined to be superfluous because G. allantopus produces both small and large specimens.<ref>Bougher, N. L. (2009).

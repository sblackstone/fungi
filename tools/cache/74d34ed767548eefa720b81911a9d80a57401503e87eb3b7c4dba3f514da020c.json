Like the two other members of its genus, it lives on the decomposing remains of other fleshy [[mushroom]]s. The fungus produces small whitish [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide held by thin [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long. On the underside of the cap are closely spaced white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that are broadly attached to the stem. At the base of the stem, embedded in the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] is a small reddish-brown [[sclerotium]] that somewhat resembles an apple seed. The appearance of the sclerotium distinguishes it from the other two species of ''Collybia'', which are otherwise very similar in overall appearance. ''C.&nbsp;tuberosa'' is found in Europe, North America, and Japan, growing in dense clusters on species of ''[[Lactarius]]'' and ''[[Russula]]'', [[bolete]]s, [[hydnum]]s, and [[polypore]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming==\n\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n| clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n| label1=\n| 1={{clade\n     |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n             |1={{clade\n                |1='''''Collybia tuberosa'''''\n                |2=''[[Collybia cookei]]''\n                }}\n             |2=''[[Collybia cirrhata]]''\n             }}\n         |2=''[[Clitocybe dealbata]]''\n         }}\n     |2={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n            |1=''[[Dendrocollybia racemosa]]''\n            |2=''[[Clitocybe connata]]''\n            }}\n        |2=''[[Hypsizygus ulmarius]]''\n        |3=''[[Lepista nuda]]''\n        }}\n     }}\n}}\n| caption=Phylogeny and relationships of ''C.&nbsp;tuberosa'' and closely related fungi based on [[ribosomal DNA]] sequences.<ref name=Hughes2001/>\n}}\n\nThe species was first described under the name ''Agaricus tuberosus'' by the French naturalist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Jean Bulliard]] in the 6th volume of his ''Herbier de la France'' (1786).<ref name=Bulliard1786/> [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] called it ''Agaricus amanitae'' [[subspecies|subsp.]] ''tuberosus'' in his 1799 publication ''Observationes Mycologicae'',<ref name=Persoon1799/> while [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] referred it to ''[[Gymnopus]]'' in 1821.<ref name=Gray1821/> It was transferred to ''[[Collybia]]'' by [[Paul Kummer]] in 1886.<ref name=Kummer1871/> The species has also been called ''Microcollybia tuberata'' in a 1979 publication by Joanne Lennox,<ref name=Lennox1979/> but the genus ''Microcollybia'' has since been folded into ''Collybia''.<ref name=Kirk2008/> Additional [[synonym (taxonomy)|taxonomic synonyms]] include ''Marasmius sclerotipes'' Bres. 1881, ''Chamaeceras sclerotipes'' (Bres.)

Sometimes the cap margin is pleated or grooved. The center of the cap is pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]] but whitish around the margin, and it becomes whitish overall as it matures.

The gill spacing is close to subdistant, and the individual gills are whitish to pinkish-buff, thin, narrow to moderately broad, and have straight edges. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|10|\u2013|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|\u2013|2|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, and roughly equal in width throughout its length. It is slender and thread-like, flexible and pliant, with a dry surface. The top of the stem is covered with scales or a fine whitish powder, while the lower portion has hairs ranging from delicate to coarse. The color of the stem is generally whitish to pinkish-buff, but it darkens after it has been handled. The stem interior is [[pith]]y, and becomes hollow with age. The stems originate from a dark reddish-brown [[sclerotium]] of variable shape, typically measuring {{convert|3|\u2013|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|\u2013|5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}. The surface of the sclerotium is initially smooth, but later becomes wrinkled or furrowed; its interior is solid and white.<ref name=\"urlHalling\"/> It is often compared to an apple seed in appearance.<ref name=McKnight1987/><ref name=Arora1986/> Typically, several sclerotia are connected by thin strands of [[mycelium|mycelia]].<ref name=McKnight1987/> The sclerotium is a resting structure that allows to fungus to overwinter in its host.<ref name=\"urlTom Volk's FTOM June 2004\"/> In 1915, [[William Murrill]] reported the sclerotia of ''C.&nbsp;tuberosa'' to be [[bioluminescent]].<ref name=Murrill1915/>\n\nThe [[spore print]] is white.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> Individual [[spore]]s are smooth, [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to tear-shaped in profile, [[wikt:obovoid|obovoid]] to ellipsoid or cylindric in face or back view, with dimensions of 4.2\u20136.2 by 2.8\u20133.5[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. They are [[inamyloid]] and [[wikt:acyanophilous|acyanophilous]] (non-reactive to [[staining]] with [[Melzer's reagent]] and [[Methyl blue]], respectively). The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are club-shaped to cylindric and 15.4\u201321 by 3.5\u20135&nbsp;\u03bcm. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are scattered to infrequent, inconspicuous, and 17.5\u201331.5&nbsp;\u03bcm long. Their shape ranges from a contorted cylinder to roughly club-shaped to irregularly diverticulate (with short offshoots approximately at right angles to the main stem). There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue is made of interwoven hyphae that are non-reactive to Melzer's reagent. These hyphae are smooth and thin-walled, measuring 2.8\u20136.4&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. The cap tissue is made of hyphae that is interwoven below the center of the cap, radially oriented over the gills, and inamyloid.

The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a thin layer of smooth thin-walled hyphae that are more or less radially oriented, bent-over, cylindric and somewhat gelatinous, measuring 2\u20135&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter; they are occasionally diverticulate. The cuticle of the stem is made of a layer of parallel, vertically oriented smooth, thin-walled hyphae that are 2\u20134.2&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter, pale yellowish brown in alkali mounting solution. The stem has moderately thin-walled and smooth cystidia that are resemble [[wikt:flexuous|flexuous]] or contorted cylinders. They are [[hyaline]] in alkali, and 3.5\u20137&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter.

''C.&nbsp;cookei'' has roughly spherical, light brown to yellowish sclerotia, while ''C.&nbsp;cirrhata'' does not produce sclerotia.<ref name=\"urlHalling\"/> In the field, ''C.&nbsp;tuberosa'' may be distinguished from ''C.&nbsp;cookei'' by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> A [[optical microscope|microscope]] provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of ''C.&nbsp;cookei'' are rounded, while those of ''C.&nbsp;tuberosa'' are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species.<ref name=Komorowska2000/> In contrast, ''[[Collybia cirrhata|C.&nbsp;cirrhata]]'' does not produce sclerotia.<ref name=Bessette2007/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nIt is not known if ''C.&nbsp;tuberosa'' is strictly [[parasitism|parasitic]], and needs the [[host (biology)|host]] to be living, or whether it is [[saprobic]].<ref name=\"urlTom Volk's FTOM June 2004\"/> Either way, the fruit bodies of the fungus are found growing solitarily or in dense clusters on the decomposing, often blackened remains of other mushrooms. Hosts include [[Agaricales|agarics]] (particularly ''[[Lactarius]]'' and ''[[Russula]]''),<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> [[bolete]]s, [[hydnum]]s, and [[polypore]]s.<ref name=\"urlHalling\"/> In the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the United States, ''[[Russula crassotunicata]]'' is a common and abundant species that has been definitively identified as a host of both ''C.&nbsp;tuberosa'' and ''[[Dendrocollybia racemosa]]''. The ''Russula'' fruit bodies are slow to decay, and are available nearly year-round as a substrate for the saprobes. Based on field observations, the authors suggest that ''C.&nbsp;tuberosa'' may produce fruit bodies on less decayed mushrooms, while ''D.&nbsp;racemosa'' produces them on much more heavily decayed mushrooms.<ref name=Machnicki2006/>\n\n''Collybia tuberosa'' is found in Europe and North America,<ref name=\"urlRogers\"/> and in most common in the summer and autumn, coinciding with the fruiting

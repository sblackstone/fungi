Originally described from Japan, it is now also known in Northern India, Thailand, and Nepal. It is quite a common species in southern China and is sold in free markets, along with the similar mushroom, ''[[Amanita manginiana]]''. It differs only slightly by having more abundant inflated cells of its [[volva (mycology)|volva]], and its ellipsoid to broad ellipsoid [[spore]]s.<ref name=Tulloss/>\n\nThere has been a case of [[nephrotoxin]] poisoning, including delayed onset acute [[kidney failure]] associated with the ingestion of this mushroom, in a 66-year-old man with [[diabetes]]. Effects occurred similar to that of the intoxication symptoms associated with the North American species ''[[Amanita smithiana]]'' and the Mediterranean ''[[Amanita proxima]]''. Kidney [[biopsy]] of the patient showed acute tubular necrosis with glomerular minor abnormalities. Treatment included a three-week period of [[haemodialysis]], after which the patient fully recovered from the acute kidney failure in two months.<ref name=Iwafuchi2003/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Iwafuchi2003>{{cite journal |vauthors=Iwafuchi Y, Morita T, Kobayashi H, Kasuga K, Ito K, Nakagawa O, Kunisada K, Miyazaki S, Kamimura A |title=Delayed onset acute renal failure associated with ''Amanita pseudoporphyria'' Hongo ingestion |journal=Internal Medicine |year=2003 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=78\u201381 |pmid=12583624 |doi=10.2169/internalmedicine.42.78}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Tulloss>{{cite web |author =Tulloss R |title=''Amanita pseudoporphyria'' |url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+pseudoporphyria |work=Amanitaceae.org |accessdate=2012-02-25}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IndexFungorum|292458}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q4739882}}\n\n[[Category:Amanita|pseudoporphyria]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1957]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Poisonous fungi]]"}]}}}}

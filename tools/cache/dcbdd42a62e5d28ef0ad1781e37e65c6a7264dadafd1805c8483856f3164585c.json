It is a [[monotypic taxon|monotypic]] genus and consists of the single [[mushroom]] species '''''Rhodotus palmatus''''', known in the [[common name|vernacular]] as the '''netted rhodotus''', the '''rosy veincap''', or the '''wrinkled peach'''. This uncommon species has a [[Circumboreal Region|circumboreal]] distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in over half of the European fungal [[Red List]]s of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting [[hardwood]]s, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and veined surface of their rubbery [[pileus (mycology)|caps]]; variations in the color and quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruit bodies]].\n\nThe unique characteristics of ''R.&nbsp;palmatus'' have made it difficult for [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] to agree on how it should be [[classification (biology)|classified]], resulting in an elaborate taxonomical history and an extensive [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]]. First named ''Agaricus palmatus'' by [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Bulliard]] in 1785, it was reclassified into several different genera before becoming ''Rhodotus'' in 1926. The [[family (biology)|familial]] placement of the genus ''Rhodotus'' within the order [[Agaricales]] has also been subject to dispute, and the [[taxon]] has been transferred variously to the families [[Amanitaceae]], [[Entolomataceae]], and [[Tricholomataceae]]. More recently, [[molecular phylogenetics]] analysis has helped determine that ''Rhodotus'' is most closely related to genera in the [[Physalacriaceae]].\n\n==History and etymology==\nThe [[type species]] of genus ''Rhodotus'' was originally described as ''Agaricus palmatus'' in 1785 by French botanist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Jean Bulliard]];<ref name=\"Bulliard1785\">{{cite book |title=Herbier de la France|author=Bulliard JBF.|year=1785|location=France|page=plate 216|url=https://archive.org/stream/herbierdelafranc193240bull#page/n47/mode/1up}}</ref> mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] later included it under the same name in his ''Systema Mycologicum''.<ref name=\"Fries1821\">{{cite book|title=Systema Mycologicum|author=Fries E.

Consequently, [[phenotype|phenotypic]] variations observed in the field\u2014such as size, shape, and cap color\u2014may be influenced by differing conditions of light color and intensity. For example, specimens grown in the laboratory under green light had fruit bodies with short, straight stems and pale orange, large caps with well-developed ridges and pits, an appearance similar to specimens found in the field that were growing under a canopy of green leaves. Laboratory-grown specimens under [[amber]] light had bright orange, small caps with less pronounced [[wikt:reticulation|reticulations]]; similarly, field specimens found in the fall, after the leaves had fallen, were more orange to orange-pink in color.<ref name=Miller1980>{{cite journal|author1=Miller OK Jr |author2=Palmer JG |author3=Gillman LS. |year=1980|title=The fruiting and development of ''Rhodotus palmatus'' in culture|journal=Mycotaxon|volume=11|issue=2|pages=409\u201319}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation status==\n[[File:Rhodotus palmatus1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|alt=A group of three convex red-pink objects with a network of lighter-colored whitish or light pink ridges on the surface, clustered together and growing out of the side of a log.|Fruit bodies can grow singly, or in clusters.]]\nIn the 1980s in Europe, increases in the levels of [[air pollution]], as well as changing [[Land use, land-use change and forestry|land use]] practices coincided with reports of declines in the populations of certain mushrooms.

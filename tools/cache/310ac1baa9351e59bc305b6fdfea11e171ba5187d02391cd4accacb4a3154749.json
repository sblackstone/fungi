It is found frequently in deciduous and coniferous forests of [[Europe]], and possibly North America.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n''Amanita fulva'' was first described by [[Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer]] in 1774.<ref name=IndexFungorum/> Historically, both the tawny grisette and the grisette (''[[Amanita vaginata|A. vaginata]]'') were placed in the genus ''[[Amanitopsis]]'' due to their lack of a ring, unlike other ''[[Amanita]]'' species. However this distinction is now seen as insufficient to warrant a separate genus. Nowadays, ''A. fulva'' and similar ringless species of ''Amanita'' are placed in the section ''[[List of Amanita species#Section Vaginatae|Vaginatae]]'' ss according to the classification of [[Cornelis Bas|Bas]].<ref name=Fraiture/>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n   | align     = left\n   | width     = 100\n   | footer    = Maturation of ''A. fulva'' in three stages - an emergent (far left), an immature (middle) and a mature specimen (right).

It is generally found with [[oak]] (''Quercus''), [[birch]] (''Betula''), [[spruce]] (''Picea''), [[pine]] (''Pinus''), [[chestnut]] (''Castanea'') and [[alder]] (''Alnus''), with which it forms [[mycorrhiza]]e. It is often found with birch in Scandinavia, while collections from southern Europe are usually from forests of oak, chestnut and pine.<ref name=Fraiture>{{cite book | author = Fraiture A.  | year = 1993 | title = Les Amanitopsis d'Europe | language = French | publisher = Jardin Botanique Nationale de Belgique | pages = 75\u20138 | isbn = 90-72619-09-9 | issn = 0775-9592}}</ref> It grows in acidic soils and fruits from summer to late autumn (May to November in the UK).

Though this particular species is considered edible, it must be identified with care as other members of the genus ''Amanita'' are poisonous and some are deadly.

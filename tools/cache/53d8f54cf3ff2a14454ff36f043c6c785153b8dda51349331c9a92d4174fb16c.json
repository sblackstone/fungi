The small, inconsequentially edible mushroom has a bright yellow, conical to broadly convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is tough and thin, up to {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall, bright yellow at the top becoming progressively  orange towards the base. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate, subdistant, and yellowish, becoming lighter in age; and the [[spore print]] is white. This mushroom is [[saprobic]] and found exclusively on hickory nuts and walnuts in eastern North America. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''crocea'' refers to the orange color. The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"walnut mycena\" and was previously and commonly misidentified as ''Mycena luteopallens''.<ref name=MaasG_1991/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is vivid yellow, conical to broadly convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and up to {{convert|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. When young the cap tends to be conical or bell-shaped becoming plane or flat at maturity. The margin is striated.  The surface is moist, glabrous, and somewhat [[hygrophanous]]. The flesh is thin, pallid, and yellowish. Odor and taste are not distinctive. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an adnate attachment and are a pale yellowish color. They are subdistantly spaced.  The sturdy [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|10|to|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|to|1.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick.  The stipe is central, equal (i.e., roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom), and dark orange to yellowish<ref name=MaasG_1991/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are 7\u20139 x 4\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m, smooth, and elliptical, and weakly amyloid to inamyloid. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are present<ref name=MaasG_1991/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Mycena strobilinoides]]'' is similar to ''M.&nbsp;crocea'', but is found in needle beds under conifers.  ''[[Atheniella adonis]]'' has a fragile stem and a more reddish-pink coloration.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Mycena crocea'' are found exclusively on hickory nuts and walnuts in eastern North America.

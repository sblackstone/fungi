The [[spore]]s of ''D. perlata'' are quite similar to those of mushrooms in the genus ''[[Gyromitra]]'', so that some [[mycologist]]s classify it there.  It is considered an edible but like with all mushrooms that are collected in the wild must be not only properly identified, but also caution should be taken against possible accidental poisoning or allergic reactions.\n\n== Description ==\nThe cup measures 1\u215d - 4 in. (4 \u2013 10&nbsp;cm) wide; with a disc-like, whitish exterior, and a dark brown to tan interior.  The cup is often wrinkled to convoluted, with the edges turned downward.  The flesh is brittle.  The stipe (when present) is \u00bc - \u215c in. (0.5 \u2013 1&nbsp;cm.) long and thick; it is brownish-tan in color.\n\n=== Microscopic characteristics ===\nThe spores are 30 - 35 x 12 - 14 \u03bcm; Spindle shaped, minutely warted, with 3 oil drops and knobs at each end, located in the cup.\n\n=== Edibility ===\nIt is edible however with caution.\n\n=== Similar species ===\n''[[Disciotis venosa]]'' is more deeply veined, and has smooth spores; it is typically found in deciduous woods.  Other similar species of ''[[Discina (fungus)|Discina]]'' must be differentiated microscopically.\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nIt is found singularly or in groups, on [[humus]] or rotten wood in [[coniferous]] areas; near melting snowbanks in western mountains. Its range is from Northeastern United States, Northwestern United States, and California.  It comes into fruiting from May\u2013July.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*  [[Gary Lincoff|Lincoff, GH]] ''National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms.''

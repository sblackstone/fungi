''brunneum'' was also elevated to species status as ''Chlorophyllum brunneum''. ''Chlorophyllum olivieri'' is a closely related species that is also eaten as the \"Shaggy Parasol.\"\n\nMany reference works spell the epithet \"''rachodes''\" rather than \"''rhacodes''\". The spelling \"rachodes\" was used by [[Carlo Vittadini|Vittadini]] when he first published the species in 1835, but was erroneous as the Greek word ''rhakos'' 'piece of cloth' should be transcribed as ''rhacos''.  However [[Index Fungorum]] keeps to the original author's spelling \"''rachodes''\" and so that is the form which should be regarded as correct.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=257410 |title=''Chlorophyllum rachodes'' page |work=Species Fungorum |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=2017-05-22}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe shaggy parasol is a large and conspicuous [[agaric]], with thick brown [[scale (zoology)|scales]] and protuberances on its fleshy white [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] and [[spore print]] are both white in colour. Its [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is slender, but bulbous at the base, is coloured uniformly and bears no patterns. It is fleshy, and a reddish, or [[Maroon (color)|maroon]] discoloration occurs and a pungent odour is evolved when it is cut. The [[egg (biology)|egg]]-shaped caps become wider and flatter as they mature.\n\nThe stipe of ''C. rhacodes'' grows to {{convert|10|to|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} tall and has a [[diameter]] of 1 to 2 centimetres. The cap grows to {{convert|7.5|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} across,\n\n==Edibility==\n[[File:Macrolepiota rhacodes JPG3.jpg|thumb|left|'' Chlorophyllum rhacodes ''|250px]]\n\nThe shaggy parasol is popularly praised as a choice [[edible mushroom]]. However, it contains [[toxins]] which can cause [[gastric upset]]s when eaten [[raw food|raw]] or undercooked, and some individuals show a strong allergic response even after cooking.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nFurthermore, young shaggy parasols look identical to the poisonous ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'' (the mushroom that causes the most poisonings in North America yearly).<ref>[http://www.mushroomexpert.com/chlorophyllum_molybdites.html Chlorophyllum molybdites] (MushroomExpert.com)</ref> Checking the spore print is ''essential'' as ''C. molybdites' '' print is green (older specimens have slightly green gills). As a result, this mushroom is '''not recommended''' for inexperienced hunters.\n\n==Similar species==\nThe shaggy parasol is similar in appearance to the similarly edible [[parasol mushroom]], ''Macrolepiota procera''. The latter grows considerably larger however, and is more likely to be found in the open than ''C. rhacodes'' which prefers more [[shade (shadow)|shade]] and dislikes open [[pastures]] and [[Field (agriculture)|fields]]. Another distinguishing feature is that ''C. rhacodes'' lacks the brown bands that are on the stem of ''M. procera''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Chlorophyllum rhacodes}}\n* Collins Gem Guide: Mushrooms and Toadstools, [[Stefan Buczacki]] 1982.\n* The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, Knopf Publishing\n* The Mushroom Book, Thomas L\u00e6ss\u00f8e & [[Anna Del Conte]], Dorling Kindersley, 1996.\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q757119}}\n\n[[Category:Agaricaceae]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi found in fairy rings]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Australia]]\n[[Category:Fungi native to Australia]]\n[[Category:Fungi naturalized in Australia]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]"}]}}}}

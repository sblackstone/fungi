It inhabits most of eastern [[North America]], primarily east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and in season during the summer and fall months but can be found across the globe in China and Nepal. Its fruit body, the [[mushroom]], is classed as medium or large in size, which helps distinguish it from the many similar appearing species that have a smaller stature. A deep blue/indigo bruising of the pore surface and a less dramatic bruising coloration change in the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] over a period of several minutes are identifying characteristics that distinguish it from the similar [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] species ''[[Boletus sensibilis]]''. There are two variations of this species, variety ''borealis'' and variety ''subreticulatus'', and several other similar species of fungi are not poisonous.\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\n''Baorangia bicolor'' was originally named in 1807 by the Italian botanist [[Giuseppe Raddi]].<ref name=Raddi1807>{{Harv|Raddi|1807|pages=62\u2013345}}</ref> American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] named a species collected in Sandlake, [[New York (U.S. state)|New York]], in 1870, ''Boletus bicolor''.

The most common coloration is brick red when mature. The cap usually ranges from {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width, with bright yellow pores underneath. The two-colored bolete is one of several types of boletes that have the unusual reaction of the [[hymenium|pore surface]] producing a dark blue/indigo when it is injured, although the reaction is slower than with other bluing boletes. When the [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is exposed it also turns a dark blue, but less dramatically than the pore surface.<ref name=\"Wernert 1982 p\">{{Harv |Wernert|1982| p=}}</ref> Young [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have bright yellow pore surfacesthat slowly turn a dingy yellow in maturity.\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] of the two-colored bolete ranges from {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and ranges from {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in width. The stem coloration is yellow at the apex and a red or rosy red for the lower two thirds. When injured it bruises blue very slowly and may hardly change color at all in some cases. The stem lacks a [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] and lacks a [[partial veil]].<ref name=\"Bessette\">{{Harv|Bessette|2000|page=97}}</ref>\n\n=== Microscopic characteristics ===\nThe [[spore deposit]] of the two-colored bolete is olive-brown. Viewed with a [[light microscopy|microscope]], the [[spore]]s are slightly oblong to [[ventricose]] in face view; in profile view, the spores are roughly inequilateral to oblong, and have a shallow [[hilum (biology)|suprahilar depression]]. The spores appear nearly [[hyaline]] (translucent) to pale dingy [[ochraceous]] when mounted in [[potassium hydroxide]] solution (KOH), have a smooth surface, and measure 8\u201312 by 3.5\u20135&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The tube [[trama (mycology)|trama]] is [[wikt:divergent gill trama|divergent]] and gelatinous, originates from a single central strand, not [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and will often stain yellow-brown when placed in dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH).<ref name=\"Hanchett\">{{Harv|Bessette|1971|page=275}}</ref>\n\n=== Chemical tests ===\nFurther methods of identification are [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical tests]]. With the application of [[FeSO4|FeSO<sub>4</sub>]] to the cap cuticle ([[pileipellis]]), it will turn a dark grey, almost black color and with the application of potassium hydroxide or [[NH4OH|NH<sub>4</sub>OH]] it has a negative coloration. The [[context (mycology)|context]] stains a bluish grey to an olive green when FeSO<sub>4</sub> is applied to it, a pale orange to a pale yellow with the application of KOH, and negative with the application of NH<sub>4</sub>OH.<ref name=\"Bessette\"/>\n\n== Edibility ==\nThe two-colored bolete is an [[edible mushroom]], although some may have an allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset.<ref name=Roger>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5608.asp |last=Phillips |first=Roger |publisher=RogersMushrooms |title=Boletus bicolor |accessdate=October 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106110228/http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5608.asp |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}</ref> The mushroom has a very mild to no taste<ref name=\"New Jersey Mycological\">{{Cite web|title=Boletus bicolor|publisher=New Jersey Mycological Association|url=http://www.njmyco.org/mushpages/Boletus_bicolor.html|accessdate=October 20, 2011}}</ref> although it is said to have a very distinctive taste like that of the [[king bolete]]. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat.<ref name=mushroomreport>{{cite web|url=http://www.silysavg.com/naturespickings/mushroomreport/two_colored_bolete.html|last=Report|first=Mushroom|publisher=Mushroom Report|title=Boletus bicolor|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref> Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the time it takes for the two-colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to the instant bruising of ''Boletus sensibilis'', which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.<ref name=\"Roger\"/>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe two-colored bolete is distributed from southeastern Canada and the [[Great Lakes Region]], primarily east of the Rocky Mountains, as far south as the Florida peninsula, and out to the  [[Midwest]] as far as [[Wisconsin]]. It is commonly found in [[Deciduous|deciduous woodland]] and usually grows under or close to [[broad-leaved tree]]s, especially [[oak]].<ref name=\"Wernert 1982 p\"/> It can be found in isolation and in groups or clusters, primarily during June through October.<ref name=\"Bessette2\">{{Harv|Bessette|2000|page=98}}</ref> The two-colored bolete is also found in China and Nepal, where it is one of the most used mushrooms of over 200 species of edible mushrooms used in Nepal.<ref name=\"Christensen\">{{Harv|Christensen|2008}}</ref> This unusual distribution of the two-colored bolete and other mushrooms is known as the [[Grayan disjunction]]; the phenomenon is characterized by a species living in one continent or island and then also on the other side of the world with no specimens of the species living in between the specific habitats.

''B.&nbsp;bicoloroide'' is also slightly larger than the two-colored bolete, around {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer in the stem and {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the cap. This species has not been as thoroughly researched as the two-colored bolete, thus macrochemical tests, edibility, distribution range, and the spore print color are all unknown.<ref name=\"Bessette3\">{{Harv|Bessette|2000|page=99}}</ref>\n\n== Varieties ==\nThere are two [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of the two-colored bolete: ''borealis'' and ''subreticulatus''.<ref name=\"Hanchett2\">{{Harv|Bessette|1971|page=278}}</ref> Both varieties have a very similar habitat to that of the main species, except they appear to be limited to just the North American continent. Both varieties also have a slightly different coloration than that of the two-colored bolete, have deeper pores, and are not as often eaten or used in regional recipes.<ref name=\"Hanchett\"/>\n\n=== Variety ''borealis'' ===\nVariety ''borealis'' has a slightly darker color scheme than the main species. The coloration in general is darker; the cap can vary from a bright apple red to a dark brick red with maturity, to almost purple in some instances. The pore surface has a varying coloration of orange red to red and becoming a dull brown red with age. The bruising coloration is a blue green and the spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety ''borealis'' is relatively small, ranging from [[Michigan]] to the upper [[New England]] states. The similar distribution and coloration to ''[[Boletus carminiporus]]'' has caused the two to be confused.<ref name=\"Hanchett\"/> New molecular evidence shows that ''borealis'' is not closely related to ''Baorangia bicolor'' var. ''bicolor''.<ref name=\"Nuhn 2013\"/>\n\n=== Variety ''subreticulatus'' ===\nVariety ''subreticulatus'', like variety ''boralis'', has a generally darker coloration than the two-colored bolete, but varies much more than either. When fresh the coloration of the cap varies from a rose red, red, rose pink, dark red, and purple red. With age it changes to a cinnamon red or a rusty rose color, with yellowing toward the margin. The pore surface is similar to that of the main species&ndash;yellow when fresh and with age changing to a dull ochre yellow; the bruising coloration is blue but is much lighter and sometimes not appearing to stain when bruised at all. The spore print is olive brown.<ref name=\"Hanchett\"/> The distribution of variety ''subreticulatus'' is very similar to the distribution of the two-colored bolete in North America, and appears north to eastern Canada and south to Florida, and west to Wisconsin.<ref name=\"Hanchett\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Boletus bicolor}}\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of North American boletes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Nuhn 2013\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nuhn ME, Binder M, Taylor AF, Halling RE, Hibbett DS |title=Phylogenetic overview of the Boletineae |journal=Fungal Biology |year=2013 |volume=117 |issue=7\u20138 |pages=479\u2013511 |doi=10.1016/j.funbio.2013.04.008 |pmid=23931115}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlFungorum: Boletus bicolor\">{{cite web |title=''Boletus bicolor'' Peck |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=210894 |publisher=[[Index Fungorum]].

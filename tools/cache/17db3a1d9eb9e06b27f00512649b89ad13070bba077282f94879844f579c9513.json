It is found only in New Zealand, where it occurs in ''[[Leptospermum]]'' and ''[[Nothofagus]]'' forest. The species was first described by New Zealand mycologist [[Greta Stevenson]] in 1962; in the same publication Stevenson also described what she thought was a unique species, ''Limacella macrospora'', but over 30 years later this was reduced to [[synonym (biology)|synonymy]] with ''A.&nbsp;australis''.\n\n''Amanita australis'' produces small- to medium-sized [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], with brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter covered with pyramidal warts. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are white, closely crowded together, and free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The stem, which is up to {{convert|9|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|26|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, has a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and a bulbous base. The mushroom may be confused with another [[endemism|endemic]] New Zealand species, ''[[Amanita nothofagi|A.&nbsp;nothofagi]]'', but can be distinguished by differences in microscopic characteristics.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\n''Amanita australis'' was first [[species description|described]] by [[Greta Stevenson]] in 1962, based on specimens she collected in April 1954 around [[Lake Rotoiti, Tasman|Lake Rotoiti]] in [[Nelson Lakes National Park]], in New Zealand. In the same publication, Stevenson described ''Limacella macrospora'', collected in 1952 at [[Eastbourne, New Zealand#Days Bay|Day's Bay]] near [[Wellington]]. Stevenson thought this was a new species different from any previously described ''[[Limacella]]'' because of its larger size and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] spores.<ref name=Stevenson1962/> Austrian mycologist [[Egon Horak]] later transferred it to the genus ''[[Oudemansiella]]'', but did not provide a reason for making the new combination.<ref name=Horak1971/> In 1986, Pegler and Young proposed a classification for ''Oudemansiella'' based largely on [[spore]] structure, but they excluded ''O.&nbsp;macrospora'', considering it a species of ''[[Amanita]]''.<ref name=Pegler1986/> [[Geoff Ridley]] examined Stevenson's [[holotype]] material and reduced ''L.&nbsp;macrosporus'' to [[synonym (biology)|synonymy]] with ''A.&nbsp;australis'' in 1993, explaining: <blockquote>The size, shape and amyloid reaction of the spores, the dimensions of the basidia, the presence of clamp connections and lamella margin cells indicate that this is ''Amanita australis'' Stevenson and easily fits into the concept of this taxon. ... Macroscopically the specimen lacks the typical pronounced basal bulb to the stipe and volva remnants on the pileus; however, it is not an unknown condition in this taxon.<ref name=Ridley1993/></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Stevenson originally placed the species in ''Amanita'' [[section (biology)|section]] ''Phalloideae'' because of a perceived similarity to ''[[Amanita citrina|A.&nbsp;citrina]]'', it is now [[classification (biology)|classified]] in section ''Validae''; many species in this section have bulbous stem bases.<ref name=\"urlAmanita Sect. Validae - species list\"/> Ridley suggests an appropriate [[common name]] would be the \"straw flycap\",<ref name=Ridley2004/> while Rodham Tulloss calls it the \"far south Amanita\".<ref name=\"urlAmanita australis G. Stev.\"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''australis'' means \"southern\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20australis |title=''Amanita australis'' G.

The cap margin sometimes splits and rolls back to give a ragged appearance. The centre of the cap is dark [[buff (color)|buff]], honey or [[isabelline (colour)|isabelline]], becoming paler to buff at the margin. The surface is sticky when young or wet, but dries out with age. The remnants of the [[volva (mycology)|volva]] form conical to pyramidal warts that are most densely aggregated in the center, but become sparse and low towards the margin. They are initially white then greyish-[[sepia (color)|sepia]] or isabelline with white to buff tips.<ref name=Ridley1991/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded closely together, free from attachment to the stem, {{convert|6|\u2013|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide, and white. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem) have truncated ends. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|37|\u2013|90|mm|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|6|\u2013|26|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and narrowest at center. It is hollow, and has an abruptly bulbous base that is between {{convert|14|and|38|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. The surface of the stem above the level of the [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] is white and covered in woolly tufts of mycelia; below the ring it is white with buff to greyish transverse, grooved bands. The base may or may not have a rim of volval remnants that are powdery, and a greyish-buff to greyish-sepia colour. The [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] is membranous, white to buff, first hanging freely then later adhering to the stem. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the cap is white, occasionally pale isabelline under the center of the cap; the flesh of the stem is white.<ref name=Ridley1991/>\n\nThe [[spore print]] is white. The [[spore]]s are  typically 9\u201312 by 8\u201310.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]], spherical to [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and thin-walled. They are [[hyaline]] (translucent), and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]\u2014meaning they will [[staining|stain]] bluish-black to black in [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] are 43.5\u201376.5 by 10.5\u201317&nbsp;\u00b5m, mostly four-spored, and clamped at their bases. There are abundant spherical, elliptic or club-shaped hyaline cells on the gill edges, measuring 16\u201339.5 by 10.5\u201327.5&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is 220\u2013270&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, consisting of a [[gelatin]]ised suprapellis (upper layer) and non-gelatinised subpellis (lower layer). The volval remnants on the cap consist of abundant spherical, club-shaped, or [[wikt:napiform|turnip-shaped]] cells, measuring 10\u201386 by 9\u201385&nbsp;\u00b5m. These cells are [[umber]] in colour, and arranged in chains perpendicular to the cap surface, becoming smaller and paler at tip of the wart, subtended by moderately abundant hyphae that are 4\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. [[Clamp connection]]s are abundant in the hyphae.<ref name=Ridley1991/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Amanita nothofagi 34865.jpg|150px|thumb|right|<center>''A. nothofagi''</center>]]\n''Amanita australis'' mushrooms that have lost their warts and have had the colours faded may resemble another New Zealand species, ''[[Amanita nothofagi|A.&nbsp;nothofagi]]''. The two species may be distinguished reliably using microscopy\u2014''A.&nbsp;nothofagi'' does not have clamp connections at the base of the basidia, unlike ''A.&nbsp;australis''.<ref name=Ridley1991/>''A.&nbsp;australis'' also bears some resemblance to the eastern North American and east Asian species ''[[Amanita abrupta|A.&nbsp;abrupta]]'',<ref name=\"urlAmanita australis G. Stev.\"/> which also has an abruptly bulbous stem base.<ref name=\"urlAmanita abrupta (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Amanita australis'' is found only on the north and south islands of New Zealand, where it grows in a [[mycorrhiza]]l association with  [[Southern Beech]] (genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'') (including [[Nothofagus fusca|New Zealand Red Beech]], [[Silver beech]], [[Nothofagus solandri|New Zealand Black Beech]], [[Hard Beech]]),<ref name=Ridley1991/> ''[[Leptospermum scoparium|Manuka]]'', and ''[[Kunzea ericoides|K\u0101nuka]]''. The mushroom usually grows solitarily, but has on rare occasions been found growing in groups.<ref name=Ridley1991/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Horak1971>{{cite journal |title=A contribution towards the revision of the Agaricales (Fungi) from New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Botany |author=Horak E. |year=1971 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=403\u201363 |doi=10.1080/0028825x.1971.10430193}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Pegler1986>{{cite journal |title=Classification of ''Oudemansiella'' (Basidiomycota, Tricholomataceae), with special reference to spore structure |journal=Transactions of the British Mycological Society |year=1986 |author=Pegler DN, Young TWK. |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=583\u2013602 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59351/0087/004/0583.htm |doi=10.1016/s0007-1536(86)80099-7 |access-date=2011-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923230950/http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59351/0087/004/0583.htm |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ridley1991>{{cite journal|title=The New Zealand species of ''Amanita'' (Fungi: Agaricales) |journal=Australian Systematic Botany |year=1991 |author=Ridley GS. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=325\u201354 |doi=10.1071/SB9910325}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ridley1993>{{cite journal |title=''Limacella macrospora'' Stevenson and ''L. wheroparaonea'', a new species, from New Zealand (Fungi, Agaricales, Amanitaceae) |journal=Australian Systematic Botany |year=1993 |author=Ridley GS. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=155\u201359 |doi=10.1071/SB9930155}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ridley2004>{{cite journal|title=A system for the development of English language names for agarics and boletes in New Zealand |journal=Australasian Mycologist |author=Ridley G. |year=2004 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=27\u201330 |url=http://australasianmycology.com/pages/pdf/23/1/27.pdf }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Stevenson1962>{{cite journal |author=Stevenson G. |year=1962 |title=The Agaricales of New Zealand.

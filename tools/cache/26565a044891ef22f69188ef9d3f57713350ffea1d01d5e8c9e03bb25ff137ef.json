The margin is translucent-striate when moist and uplifted in age. It is [[hygrophanous]], glabrous, dark chestnut brown while lighter towards the center. The pileus is olive-greenish at times, fading to a pale yellowish brown or pale yellow. It is viscid when moist from a gelatinous [[Pellicle (biology)|pellicle]], staining slightly greenish-blue when injured or with age.\n*The '''gills''' are [[adnation|adnate]] or [[sinuate]] or [[adnexed]], close to sub-distant and moderately broad, yellowish brown at first, soon violet brown or chocolate brown to blackish violet, and uniform or somewhat mottled, with whitish edges.\n*The '''spores''' are (8.2)9.3 \u2014  10.4(13.5) X 6 \u2014  7.1(7.7) x 5.5 \u2014  6.6 [[\u03bcm]], [[subrhomboid]] in face view, [[subellipsoid]] in side view, with a hilar appendage visible and a truncate apex with a broad germ pore, thick walled, and dingy yellow brown.\n*The '''[[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]]''' is (2)3.5 \u2014  6.5(7.5) cm x (1.5)2 \u2014  4(6) mm, equal or slightly enlarged at the base, cylindric or subcylindric, twisted striate at times, flexuous, [[glabrousness (botany)|glabrous]] to slightly [[fibrillose]], dry, stuffed with a pith and becoming hollow, and white or whitish silky to ochraceous or brownish fibrillose. The partial veil thinly membranous, leaving a fragile annulus that becomes more noticeable as it darkens with spores. It stains blue-green when injured. The [[spore print]] is dark violacous brown.\n*The '''taste''' and '''odor''' of ''Psilocybe stuntzii'' are [[farinaceous]].\n*'''Microscopic features''': The basidia are 16.5 \u2014  33 x 5.5 \u2014  8.8 [[\u03bcm]], 4-spored, and hyaline. [[Pleurocystidia]] are absent and [[cheilocystidia]] are 22 \u2014  30 x 4.4 \u2014  6.6&nbsp;\u03bcm, abundant, forming a sterile band, [[hyaline]], lageniform, fusiform-lanceolate or fusoid-ampullaceous, with an elongate and flexuous neck, and are 1 \u2014  2.2&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter, sometimes irregularly branched. Clamp connections are present.\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[File:Psilocybe.stuntzii.spores.bg.jpg|thumb|right|''Psilocybe stuntzii'' spores seen through a [[microscope]] ]]\n\n''Psilocybe stuntzii'' is found growing scattered to [[gregarious]] to cespitose, rarely solitary, in [[conifer]] wood chips and bark mulch, in soils rich in woody debris, and in new lawns of freshly laid sod or any newly mulched garden throughout the western region of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. From late July through December, \nhas been observed growing all year long in the [[Seattle, Washington]] area, also reported from [[California]], rarely as far south as [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]].\nThere was a time when this mushroom appeared in over 40 percent of all new lawns and mulched in areas in the [[Puget Sound]] region of the Pacific Northwest. Due to a disappearance of pastures south of [[Seattle]] in the Tukwila-Kent-Auburn areas, this mushroom now only appears sporadically in certain new lawns which are well fertilized and manicured.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Edibility==\nThis mushroom is hallucinogenic. Additionally, it closely resembles the highly toxic ''[[Galerina marginata]]'', and several poisonings have been attributed to collectors consuming ''G. marginata'' after mistaking them for hallucinogenic ''P. stuntzii''.<ref name=Stamets1996>{{cite book |author=Stamets P. |title=Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World: An Identification Guide |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1996 |page=195 |isbn=0-89815-839-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3u-DyDXgQiEC&pg=PA195}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Psilocybin mushrooms]]\n*[[List of Psilocybin mushrooms]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Mycologia 68(6): 1261 (1977)\n*{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Stamets | year=1996 | title=Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World | publisher=Ten Speed Press | location=Berkeley | isbn=0-9610798-0-0}}\n*Guzm\u00e1n, G.

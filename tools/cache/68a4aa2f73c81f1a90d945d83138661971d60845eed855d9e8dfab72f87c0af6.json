''Psilocybe hispanica'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Semilanceata'' of the genus ''[[Psilocybe]]'' because of its thick-walled [[spore]]s and [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] that bruises blue with handling.<ref name=Guzman2000/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''hispanica'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"Spanish\".<ref name=Cady2005/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] ranges in shape from somewhat conical to convex, and reaches diameters of {{convert|5|to|10|mm|in|1}}. Its surface is smooth, somewhat sticky to dry, and brown to brownish-yellow. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are somewhat [[adnation|adnate]], and brown-violaceous with whitish edges. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|16|to|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|to|1|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, and slightly bulbous at the base. It is whitish-yellow, with [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] or blue-green to blackish tones towards the base. Mature specimens do not have a [[annulus (mycology)|veil]] on the stem. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, but like most psilocybin-containing species, stains blue when injured.<ref name=Guzman2000/>\n\nThe [[spore]]s are [[ellipsoid]] and measure 12\u201314.5 by 6.5\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. They have a brownish-yellow wall greater than 1&nbsp;\u03bcm thick and a broad apical [[germ pore]] with an acute [[hilum (biology)|hilar appendix]] at the base (a region where the spore was once attached to the [[sterigma]]). The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are four-spored, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and measure 32\u201344 by 8\u201312&nbsp;\u03bcm. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of a layer 130\u2013150&nbsp;\u03bcm thick, with hyaline, thin-walled gelatinized [[hypha]]e measuring 1.5\u20134&nbsp;\u03bcm broad. The hypodermium (the tissue layer directly under the pileipellis) is made of thin-walled, hyaline hyphae, 2.5\u20138&nbsp;\u03bcm broad, with a brownish incrusting [[pigment]]. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae.<ref name=Guzman2000/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Psilocybe coprophila 98976.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (130 * 1465 / 1089) round 0}}\n| caption1 = ''Deconica coprophila''\n| image2 = Psilocybe semilanceata 6514.jpg\n| width2 = 130\n| caption2 = ''Psilocybe semilanceata''\n}}\n''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' is roughly similar in appearance to ''P.&nbsp;hispanica'', but may distinguished by its mycenoid (''[[Mycena]]''-like) appearance and acute [[umbo (mycology)|umbonate]] cap.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Although the grassland habitat of the two species is similar, ''P.&nbsp;semilanceata'' does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a [[saprobic]] species that grows on decaying grass roots.<ref name=Keay1990/> ''[[Psilocybe fimetaria|P.&nbsp;fimetaria]]'' also resembles ''P.&nbsp;hispanica'', but it also has a mycenoid appearance and has a ring on the stem.

''P.&nbsp;hispanica'' differs from ''[[Psilocybe liniformans|P.&nbsp;liniformans]]'' var. ''liniformans'' in that it lacks a gelatinous gill edge. [[Psilocybe liniformans var. americana|''P. liniformans'' var. ''americana'']] has larger cheilocystidia, measuring 22\u201333 by 5.5\u20139&nbsp;\u03bcm, and it is known to grow only on soil around herbs, in the Northwest and Northeast USA and Chile.<ref name=Guzman2000/> ''[[Deconica coprophila]]'' (formerly known as ''Psilocybe coprophila'') is a [[little brown mushroom|small brownish mushroom]] that also grows on dung, but it does not contain psilocybin and does not have a bluing stem.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Psilocybe coprophila\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Psilocybe hispanica'' is a [[coprophilous fungus]] (dung-loving), and produces fruit bodies that grow solitarily or in dense groups on horse dung; sometimes more than 25 fruit bodies can arise from the same dung.<ref name=Guzman2003/> In Guzm\u00e1n's original report, they were found in a Pyrenean meadow in [[Aragon]], at an elevation of {{convert|2300|m}}. In 2003, the species was reported from Tramacastillo de Tena, a small village in the Pyrenees; it was also reported to have \"penetrated the French part of the Pyrenees\".

The mushrooms\u2014possibly either ''P.&nbsp;semilanceata'' or ''P.&nbsp;hispanica'', according to Guzm\u00e1n and Castro\u2014were used in [[witchcraft]], a common practice in the valley during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=Guzman2003/>\n\nIt has been argued that prehistoric rock art at a site known as Selva Pascuala near the Spanish town of [[Villar del Humo]] offers evidence that ''P.&nbsp;hispanica'' was used in [[religious ritual]]s 6,000 years ago. The [[rock shelter]] at Selva Pascuala was discovered in the early 20th century; in the early 21st century it was noticed that objects in one of the murals, which  previously had been described as \"mushrooms\", matched the general [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of ''P.&nbsp;hispanica'': the mural depicts a row of 13 mushroom-like objects with convex to conical caps, and ringless stems that vary from straight to sinuous (wavy). Additionally, the mural shows a bull, which suggests an association with the coprophilic ''P.&nbsp;hispanica''. Although the hallucinogenic species ''P.&nbsp;semilanceata'' is also widespread in the area where the mural was found, its differing shape (narrowly conical and acutely [[papilla (mycology)|papillate]]) and its habitat on soil instead of dung suggests it is not the species represented in the mural. If the interpretation is correct, the mural represents the oldest evidence of psychedelic fungi use in Europe, and the third reported instance of rock art suggesting prehistoric usage of neurotropic fungi. The only older example is from [[Tassili n'Ajjer]], in the [[Sahara desert]] in southeast [[Algeria]]. In 1992, the Italian ethnobotanist [[Giorgio Samorini]] reported finding a painted mural dated 7000 to 9000 BCE portraying mushrooms,<ref name=Samorini1992/> later tentatively identified as ''[[Psilocybe mairei]]'', a species known from Algeria and [[Morocco]].<ref name=Akers2011/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of psilocybin mushrooms]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Akers2011>{{cite journal |vauthors=Akers BP, Ruiz JF, Piper A, Ruck CA |title=A prehistoric mural in Spain depicting neurotropic ''Psilocybe'' mushrooms? |journal=Economic Botany |year=2011 |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=121\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s12231-011-9152-5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Cady2005>{{cite book |author=Cady M. |title=Plant Names Explained: Botanical Terms and Their Meaning |publisher=Horticulture Books |location=Boston, Massachusetts |year=2005 |page=100 |isbn=1-55870-747-6}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Cole2006>{{cite book|author=Cole SM. |title=New Research on Street Drugs |year=2006 |publisher=Nova Publishers |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-59454-961-8 |page=169 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovGcMmz5emUC&pg=PA169}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=FernandezSasia2006>{{cite journal |title=''Psilocybe hispanica'' Guzm\u00e1n, un tax\u00f3n novedoso en nuestro entorno |trans-title=''Psilocybe hispanica'' Guzm\u00e1n, a new taxon in our environment |journal=Errotari |year=2006 |author=Fern\u00e1ndez-Sasia R. |volume=3 |pages=73\u20136 |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Guzman2000>{{cite journal |author=Guzm\u00e1n G. |title=New species and new records of ''Psilocybe'' from Spain, the U.S.A. and Mexico, and a new case of poisoning by ''Psilocybe barrerae'' |journal=Documents Mycologiques |year=2000 |volume=29 |issue=116 |pages=41\u201352}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Guzman2003>{{cite journal |vauthors=Guzm\u00e1n G, Castro ML |title=Observaciones sobre algunas especies conocidas de ''Psilocybe'' (Basidiomycotina, Agaricales, Strophariaceae) de Espa\u00f1a y descripci\u00f3n de una nueva especie |trans-title=Observations on some known species of ''Psilocybe'' (Basidiomycotina, Agaricales, Strophariaceae) from Spain and description of a new species |journal=Bolet\u00edn Sociedad Micol\u00f3gica de Madrid |year=2003 |volume=27 |pages=181\u20137 |language=Spanish, English |url=http://www.samorini.it/doc1/alt_aut/ek/guzman03.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Keay1990>{{cite journal |vauthors=Keay SM, Brown AE |title=Colonization by ''Psilocybe semilanceata'' of roots of grassland flora |journal=Mycological Research |year=1990 |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=49\u201356 |doi=10.1016/S0953-7562(09)81263-X}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Samorini1992>{{cite journal |author=Samorini G. |title=The oldest representations of hallucinogenic mushrooms in the world (Sahara Desert, 9000\u20137000 B.P.) |journal=Integration |year=1992 |volume=2|issue=3 |pages=69\u201378 |url=http://www.artepreistorica.com/2009/12/the-oldest-representations-of-hallucinogenic-mushrooms-in-the-world-sahara-desert-9000-%E2%80%93-7000-b-p/}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Psilocybe coprophila\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Psilocybe_coprophila.html |title=''Psilocybe coprophila'' |vauthors=Wood M, Stevens F |work=California Fungi |publisher=MykoWeb |accessdate=2011-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102014556/http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Psilocybe_coprophila.html |archivedate=2011-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IndexFungorum|11426}}\n*[http://www.mushroomjohn.org/psilocybehispanica2.htm Images]\n\n{{hallucinogenic mushrooms}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q7255885}}\n\n[[Category:Entheogens]]\n[[Category:Psychoactive fungi]]\n[[Category:Psilocybe|hispanica]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic tryptamine carriers]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 2000]]"}]}}}}

At a time when most [[Agaric|gilled mushrooms]] were lumped into genus ''[[Agaricus]]'', Paulet invented genus ''Dendrosarcos'', later Latinised to ''Dendrosarcus'', for those having an excentric or missing stipe.  In fact those fungi have not been found to be a closely related group, and today the name only has historical interest, though the taxonomic rules imply that it still needs to be recorded.<ref name=SF1/><ref name=SF2/><ref name=Paulet/>  In 1871 in his \"F\u00fchrer in die Pilzkunde\" (\"Guide to Mycology\"), [[Paul Kummer]] introduced ''Pleurotus'' as a genus,<ref name=Kummer/> but the allocation of ''P. cornucopiae'' to it was only done later in 1910 by [[L\u00e9on Louis Rolland]].<ref name=SF2/>\n\nThe synonym ''Pleurotus sapidus'' due to Schulzer (1873) is sometimes seen\n\nThe English name \"Branched Oyster Mushroom\" has been given to this species.<ref name=FirstNature/>\n\n==Description==\nThe following sections use the given references throughout.<ref name=Bon/><ref name=Courtecuisse/><ref name=FN/><ref name=Moser/>\n\n===General===\n*The cap grows to about 15&nbsp;cm, with a pale yellowish, brownish or greyish surface.  At most there may be very slight traces of the veil.\n*The stem is always present, may be forked and can vary from excentric to fairly central.  Each stem may be up to about 11&nbsp;cm long and up to 2&nbsp;cm thick.\n*The whitish [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[decurrent]] down the stem and [[Anastomosis|anastomose]] (criss-cross), becoming a network of ridges at the bottom.  \n*The strong smell has an [[aniseed]] element and is also floury when the mushroom is cut.  The taste is floury.<ref name=Eyssartier/><ref name=Moser/><ref name=FN/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n*The flesh may be [[Hypha#Classification based on cell wall and overall form|monomitic]] (as with ordinary fragile mushrooms) or [[Hypha#Classification based on cell wall and overall form|dimitic]], having extra thick-walled hyphae which give the flesh a tougher consistency, especially when older.<ref name=FN/>\n*The spores in the form of an rather elongated ellipsoid are around 8-11&nbsp;\u00b5m by 3.5-5.5&nbsp;\u00b5m.\n*There are no [[Cystidium|cystidia]].\n\n===Distribution, habitat & ecology===\nThis mushroom is [[saprobic]] on dead wood and can also be a weak [[parasite]].<ref name=FN/>  It occurs stumps and fallen trunks of oak, beech, elm, and other broad-leaved trees.\n\nAppearing from spring to late summer, it is distributed in the wild throughout Europe, where it varies locally between common and fairly rare.<ref name=Courtecuisse/>  It is also reported from the U.S. and Mexico.<ref name=GBIF/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Limonenseitlinge (Pleurotus citrinopileatus) - ver2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''P. citrinopileatus'' in a German market]]\n''P. cornucopiae'' is quite similar to the well-known food mushroom ''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]'', being distinguished because in the latter case, the gills are not very [[decurrent]] and the cap colour is slate or bluish grey.  Another species, ''[[Pleurotus pulmonarius]]'' has a comparable cap colour to ''P. cornucopiae'' but the gills on the stipe are similar to ''P. ostreatus''.\n\nIt is even more closely related to the yellow-capped \"golden oyster mushroom\", ''[[Pleurotus citrinopileatus]]'', which is native to eastern Asia.  The forms are easily distinguishable by the cap colour, but they are sometimes considered to be just varieties of the same species, and as a consequence golden oyster mushrooms are sometimes identified using the older scientific name ''Pleurotus cornucopiae''.<ref name=Royse/>  However, according to the mycological reference \"Species Fungorum\", these are two separate species.<ref name=SF3/>\n\n==Human impact==\nThis mushroom is edible and it is cultivated in a manner similar to [[Pleurotus ostreatus|P. ostreatus]], though less extensively.<ref name=Mushroomers/>  For instance a Chinese paper evaluated several commercially available varieties of ''P. cornucopiae'' and reported that it in the Shanghai area an appropriate growth medium is cotton-seed hulls and wood-chips, with 65% water content.<ref name=Shi/>  Another paper (actually treating the yellow-topped form) also suggested pasteurized switch grass as a useful substrate, though the yield was less than with cotton-seed hulls and straw.<ref name=Royse/>\n\nIt is a mild parasite of broad-leaved trees.<ref name=FN/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Bon>{{cite book |author =Marcel Bon |title=The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North-Western Europe |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |year=1987 |page=120 |isbn=978-0-340-39935-4 |author-link=Marcel Bon }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Courtecuisse>{{cite book |author1=Courtecuisse, R.  |author2=Duhem, B. |title=Champignons de France et d'Europe |language=French |publisher=Delachaux et Niestl\u00e9 |year=2013 |page=190 |isbn=978-2-603-02038-8 }}  Also available in English.</ref>\n\n<ref name=Eyssartier>{{cite book |author1=Eyssartier, G.  |author2=Roux, P. |title=Le guide des champignons France et Europe |language=French |publisher=Belin |year=2013 |page=974 |isbn=978-2-7011-8289-6 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=FirstNature>{{cite web |url=http://www.first-nature.com/fungi/pleurotus-cornucopiae.php |title=Pleurotus cornucopiae (Paulet) Rolland - Branched Oyster Mushroom |accessdate=2017-02-10 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=FN>{{cite book |editor-first1=H. |editor-last1=Knudsen |editor-first2=J. |editor-last2=Vesterholt |title=Funga Nordica Agaricoid, boletoid and cyphelloid genera |publisher=Nordsvamp |location=Copenhagen |year=2008 |page=322 |isbn=978-87-983961-3-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=GBIF>See the [https://www.gbif.org/species/2526649 Global Biodiversity Information Facility page], which provides hyperlinks to records with geographical location.</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kummer>{{cite book |author =Paul Kummer |title=Der F\u00fchrer in die Pilzkunde.

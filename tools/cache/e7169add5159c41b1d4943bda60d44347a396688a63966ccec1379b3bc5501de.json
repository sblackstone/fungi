It produces [[mushroom]]s with pinkish-cinnamon [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide held by pinkish-white [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The closely spaced whitish to pinkish [[buff (color)|buff]] [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] develop wine-red spots in age. When it is cut or injured, the mushroom oozes a white [[latex]] that rapidly turns bright sulfur-yellow. The species, common and widely distributed in North America, grows in the ground in association with [[conifer]] trees. There are several other ''Lactarius'' species that bear resemblance to ''L.&nbsp;vinaceorufescens'', but most can be distinguished by differences in [[staining]] reactions, macroscopic characteristics, or habitat.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\nThe species was first  [[species description|described]] by American mycologists [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler]] and  [[Alexander H. Smith]] in 1960, based on specimens collected in [[Muskegon, Michigan]] in 1936. In the same publication, they also named the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''Lactarius vinaceorufescens''&nbsp;var.&nbsp;''fallax'' to account for individuals with prominently projecting [[wikt:pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] measuring 9\u201312&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] broad,<ref name=Hesler1960/> but they reduced this to [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] with the main species in their 1979 [[monograph]] of North American ''[[Lactarius]]'' species.<ref name=\"H&S pp. 317-19\">Hesler and Smith (1979), pp. 317\u201319.</ref> The fungus is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the subsection ''Croceini'' of the [[subgenus]] ''Piperates'' in the genus ''Lactarius'', along with other species with [[latex]] that stains the [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] tissue yellow, or with latex that slowly become yellow upon exposure to air.<ref>Hesler and Smith (1979), pp. 304\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''vinaceorufescens'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word meaning \"becoming wine reddish\".<ref name=Roody2003/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"yellow-latex milky\"<ref name=Bessette2009/> or the \"yellow-staining milkcap\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lactarius vinaceorufescens 58726.jpg|thumb|180px|left|The latex rapidly turns yellow upon exposure to air.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''L.&nbsp;vinaceorufescens'' is initially convex, then becomes broadly convex to nearly flat, and reaches diameters of {{convert|4|\u2013|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The cap margin is rolled inwards at first, but later expands, becoming somewhat uplifted and uneven with age. The cap surface is smooth, pale pinkish cinnamon with pinkish [[buff (color)|buff]] at the margin when young, becoming darker pinkish cinnamon to orangey cinnamon when older, faintly zoned with bands or water spots of nearly the same color. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are attached to slightly decurrent, narrow, close together, and often forked near the stem. There are several tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not fully extend to the stem from the cap margin). The gills are initially whitish to pinkish buff, later spotting [[wine (color)|wine red]] (vinaceous) to pinkish brown or dark reddish brown. The [[latex]] that is exuded when the mushroom is cut or injured is initially white, but rapidly turns sulfur-yellow.<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4|\u2013|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, nearly equal in width throughout or enlarged slightly downward, and hollow. The stem surface is nearly smooth, with white to brownish stiff hairs at the base, pinkish-white overall, and darkening with age. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is moderately thick, white to pinkish, staining bright sulfur yellow. It has an [[wikt:acrid|acrid]] taste. The [[spore print]] is white to yellowish.<ref name=Bessette2009/> The mushrooms are [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]]; as a general rule, several guide books recommend to avoid the consumption of ''Lactarius'' species with latex that turns yellow.<ref name=Arora1986/><ref name=Ammirati1985/>\n\nThe [[spore]]s are roughly spherical to broadly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], [[hyaline]] (translucent), [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and measure 6.5\u20139 by 6\u20137&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are ornamented with warts and ridges that sometimes form a partial [[wikt:reticulum|reticulum]], with prominences up to 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[basidium|basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, and measure 28\u201333 by 8\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m. The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] found on the gill faces) are roughly cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped when they are young, but soon broaden in the mid portion and taper to an abrupt point; they reach dimensions of 40\u201368 (up to 80&nbsp;\u00b5m) by 9\u201313&nbsp;\u00b5m. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges) are roughly club-shaped or [[wikt:ventricose|ventricose]] with acute apices, and measure 32\u201344 by 6\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent in the [[hypha]]e. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a thin [[wikt:ixocutis|ixocutis]] composed of gelatinous [[hypha]]e that are typically 2\u20134&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. Projecting out from the cuticle surface are the ends of numerous connective hyphae, about 5\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m long.<ref name=\"H&S pp. 317-19\"/>\n\n==Similar species==\n[[File:Lactarius chrysorrheus 041120w.jpg|thumb|160px|right|''Lactarius chrysorrheus'' also produces yellow latex.]]\n''[[Lactarius xanthogalactus]]'' has nearly identical microscopic features to ''L.&nbsp;vinaceorufescens'', but macroscopically, it does not have the reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem of ''L.&nbsp;vinaceorufescens'', and it grows on the ground under [[oak]]. Another lookalike is ''[[Lactarius colorascens|L.&nbsp;colorascens]]'', but it may be distinguished from ''L.&nbsp;vinaceorufescens'' by several features: a smaller fruit body; a whitish cap that becomes brownish red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown; bitter to faintly acrid latex; and slightly smaller spores. ''[[Lactarius chrysorrheus|L.&nbsp;chrysorrheus]]'' is also similar, but it has a whitish to pale yellowish-cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown.<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\nOther superficially similar species include ''[[Lactarius rubrilacteus|L.&nbsp;rubrilacteus]]'', ''[[Lactarius rufus|L.&nbsp;rufus]]'', ''[[Lactarius subviscidus|L.&nbsp;subviscidus]]'', ''[[Lactarius fragilis|L.&nbsp;fragilis]]'' and ''[[Lactarius rufulus|L.&nbsp;rufulus]]'', but none of these species have the yellow staining reaction characteristic of ''L.&nbsp;vinaceorufescens''.<ref name=Arora1986/> The [[edible mushroom|edible]] species ''[[Lactarius helvus]]'' has an orange-brown to light grayish-brown cap with thin bands of dark grayish-brown, a watery latex, and whitish to tan flesh with an odor resembling maple sugar or burnt sugar.<ref name=Bessett2001/> ''[[Lactarius theiogalus]]'', the \"sulfur-milk Lactarius\", has an oranger cap and white latex that slowly changes yellow upon exposure to air; it is typically found in [[deciduous forest|broadleaf]] and [[mixed forest|mixed woods]].<ref name=Roody2003/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[File:Lactarius vinaceorufescens 62303.jpg|thumb|190px|right|The foreground specimen has stiff white hairs at the base of the stem.]]\nThe fruit bodies of ''Lactarius vinaceorufescens'' grow scattered or in groups on the ground under [[pine]] between August and October.

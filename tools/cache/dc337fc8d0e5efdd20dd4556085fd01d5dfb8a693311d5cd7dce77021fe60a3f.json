The [[cap (mycology)|cap]] has a distinctive pattern of color, often dark in the center, then pale, then dark over the inner edges of the [[Lamella (mycology)|lamellae]] and on the ridges between the marginal striations and at other times pallid in the center, but also strongly [[zonate]]; intensity of pigmentation is variable, with the center ranging from umber to grayish umber-brown to beige or pale grayish brown even within a single collection. The [[gill (mycology)|gills]] are free, crowded, off-white to sordid pale cream in mass, and up to 6&nbsp;mm (0.6&nbsp;cm) broad; the short gills are [[truncate]], of varying length, scattered and unevenly distributed.<ref name=Amanitaceae>{{cite web | url = http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20umbrinolutea| title = ''Amanita umbrinolutea''|work=Amanitaceae.org |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>\n\nThe stem is 115 - 185 \u00d7 6 \u2013 11&nbsp;mm, pale cream to pale [[beige]] or isabella color or pale grayish brown, with a faint appressed zigzag girdles of fibrils, with a fleshy [[Membrane (biology)|membranous]] sack-like volva at the base. The 30 \u2013 40&nbsp;mm high volva is attached to the bottom 5&nbsp;mm or so of the stipe. The spores measure 10.5-13.4 \u00d7 9.5-12.5 (1.05-1.34 x 0.95-1.25&nbsp;cm) [[\u03bcm]] and are [[Globose|subglobose]] (infrequently either globose or broadly [[ellipsoid]]) and [[inamyloid]]. Clamps are absent from the bases of [[basidia]]. ''Amanita umbrinolutea'' is widely distributed in [[Europe]]. The specimens different researchers and scientists have examined has all been found in association with [[conifers]] (including [[pine]] and [[spruce]]); and its range extends eastward at least to around northwestern [[Pakistan]] and [[northern India]].<ref name=\"Amanitaceae\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Amanita]]\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of Amanita Species]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{CCBYSASource|sourcepath=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+manginiana|sourcearticle=Amanita manginiana|revision=740502386|authors(s)=Rodham E.

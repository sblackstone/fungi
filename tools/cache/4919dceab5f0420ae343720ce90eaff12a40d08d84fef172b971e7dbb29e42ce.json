Originally described as ''Hygrophorus conicus'', it may be a [[species complex|complex]] of closely related and similar species.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically in 1774 by German polymath [[Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer]], who named it ''Agaricus conicus''.<ref name=\"Schaeffer 1774\"/> [[Paul Kummer]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Hygrocybe]]'' in 1871.<ref name=\"Kummer 1871\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Saftling.jpg|thumb|left|Showing some black discolouration]]\nThe witch's hat is a small mushroom, with a convex to conical yellow-orange to red [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] 2 to 5&nbsp;cm (\u00be-2&nbsp;inches) in diameter, though very occasionally larger specimens up to 8 or 9&nbsp;cm (3\u00bd in) diameter are found. It turns black when cut or bruised.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe witch's hat is widely distributed in grasslands and [[conifer]] woodlands across North America, Europe and [[Asia]], as well as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], being found in summer and autumn. It is likely that what is currently termed ''Hygrocybe conica'' is a complex of closely related species, some of which are suspected of being poisonous.<ref>{{cite book | author = Nilsson S, Persson O| year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin |location= New York, New York | isbn = 978-0-14-063006-0 }}</ref>\nThough ''Hygrocybe conica'' occurs in Australia, principally near urban areas, many collections originally assigned to this species are the similar ''[[Hygrocybe astatogala]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author= Young AM| year =2005 | title = Fungi of Australia: Hygrophoraceae | publisher = (Australian Biological Resources Study) CSIRO |location= Canberra, ACT | isbn = 978-0-643-09195-5}}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nThe edibility or otherwise of ''Hygrocybe conica'' is unclear. Its small size and being coated in a sticky substance render it of limited palatability anyway, however there is a report of poisoning from [[China]] in the early part of the 20th century which was allegedly from this species.<ref>{{cite web| author=Kuo M | url=http://mushroomexpert.com/hygrocybe_conica.html |work= Mushroomexpert |title=Hygrocybe conica|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Hygrocybe species|List of ''Hygrocybe'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Kummer 1871\">{{cite book |author=Kummer P. |title=Der F\u00fchrer in die Pilzkunde |year=1871 |publisher=C.&nbsp;Luppe |location=Zerbst |page=111 |language=German |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/34209641#page/119/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Schaeffer 1774\">{{cite book |author=Schaeffer, Julius C. |title=Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur Icones |year=1774 |volume=4 |location=Regensburg |page=2 |language=Latin |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/3887484|publisher=Apud J.J.

It is variable but easy to recognize because the [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] soon becomes distinctively tough, bloated and ridged.\n\n==Naming==\nThis species was originally described by [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Bulliard]] in his 1793 \"Herbier de la France\" as ''Agaricus fusipes'' at a time when all [[Lamella (mycology)|gilled]] mushrooms were assigned to genus ''Agaricus''.<ref name=Bulliard/>  Then in 1821 [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] published his \"Natural Arrangement of British Plants\" (including fungi) in which he allocated the species to the already existing genus ''Gymnopus''.<ref name=Gray/>\n\nHowever Gray's book was not very popular and in 1872 [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] put this mushroom in genus ''[[Collybia]]'', giving it the name ''Collybia fusipes'' by which it was generally known for many years.  In much later work culminating in 1997, Anton\u00edn and Noordeloos found that the genus ''Collybia'' as defined at that time was unsatisfactory due to being [[polyphyletic]] and they proposed a fundamental rearrangement.  They resurrected the genus ''Gymnopus'' for some species including ''fusipes'', and after subsequent DNA studies, this has been accepted by modern authorities including [[Species Fungorum]] and the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]], and so its current name has reverted to Gray's combination, ''Gymnopus fusipes''.  There was also an alternative move to reclassify it under ''[[Rhodocollybia]]'', but that has not generally been accepted.<ref name=Antonin1997/><ref name=SF1/><ref name=GBIF/>\n\n''G. fusipes'' is the [[type species]] of the genus ''Gymnopus''.\n\nThe species name ''fusipes'' indicates that the stem is spindle-shaped (from the Latin ''fusus'' meaning \"spindle\" and ''pes'' meaning \"foot\").<ref name=fusus/>\n\nThe English name \"Spindle Shank\" has been given to this species.<ref name=Phillips/>  Earlier in 1821 [[Samuel Frederick Gray|Gray]] had already given it the English name \"Spindle naked-foot\", but that suggestion never gained much popularity.<ref name=Gray/>\n\n==Description==\nThis mushroom is very variable, though it is easy to recognize on close examination, at least when not young, due to the distinctive tough stem.  The following sections use the given references throughout.<ref name=Bon/><ref name=Courtecuisse/><ref name=FN/><ref name=Moser/>\n\n===General===\n*The cap, growing from about 3&nbsp;cm to 10&nbsp;cm, is smooth and dark red-brown, or may be paler, sometimes with dark spots.  \n*There is no ring or other veil remnant.  The red-brownish stem is often lighter at the top and can grow to about 15&nbsp;cm long, sometimes rooting.  At least when older the stem typically becomes inflated and deeply furrowed and also develops a distinctive tough consistency.  Sometimes a new clump of these mushrooms grows from the stem bases left from the previous year.<ref name=Bon/>\n*The usually well-spaced gills are whitish and may be flecked with spots.\n\n[[File:Illustrations of British Fungi (Hymenomycetes), to serve as an atlas to the \"Handbook of British Fungi\" (Pl. 141) (6056201280).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Illustration by M. C.Cooke]]\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n*The ellipsoidal spores are around 4.5-6&nbsp;\u03bcm by 3-4.5&nbsp;\u03bcm.\n*[[Clamp connection]]s are present in all parts of the fungus.\n\n===Distribution, habitat & ecology===\nThis mushroom grows in often large clumps at the base of trees, or on roots or stumps.  It is always associated with wood, which may however be buried and not immediately visible.  Its main host is [[oak]], but sometimes it is also found on [[beech]].  This mushroom is [[saprobic]] on dead wood and it is also a serious [[parasite]].\n\nAppearing from summer to autumn, it is distributed throughout Europe, where it varies locally between quite common and quite rare.<ref name=Courtecuisse/><ref name=GBIF/>  Also the fungus is spreading as a disease to North America, particularly on [[Northern Red Oak]].<ref name=firstNature/>\n\n==Human impact==\nMost authors do not consider this species worthwhile for the table,<ref name=firstNature/> but although this mushroom soon becomes tough, the caps (only) are said to be edible and good when young.<ref name=Bon/><ref name=champyves/>   Note that with its resistant texture ''G. fusipes'' can often appear collectable after several months of growth, but due to the normal development of organisms of putrescence during that time, such specimens could cause [[gastro-enteritis]].  Any rancid smell is a sign that the mushrooms are too old.<ref name=champyves/>\n\nIt is a serious parasite of [[oak]] trees, causing a root rot.<ref name=FN/><ref name=firstNature/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Antonin1997>See [[Collybia|the WP Collybia page]] for full details.

A hot water extraction or tea can be very effective for extracting the [[polysaccharide]]s; however, an alcohol or alcohol/glycerin extraction method is more effective for the [[triterpenoid]]s.<ref>Gary Emberger, [[Messiah College]], [http://www.messiah.edu/Oakes/fungi_on_wood/poroid%20fungi/species%20pages/Ganoderma%20tsugae.htm ''Ganoderma tsugae''], 2006.

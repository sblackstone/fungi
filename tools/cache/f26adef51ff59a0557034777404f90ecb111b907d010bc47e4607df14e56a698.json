First collected in 2000, it was [[species description|described]] in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi. The species produces small mushrooms with white [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] and very short, very thin black [[stipe (mycology)|stems]]. Unlike in other, similar species, the stems enter the plant matter on which the mushroom grows. The six to eight white gills are spread out around the cap, and all of them reach the stem. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] has no taste or odour. Found in June, the species grows on dead ''[[Sasa (plant)|Sasa]]'' leaves, from which it takes its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]].\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n''Marasmius sasicola'' was first [[species description|described]] by Haruki Takahashi (2002) in an article in ''[[Mycoscience]]'', based on specimens collected from Ikuta Ryokuchi Park, [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan in 2000 and 2001. The [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''sasicola'' refers to the fact the species grows upon the leaves of ''[[Sasa (plant)|Sasa]]'' species. The Japanese [[common name]] for the species is ''Sasa-no-houraitake''. Within the genus ''[[Mycena]]'', it probably belongs to the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Marasmius'', and the [[subsection (botany)|subsection]] ''Penicillati'', due to characters of the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] and [[pileipellis]] (the outer-most layer of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]).<ref name=\"Takahashi\">{{cite journal |last1= Takahashi|first1= Haruki|year= 2002|title= Four new species of ''Crinipellis'' and ''Marasmius'' in eastern Honshu, Japan|journal= Mycoscience|volume= 43|issue= 4|pages= 343\u2013350|url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/1m7jfg69f5j6awqp/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1007/s102670200050}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n''Marasmius sasicola'' produces mushrooms that have convex caps from {{convert|5|to|10|mm|in|sigfig=1}} in diameter featuring folds or striations. The caps do not expand or flatten with age, and are dry and dull. The cap surface is covered in tiny grains which vanish as the mushrooms age. The caps of young mushrooms are coloured light brown, but paler at the cap margin; as they mature, the caps become paler, approaching white when fully matured. The very thin, smooth [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures between {{convert|2|and|3|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in length by {{convert|0.3|to|0.4|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} thick. It connects to the centre of the cap, and is a dark brown to black colour. [[Mycelial cord]]s cannot be seen at the base of the stem, which anchors itself into the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. The white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] can be adnexed (attaching to the stem by only part of their depth) to adnate (attaching by their full depth). They are not at all crowded, with between 6 and 8 separate gills, all of which reach the stem. Each gill is up to {{convert|2|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} broad, though it is thinner at the edge. The mushrooms have a very thin layer of whitish [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] up to {{convert|0.4|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} thick. The tough but flexible flesh lacks any odour or taste.<ref name=\"Takahashi\"/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n''Marasmius sasicola'' produces colourless, ellipsoid [[basidiospores]] of between 8 and 10 by 4 to 6&nbsp;[[micrometre]]s (\u03bcm). The spores have no ornamentation, are not [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] and have thin [[cell wall]]s. In his examinations, Takahashi did not observe any [[basidia]], but he did describe the club-shaped basidioles (immature basidia) which measured from 18 to 26 by 6 to 10&nbsp;\u03bcm. The tightly packed cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the edge of the gill) form a sterile edge to the gill, and there are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of the gill). The [[pileipellis]], the top layer of the cap, forms a [[Pileipellis#Hymeniderm|hymeniderm]], a cell structure reminiscent of the [[hymenium]] on the gills. This is made up of club-shaped cells measuring between 2 and 8 by 7 to 10&nbsp;\u03bcm, with reddish-brown, smooth cell walls up to 1&nbsp;\u03bcm thick. The [[stipitipellis]], the outermost layer of the stem, is made up of cylindrical hyphae measuring from 3 to 6&nbsp;\u03bcm in width, which run parallel to one another. They have featureless brown cell walls measuring up to 1&nbsp;\u03bcm thick, and the septa (the walls separating individual cells) have [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name=\"Takahashi\"/>\n\nThe flesh in the cap is made up of irregularly arranged cylindrical [[hyphae]] from 5 to 15&nbsp;\u03bcm wide. They stain a dark reddish-brown in [[Melzer's reagent]] or [[Lugol's solution]]. The flesh in the stem is made up of hyphae which run down the stem and measure 4 to 11&nbsp;\u03bcm in thickness. The smooth cell walls are colorless, but again stain a dark reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The septa have clamp connections.<ref name=\"Takahashi\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Marasmius subconiatus]]'', known from Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is somewhat similar to ''M.&nbsp;sasicola''. It can be differentiated as its stem does not enter the substrate, and the gills differ. In ''M.&nbsp;subconiatus'', the gills are orange, and sport cheilocystidia which are pale yellow.<ref name=\"Takahashi\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Marasmius sasicola'' is known from the lowland forests of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan, and can be found in June. Mushrooms grow in large numbers close together, and grow from dead leaves of ''[[Sasa (plant)|Sasa]]'' (grass bamboo) which have fallen.<ref name=\"Takahashi\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Marasmius species|List of ''Marasmius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~har-takah/page050.html Agaricales of Southwestern Japan] Images of [[holotype]] specimen\n\n{{Good article}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q6754917}}\n\n[[Category:Marasmius|sasicola]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 2002]]"}]}}}}

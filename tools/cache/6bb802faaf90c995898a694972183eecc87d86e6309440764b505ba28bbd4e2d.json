Widely distributed in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] across Europe, Asia, and North America, it does not occur naturally in the Southern Hemisphere, although it has been [[introduced species|introduced]] to southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil. Several closely related European mushrooms formerly thought to be [[variety (botany)|varieties]] or [[form (botany)|forms]] of ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' have been shown using [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis to be distinct species, and others previously classed as separate species are [[wikt:conspecific|conspecific]] with this species. The western North American species commonly known as the California king bolete (''Boletus edulis'' var. ''grandedulis'') is a large, darker-coloured variant first formally identified in 2007.\n\nThe fungus grows in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous forest]]s and tree [[plantation]]s, forming [[symbiotic]] [[mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] associations with living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The fungus produces [[spore]]-bearing [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] above ground in summer and autumn. The fruit body has a large brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] which on occasion can reach {{convert|35|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|3|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} in weight. Like other [[bolete]]s, it has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap, rather than gills; spores escape at maturity through the tube openings, or pores. The pore surface of the ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' fruit body is whitish when young, but ages to a greenish-yellow. The stout [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], or stem, is white or yellowish in colour, up to {{convert|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} thick, and partially covered with a raised network pattern, or [[wikt:reticulate|reticulations]].\n\nPrized as an ingredient in various foods, ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' is an [[edible mushroom]] held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or [[risotto]]. The mushroom is low in [[fat]] and digestible [[carbohydrate]]s, and high in [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral|mineral]]s and [[dietary fibre]]. Although it is sold commercially, it is very difficult to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in [[Central Europe|Central]], [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Northern Europe]], it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' is one of the few fungi sold pickled.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Bulliard00.jpg|thumb|right|Pierre Bulliard first described ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' in 1782.|alt=Side view of the head and upper body of a man wearing a dark jacket and white ruffled collar.]]\n''Boletus edulis'' was first [[species description|described]] in 1782 by the French botanist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] and still bears its original name.<ref>{{cite book |title=Herbier de la France.

''guessowii''''', commonly known as the '''American yellow fly agaric'''  is a [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] of  the genus ''[[Amanita]]''.\n\n==Description==\n\n===Cap===\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is 4.5\u201316 (18) cm wide, convex,  and becomes broadly convex to flat in age. It is bright yellow or yellow-orange, usually more orange or reddish orange towards the disc, and fading to pale yellow. The [[volva (mycology)|volva]] is distributed over the cap as cream to pale tan warts; it is otherwise smooth and sticky when wet. The margin becomes slightly striate in age. The flesh is white and it does not stain when cut or injured.\n\n===Gills===\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free to narrowly [[wikt:adnate|adnate]],  [[wikt:subcrowded|subcrowded]] to crowded, cream to pale cream, truncate, unevenly distributed, of diverse lengths, and plentiful.\n\n===Spores===\n''Amanita muscaria'' var. ''guessowii'' [[spore]]s are white in deposit, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid (infrequently [[wikt:subglobose|subglobose]] or elongate) and [[wikt:inamyloid|inamyloid]]. The spores are (7.0\u2013) 8.7-12.2 (-14.8) x (5.9) 6.5\u20138.2 (9.5) [[\u00b5m]].\n\n===Stipe===\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is (4)6 \u201315 x 1\u20133&nbsp;cm, more or less equal or narrowing upwards and slightly flaring at the apex. It is white to yellowish cream, densely stuffed with a pith, the skirtlike ring is membranous, persistent, the lower stipe and upper bulb are decorated with partial or complete concentric rings of volval material that are bright pale yellow to cream or sordid cream.\n\n===Microscopic features===\nClamps are present at bases of the [[basidium|basidia]].\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Amanita muscaria DWC 7656.jpg|thumb|left]]\n\n''Amanita muscaria'' var. ''guessowii'' is found growing solitary or [[gregariously]], it is [[mycorrhizal]] with conifers mostly but also deciduous trees as well, it is found often in the fall but sometimes in the spring, common in the northeast, from eastern Canada to North Carolina west to Michigan.<ref>http://www.shroomery.org/10224/Hunting-Fly-Agarics-in-North-America</ref>\n\n==Biochemistry==\n''Amanita muscaria'' var. ''guessowii'' contains [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]]. The amount varies from mushroom to mushroom.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+muscaria+var.+guessowii\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q585041}}\n\n[[Category:Amanita|muscaria var. guessowii]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1933]]"}]}}}}

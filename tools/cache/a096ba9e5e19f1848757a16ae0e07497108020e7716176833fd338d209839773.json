Poisonous and producing severe gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, it is commonly confused with the [[shaggy parasol]] or [[shaggy mane]], and is the most commonly consumed poisonous mushroom in [[North America]].<ref name=poisonoverview>Beug, Michael W.

The nature of the poisoning is predominantly gastrointestinal.\n\n==Description==\nIt is an imposing mushroom with a [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] (cap) up to 40&nbsp;cm in diameter, hemispherical and with a flattened top. The cap is whitish in colour with coarse brownish scales. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free and white, usually turning dark and green with maturity. It has a rare green [[spore print]]. The tall [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] may be up to 25&nbsp;cm tall and bears a ring. This mushroom lacks the snakeskin pattern that is generally present on the [[parasol mushroom]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alanmuskat.com/articles/parasol2.htm |title=How to not pass up a parasol and how not to |access-date=24 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214040731/http://www.alanmuskat.com/articles/parasol2.htm |archive-date=14 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Chlorophyllum molybdites'' grows in lawns and parks across eastern [[North America]] and [[California]], as well as temperate and subtropical regions around the world.<ref name=\"benjamin95\">{{cite book |last=Benjamin| first= Denis R. |chapter=Gastrointestinal syndrome  |title=Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas \u2014 a handbook for naturalists, mycologists and physicians |publisher=WH Freeman and Company| location=New York |year=1995|pages=351\u2013377| isbn=0-7167-2600-9}}</ref> Fruiting bodies generally appear after summer and autumn rains.

This is probably due to the fact that it is easily confused with choice edible species such as Lepiota procera and L. rhacodes, and it is one of the most common mushrooms found on lawns and pastures throughout the country, with the exception of the Pacific Northwest. When eaten raw C. molybdites produce severe symptoms, including bloody stools, within a couple of hours. When cooked well, or parboiled and decanting the liquid before cooking, others eat and enjoy it. Eilers and Nelso (1974) found a heat-labile, high molecular weight protein which showed an adverse effect when given by intraperitoneal injection into laboratory animals.''\"\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Chlorophyllum molybdites Crop 2013-09-10.jpg|In [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]]\nFile:Chlorophyllum.Molybdites.003.jpg|''Chlorophyllum molybdites''\nFile:Chlorophyllum.Molybdites.001.jpg|''Chlorophyllum molybdites''\nFile:Chlorophyllum molybdites young.JPG|''A young false parasol mushroom''\nFile:Chlorophyllum molybdites spore print.jpg|''Chlorophyllum molybdites spore print showing its green color''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n*[http://www.mushroomexpert.com/chlorophyllum_molybdites.html Mushroom Expert \u2013 ''Chlorophyllum molybdites'']\n*[http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/aug99.html Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month \u2013 ''Chlorophyllim molybdites'']\n*[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-salzman/your-yard-might-be-home-t_b_937883.html Your Yard Might Be Home to the \"Vomiter\" Mushroom | Huffington Post]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q146693}}\n\n[[Category:Poisonous fungi]]\n[[Category:Agaricaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi found in fairy rings]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Africa]]\n[[Category:Fungi naturalized in Australia]]"}]}}}}

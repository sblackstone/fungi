It gains both its [[common name|common]] and scientific name from its propensity to turn black from cutting or bruising. It is [[edible mushroom|edible]] but of indifferent quality.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIt is placed in the '''''Compactae''''' group, subsection '''''Nigricantinae'''''  by [[Bon]].<ref name = \"MarcelBon87\">{{cite book | author = Marcel Bon | year = 1987 | title = The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North Western Europe | publisher = Hodder and Stoughton | isbn = 0-340-39935-X}}</ref> It was first described by the French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] in 1798 as ''Agaricus nigricans'', before gaining its current binomial name from the father of mycology, the Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is the [[Latin]] ''nigricans'' 'blackening'.\n\n==Description==\nThis is a large member of the genus ''[[Russula]]'', and it has a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is dirty white when young, but swiftly turns brown, and then black on aging. It measures {{convert|5|\u2013|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter. There is usually a large depression in the centre of mature caps, which are three quarter peeling. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is white; firm; straight, and thick, and it too blackens with age. The [[gills]] are off-white initially, very widely spaced, and are adnate. These turn red; then grey, and finally black, when bruised. The flesh, which has a fruity smell, when cut turns pale Indian red, and then grey, and black within 20 minutes.<ref name=Phillips06/> The [[spore print]] is white, and the warty oval spores measure 7\u20138 x 6\u20137&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book| author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page= 47}}</ref>\n\nOld specimens are sometimes parasitised by fungi of the genus ''[[Asterophora]]'' or ''Nyctalis'', in particular the species ''N.&nbsp;parasitica'' and ''N.&nbsp;asterophora'' (the pick-a-back toadstool).\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n'''''Russula nigricans''''' appears in late summer and autumn in both deciduous and coniferous woodland across Britain, Northern Europe, and at least the East Coast of North America.<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nThis mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but poor. The taste becomes hot over time.\n\n==Similar species==\n''Russula anthracina'' ([[Romagn.]]), also known as ''R.&nbsp;albonigra'' ([[Julius Vincenz von Krombholz|Krombh.]]) [[Elias Magnus Fries|Fries]], has closer gills and is far less common. It lacks the red phase of colouration when the flesh is cut.<ref name = \"MarcelBon87\"/><ref name=Phillips06/>\nRussula subnigricans\n\n==See also==\n[[List of Russula species|List of ''Russula'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q639524}}\n\n[[Category:Russula|nigricans]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]"}]}}}}

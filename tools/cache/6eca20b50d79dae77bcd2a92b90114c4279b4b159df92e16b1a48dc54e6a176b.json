Although it is regarded as quite tasty, cases of [[mushroom poisoning|poisoning]] from eating ''T. equestre'' have been reported. Research has revealed it to have [[poisonous]] properties.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n''Tricholoma equestre'' was known to [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] who officially described it in Volume Two of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753, giving it the name ''Agaricus equestris'',<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Species Plantarum: Tomus II | publisher=Holmiae. (Laurentii Salvii). | date=1753| page=1173|language=la}}</ref> predating a description of ''Agaricus flavovirens'' by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon|Persoon]] in 1793. Thus this [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] meaning \"of or pertaining to horses\" in [[Latin]] takes precedence over ''Tricholoma flavovirens'', the other scientific name by which this mushroom has been known. It was placed in the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]'' by German [[Paul Kummer]] in his 1871 work ''Der F\u00fchrer in die Pilzkunde''. The generic name derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''trichos''/\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 'hair' and ''loma''/\u03bb\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1 'hem', 'fringe' or 'border'.<ref name=nilper>{{cite book | last = Nilson|first= Sven |author2=Olle Persson  | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page=24}}</ref>\n\nThe species may be in need of further analysis given the conflicting reports of toxicity.\n\nCommon names include the ''man-on-horseback'', ''yellow knight'', and ''saddle-shaped tricholoma''.\n\n== Description ==\nThe stem is yellow, usually about 4 to 10 centimetres long with an even [[diameter]]. The gills are also yellow colour and the spores are white. The cap is usually a yellow to yellow-green sometimes with a touch of brown to brown-reddish colour. The [[diameter]] is usually from 5 to 12 centimetres in length. The skin layer covering the cap is sticky and can be peeled off.\n\nIt can easily be mistaken for a variety of other members of the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]'', such as ''[[Tricholoma auratum|T. auratum]]'', ''[[Tricholoma aestuans|T. aestuans]]'' and ''[[Tricholoma sulphureum|T. sulphureum]]''.\n\n== Toxicity ==\nThis species was for a long time highly regarded as one of the tastier edible species, and sold in European markets; medieval French knights allegedly reserved this species for themselves, leaving the lowly bovine bolete (''[[Suillus bovinus]]'') for the peasants.<ref name=Lamaison05>{{cite book |title=The Great Encyclopedia of Mushrooms |last=Lamaison |first=Jean-Louis |author2=Polese, Jean-Marie  |year=2005 |publisher=K\u00f6nemann |isbn=3-8331-1239-5|page=90}}</ref>\n\nConcern was first raised in southwestern France. People who have been poisoned have all had three or more meals containing ''T. equestre'' within the last two weeks prior to treatment. One to four days after their last meal containing the fungus, the patients reported weakness of the muscles, sometimes accompanied by pain. This weakness progressed for another three to four days accompanied by a feeling of stiffness and darkening of the [[urine]]. Periods of nausea, sweating, reddening of the face were also registered, but there were no fevers.\n\nAs yet, there have been no reported cases of poisoning in North America, and there is speculation that the respective mushrooms may in fact be different species that are very similar in appearance.\n\nThere are reports where patients treated for ''T. equestre'' poisoning have died, likely as a result of the poisoning.<ref name=\"Bedry\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bedry R, Baudrimont I, Deffieux G, etal |title=Wild-mushroom intoxication as a cause of rhabdomyolysis |journal=N.

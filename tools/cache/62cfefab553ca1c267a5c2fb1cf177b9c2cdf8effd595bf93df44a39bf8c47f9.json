It is found on rotten logs, roots and tree stumps and is widely distributed.  It can also grow on sawdust and other wood waste.  Being very variable in appearance, it has been divided into several varieties or subspecies, some of which are sometimes considered species in their own right.  It is edible, but not often collected for the table.<ref name=\"Kuo\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/pluteus_cervinus.html|title=Pluteus cervinus: The Deer Mushroom|last=Kuo|first=Michael|date=December 2004|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species name, ''cervinus'', although generally thought to refer to the colour of the cap, actually refers to antler-like protrusions on its prominent thick-walled [[Pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] (of which there can be one to three).<ref name=\"Kuo\"/><ref>[http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/june98.html Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month]</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] can be up to 15&nbsp;cm in diameter, but is often much smaller.  Initially it is bell-shaped, and often wrinkled when young.  Later it expands to a convex shape. The cap can be deer-brown, but vary from light ochre-brown to dark brown, with a variable admixture of grey or black.  The centre of the cap may be darker. The cap surface is smooth and matte to silky-reflective.  The cap skin shows dark radial fibres when seen through a lens, indicating that the microscopic cuticle structure is filamentous. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially white, but soon show a distinctive pinkish sheen, caused by the ripening spores. The stipe is 5\u201312&nbsp;cm long and 0.7-2.0&nbsp;cm in diameter, usually thicker at the base.  It is covered with brown vertical fibrils on a white ground. The flesh is soft and white.  The mushroom has a mild to earthy radish smell and a mild taste at first, which may become slightly bitter.\n\nThe spore size is approximately 8\u00d75\u03bc, and the individual spores are elliptical and smooth. The spore print is salmon-pink to reddish brown.<ref name=\"Kuo\"/>\n\nIt grows on logs and stumps, and can be found most commonly in the spring and fall.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Pluteus cervinus in situ.jpg|Mature P. cervinus\nImage:Young Pluteus cervinus in situ.jpg|Young P. cervinus\nImage:Pluteus.cervinus.cystidia.400x.JPG|Cystidia with apical projections\nImage:Pluteus.cervinus.spores.1000x.jpg|''Pluteus cervinus'' spores\nImage:Pluteus cervinus01.jpg|''Pluteus cervinus''\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Pluteus species|List of ''Pluteus'' species]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*This article is partly translated from [[:de:Rehbrauner Dachpilz|the German page]].\n*Meinhard Moser: ''Basidiomycetes II: R\u00f6hrlinge und Bl\u00e4tterpilze'', Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart (1978).

The [[mushroom]] is readily identified by its irregularly shaped whitish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], fluted [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and fuzzy undersurfaces. It is found in eastern North America and in Europe, near deciduous trees in summer and autumn.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe fungus was originally described as ''Phallus crispus'' by the naturalist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] in 1772.<ref name=Scopoli1772>{{cite book |title=Flora carniolica |author=Scopoli JA. |year=1772 |volume=2 |edition=2 |page=475 |language=Italian}}</ref> Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is [[Latin]] adjective ''crispa'' 'wrinkled' or 'curly'. The generic name was originally a type of Italian herb but became associated with morels.<ref name=\"Nilper77\">Nilsson S, Persson O.(1977) ''Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill Fungi)''. pp. 36-37.

It is striking due to its irregularly shaped lobes on the cap, but with a robust creamy-white base (2\u20138\u00d71\u20132.5&nbsp;cm in size). Its [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and brittle. The stem is 3\u201310&nbsp;cm (1\u00bc\u20134&nbsp;in) long, white or pinkish in colour and ornately ribbed. It gives off a pleasant aroma, but is not edible raw. The [[spore print]] is white, the oval [[spore]]s average 19 x 11.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name = \"Phillips06\">{{cite book | author = Phillips R | year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms| publisher = Pan Macmillan Ltd|location=London| isbn=0-330-44237-6 |page=360}}</ref> Occasionally white capped forms are found. It can be distinguished from occasional white forms of ''[[Helvella lacunosa]]'' by its furry cap undersurface and inrolled margins when young.<ref name=Ammir85/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Helvella crispa'' grows in grass as well as in humid hardwoods, such as [[beech]], (not so well in resinous ones) along the side of pathways, in hedges and on the talus of meadows. They can be spotted from the end of summer until the end of autumn.<ref name=Haas69>{{cite book | last = Haas |first=Hans | year = 1969 | title = The Young Specialist looks at Fungi| publisher = Burke | isbn= 0-222-79409-7 |page=184}}</ref>\n\nIt is found in China,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Zhuang WY. |year=2004|title=Preliminary survey of the Helvellaceae from Xinjiang, China |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201342}}</ref> Japan,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Nagao H.|year=2002 |title=Fungal flora in Chiba Pref., central Japan (III) Ascomycetes: Plectomycetes and Discomycetes |journal=Journal of the Natural History Museum and Institute Chiba  |volume=5 |issue= |pages=111\u201332|language=Japanese}}</ref> Europe and eastern North America, though is replaced by the related ''[[Helvella lacunosa]]'' in western parts.<ref name=\"arora86\">{{cite book |last=Arora |first=David |authorlink=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms demystified: a comprehensive guide to the fleshy fungi |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |page=816 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\n{{see also|Gyromitra esculenta}}\nAlthough some guidebooks list this species as [[edible mushroom|edible]],<ref name = \"Phillips06\"/><ref name=Haas69/> the genus is now regarded with suspicion by many.

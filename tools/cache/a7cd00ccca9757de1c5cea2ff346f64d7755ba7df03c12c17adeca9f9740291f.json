These are presumably the areas where the host plants found refuge during the last Ice Age. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} In these areas, the search for black truffles and their cultivation is a tradition going back more than 200 years. There are large areas of natural forests where truffles are still collected manually in a traditional way. For example, the county of Alto Maestrazgo (province of Castell\u00f3n, Spain) has an ideal ground with suitable conditions for cultivating truffles. Alboc\u00e0sser, Atzaneta, Culla, or Morella are just some of the villages in this region where you can find black truffles in large amounts.<ref name=\"Slow Living Mediterr\u00e1neo\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.slowlivingmediterraneo.com/slow-food-truffle-season-spain/|title=Spanish Truffle Recipes: Slow Food and the Truffle Season in Spain|date=2017-02-09|work=Slow Living Mediterr\u00e1neo|access-date=2017-06-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, this form of recollection is increasingly affected by climate change and since the years 2010 there has been a significant drop in productivity in naturally producing forests. In exchange, cultivated areas are increasingly popular and in central Spain, several thousands of hectares (the Mecca of the black truffle being in Soria, Teruel province in the Aragon region).

The largest truffle market in France (and probably also in the world) is at [[Richerenches]] in Vaucluse. The largest truffle market in southwest France is at [[Lalbenque]] in [[Quercy]]. These markets are busiest in the month of January, when the black truffles have their highest perfume.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nProduction has considerably diminished during the 20th century, dropping to around 20 metric tonnes per year, with peaks at around 46 tonnes in the best years. By comparison, in 1937, France produced around 1,000 metric tonnes of black truffles.\n\nThe following table shows the production in the EU of Tuber melanosporum in Spain, France and Italy.

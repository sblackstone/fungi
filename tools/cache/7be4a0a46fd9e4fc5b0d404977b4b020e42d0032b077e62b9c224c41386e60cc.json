First collected in 2002 on [[Santa Cruz Island]] off the coast of [[California]], in association with [[Bishop Pine]] (''Pinus muricata''), the species was scientifically described and named in 2010. In addition to its distribution in coastal California, it was also found forming [[ectomycorrhiza]]e with the roots of pine seedlings in the eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], coastal [[Oregon]], and the southern [[Cascade Mountains]]. It resembles ''[[Suillus brevipes]]'', but can be distinguished from that species by its paler-colored  immature [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and by the tiny colored glands on the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] that darken with age.\n\n==Discovery==\n[[Basidiocarp|Fruit bodies]] of the fungus were first collected in 2002 on Santa Cruz Island, in [[Santa Barbara County]]. They were named provisionally as a new species, ''Suillus quiescens'', in conference [[proceedings]] published in 2005.<ref name=Grubisha2005/> The species was officially [[species description|described]] and named in a 2010 ''[[Mycologia]]'' publication. The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''quiescens'' refers to the organism's ability to wait dormant (''[[wikt:quiescent|quiescent]]'') in the soil until it encounters pine roots.<ref name=Bruns2010/>\n\n==Phylogeny==\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n| clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n| label1=\n| 1=''[[Suillus bellinii|S. bellinii]]''\n| 2={{clade\n     |1={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n           |1=''[[Suillus pungens|S. pungens]]''\n           |2={{clade\n              |1={{clade\n                 |1=''[[Suillus glandulosipes|S. glandulosipes]]'', ''[[Suillus neoalbidipes|S.&nbsp;neoalbidipes]]''\n                 |2=''[[Suillus granulatus|S. granulatus]]''\n                 }}\n              |2={{clade\n                 |1={{clade\n                    |1={{clade\n                       |1=''[[Suillus occidentalis|S. occidentalis]]''\n                       |2=''[[Suillus pseudobrevipes|S. pseudobrevipes]]'', ''[[Suillus volcanalis|S. volcanalis]]''\n                       }}\n                    |2=''[[Suillus luteus|S. luteus]]''\n                    }}\n                 |2=''[[Suillus brevipes|S. brevipes]]'', ''[[Suillus weaverae|S. weaverae]]''\n                 }}\n              }}\n           }}\n        |2={{clade\n           |1=''[[Suillus granulatus|S. granulatus]]'', ''[[Suillus collinitus|S. collinitus]]''\n           |2=''[[Suillus collinitus|S. collinitus]]''\n           }}\n        }}\n     |3='''''S. quiescens'''''\n    }}\n}}\n| caption=Phylogeny and relationships of ''S.&nbsp;quiescens'' and other ''Suillus'' species based on [[internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] sequences.<ref name=Bruns2010/>\n}}\nBased on [[phylogenetic]] analysis of the [[internal transcribed spacer]] region in the non-functional [[RNA]] of a number of ''Suillus'' species, ''S.&nbsp;quiescens'' is distinct from other [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar species such as ''[[Suillus brevipes|S.&nbsp;brevipes]]'', ''[[Suillus volcanalis|S.&nbsp;volcanalis]]'', and ''[[Suillus occidentalis|S.&nbsp;occidentalis]]''. The ''S.&nbsp;quiescens'' sequences, which were obtained from fruit bodies and from mycorrhizal root tips, formed a  clade.<ref name=Bruns2010/> The analysis showed that the ''S.&nbsp;quiescens'' sequences were matches to some unidentified ''Suillus'' sequences found from mycorrhizae of pine seedlings collected from Oregon<ref name=Ashkannejhad2006/> and California.<ref name=Bruns2010/><ref name=Peay2009/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Suillus brevipes 78.jpg|thumb|right|''Suillus quiescens'' resembles ''S.&nbsp;brevipes'', shown here.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] ranges in shape from hemispheric to broadly convex, and has a diameter of {{convert|6|to|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The cap color is deep brown in mature specimens and lighter shades of brown in younger mushrooms. Young specimens have a sticky layer of [[gluten]] on the cap that dries out in maturity. The edge of the cap is rolled inwards in young specimens. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the cap is whitish and does not change color when bruised or cut. The tubes on the underside of the cap are light yellow to bright orange-yellow; the tube mouths are usually less than 1&nbsp;mm wide. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is usually between {{convert|2|and|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, less frequently reaching up to {{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. It is either the same width throughout or slightly larger (bulbous) at the base. The color of the upper portion of the stipe is pale to light yellow, while the lower portion may be light brown or covered with streaks of glutinous material like that on the cap. The stipe surface is covered with fine glands that are initially slightly darker than the color of the stipe surface, but deepen to brown or nearly black after drying. The color of the [[spore print]] was not determined from the initial collections, but is thought to be yellow-brown to brown based on the accumulated spore deposit seen on the surface of the caps of neighboring fruit bodies.<ref name=Bruns2010/>\n\nThe elongate [[spore]]s are [[wikt:oblong|oblong]] in face view, with dimensions of 6.1\u201314.7 by 2.4\u20133.7&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. Most spores have a single large drop of oil in them. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are club-shaped, two- or four-spored, and measure 20.2\u201326.2 by 5.2\u20136.7&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Bruns2010/>\n\n===Similar species===\nWith its short stipe and sticky cap, ''S.&nbsp;quiescens'' is similar to ''[[Suillus brevipes|S.&nbsp;brevipes]]''. It may be distinguished from the latter species by the color of the young (light-brown) cap, the glandular dots at the top of stipes in mature specimens, and the yellowish color at the top of the stipe.<ref name=Bruns2010/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\n[[File:Pinus muricata 2.jpg|thumb|right|''S. quiescens'' forms mycorrhizal associations with Bishop Pine.]]\nFruit bodies grow together in small groups on the ground in association with [[Bishop Pine]] (''Pinus muricata''). It is the most common ''Suillus'' species on [[Santa Cruz Island]], its [[type locality (biology)|type locality]] and it has also been collected at [[Santa Rosa Island, California|Santa Rosa Island]], and [[Point Reyes National Seashore]] in California.<ref name=Bruns2010/> Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, two of the four islands that make up the northern [[Channel Islands]], have a [[Mediterranean climate]] with cool and wet winters, and warm and dry summers.<ref name=Grubisha2005/>  Most species of ''Suillus'' do not have spores that survive in the soil for extended periods of time, but the spores of ''S.&nbsp;quiescens'' can tolerate the dry conditions and heat typical of California. Another study showed that viable ''S.&nbsp;quiescens'' spores were present in steam-[[pasteurization|pasteurized]] soil planted in Oregon fields.<ref name=Warren2008/> The authors suggest that ''S.&nbsp;quiescens'' is an early [[ecological succession|successional]] species that fruits in young forests, and whose spores remain dormant in the soil for extended periods of time until the roots of a suitable pine host are encountered.<ref name=Bruns2010/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Ashkannejhad2006>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01593.x |vauthors=Ashkannejhad S, Horton TR |year=2006 |title=Ectomycorrhizal ecology under primary succession on coastal sand dunes: interactions involving ''Pinus contorta'', suilloid fungi and deer |journal=New Phytologist |volume=169 |issue=2 |pages=345\u2013354 |pmid=16411937}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bruns2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bruns TD, Grusiba LC, Trappe JM, Kerekes JF, Vellinga EC |year=2010 |title=''Suillus quiescens'', a new species commonly found in the spore bank in California and Oregon |journal=Mycologia |pmid=20361510 |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=438\u2013446 |doi=10.3852/09-149 |url=http://mollie.berkeley.edu/~bruns/papers/bruns2010a.pdf}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Grubisha2005>{{cite conference |url=http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/medn/symposia/6th%20California%20Islands%20Symposium%20%282003%29/Terrestrial%20Ecology%20and%20Restoration%20%2D%20Plants%20and%20Fungi/Grubisha_Ectomychorrhizal_Fungi_Two_Islands.pdf |title=Preliminary record of ectomycorrhizal fungi on two California channel Islands |vauthors=Grubisha LC, Trappe JM, Bruns TD |year=2005 |publisher=NPS Tech.

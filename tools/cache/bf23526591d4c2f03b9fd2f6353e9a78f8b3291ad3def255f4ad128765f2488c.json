It has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] in [[tropical]] areas, and is found in southern Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Australia, where it grows in woodlands and gardens in rich soil and well-rotted woody material. The [[sporocarp (fungus)|fruit body]] of the fungus is characterised by a conical to bell-shaped cap on a [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] and a delicate lacy \"skirt\", or [[indusium]], that hangs from beneath the cap and reaches nearly to the ground. First described scientifically in 1798 by French botanist [[\u00c9tienne Pierre Ventenat]], the species has often been referred to a separate genus ''Dictyophora'' along with other ''Phallus'' species featuring an indusium. ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' can be distinguished from other similar species by differences in [[range (biology)|distribution]], size, color, and indusium length.\n\nMature fruit bodies are up to {{convert|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tall with a conical to bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is  {{convert|1.5|\u2013|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide. The cap is covered with a greenish-brown [[gleba|spore-containing slime]], which attracts flies and other insects that eat the spores and disperse them. An [[edible mushroom]] featured as an ingredient in Chinese ''[[Chinese cuisine|haute cuisine]]'', it is used in [[stir frying|stir-frys]] and chicken soups. The mushroom, grown commercially and commonly sold in [[Asian supermarket|Asian markets]], is rich in [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[carbohydrate]]s, and [[dietary fiber]]. The mushroom also contains various [[biological activity|bioactive compounds]], and has [[antioxidant]] and [[antimicrobial]] properties. ''Phallus indusiatus'' has a [[recorded history]] of use in [[Chinese medicine]] extending back to the 7th&nbsp;century AD, and features in Nigerian folklore.\n\n==Taxonomic history==\n\n''Phallus indusiatus'' was initially described by French naturalist [[\u00c9tienne Pierre Ventenat]] in 1798,<ref name=\"Ventenat 1798\"/> and [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] under that name by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801.<ref name=\"Persoon 1801\"/> One author anonymously gave his impressions of Ventenat's discovery in an 1800 publication:\n<blockquote>This beautiful species, which is sufficiently characterised to distinguish it from every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly as far from the left bank of the river of Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder Vaillant,<ref group=N>Father of the more famous [[Fran\u00e7ois Levaillant]], explorer and ornithologist, the elder Levaillant was a merchant of Metz who served as French consul in Dutch Guiana until 1763.</ref> who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque.<ref name=\"Anonymous 1800\"/></blockquote> The fungus was later placed in a new genus, ''Dictyophora'', in 1809 by [[Nicaise Auguste Desvaux]];<ref name=\"Desvaux 1809\"/> it was then known for many years as ''Dictyophora indusiata''.<ref name=\"Kirk 2008\"/> [[Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck]] placed the species in ''Hymenophallus'' in 1817, as ''H.&nbsp;indusiatus''.<ref name=\"Nees 1817\"/> Both genera were eventually returned to [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] of ''[[Phallus (fungus)|Phallus]]'' and the species is now known again by its original name.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Hymenophallus indusiatus\"/><ref name=\"Kirk 2008\"/>\n\n[[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] described the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''rochesterensis'' in 1909, originally as a new species, ''Phallus rochesterensis''.

The cap of the Indo-Pacific species ''[[Phallus merulinus|P.&nbsp;merulinus]]'' appears smooth when covered with gleba, and is pale and wrinkled once the gleba has worn off. In contrast, the cap surface of ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' tends to have conspicuous reticulations that remain clearly visible under the gleba.

The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups in disturbed ground and among wood chips. In Asia, it grows among [[bamboo]] forests, and typically fruits after heavy rains.<ref name=\"Tuno 1998\"/><ref>Hall (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yqHA_M7BVRcC&pg=PA247 p. 247].</ref> The method of reproduction for stinkhorns, including ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'', is different from most [[agaric]] mushrooms, which [[ballistospore|forcibly eject]] their spores. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass that has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of [[carrion]].<ref name=\"Chang p.346\">Chang & Miles (2004), p. 346.</ref> The cloying stink of mature fruit bodies\u2014detectable from a considerable distance\u2014is attractive to certain insects.<ref name=\"Tuno 1998\"/> Species recorded visiting the fungus include [[stingless bees]] of the genus ''[[Trigona]]'',<ref name=\"Oliveria 2000\"/> and flies of the families [[Drosophilidae]] and [[Muscidae]]. Insects assist in spore dispersal by consuming the gleba and depositing excrement containing intact spores to [[germination|germinate]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Tuno 1998\"/> Although the function of the indusium is not known definitively, it may visually entice insects not otherwise attracted by the odour, and serve as a ladder for crawling insects to reach the gleba.<ref name=\"Kibby 1994\"/>\n\n==Edibility and cultivation==\n[[File:Bamboo pith mushroom.jpg|thumb|left|The fungus is sold dried and is usually rehydrated before cooking]]\n[[File:Tom yuea phai.jpg|thumb|left|''Tom yuea phai'' is a [[Thai cuisine|Thai soup]] made with this fungus]]\nIn eastern Asia, ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' is considered a delicacy and an [[aphrodisiac]].<ref name=\"Roberts 2011\"/> Previously only collected in the wild, where it is not abundant, it was difficult to procure. The mushroom's scarcity meant that it was usually reserved for special occasions. In the time of China's [[Qing Dynasty]], the species was collected in [[Yunnan Province]] and sent to the [[Forbidden City|Imperial Palaces]] to satisfy the appetite of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who particularly enjoyed meals containing edible fungi.<ref>Hu (2005), pp. 94\u20135.</ref> It was one of the eight featured ingredients of the \"Bird's Nest Eight Immortals Soup\" served at a banquet to celebrate her 60th birthday.

The optimal temperature for the growth of mushroom [[Spawn (biology)#Fungi|spawn]] and fruit bodies is about {{convert|24|C|F}}, with a [[relative humidity]] of 90\u201395%.<ref name=\"Yang 1987\"/> Other [[substrate (biology)|substrates]] that can be used for the cultivation of the fungus include bamboo leaves and small stems, [[soybean]] pods or stems, corn stems, and [[willow]] leaves.<ref name=\"Zhou 1989\"/>\n\nA nutritional analysis of ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) determined that the egg stage of the fungus contains (per 100&nbsp;g of fungus, [[dry matter|dry weight]]) 33.6&nbsp;g of crude [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], 1.66&nbsp;g of [[fat]], and 3.98&nbsp;g of [[carbohydrate]]s. The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9&nbsp;g [[dietary fibre]], and 88.76% [[water content|moisture]]. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including [[potassium]], [[sodium]], and [[iron]], was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the [[dietary mineral|mineral]] composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.<ref name=\"Jonathan 2008\"/>\n\n==Folklore==\nAccording to ethnomycologist [[R.

On the other side of the globe, [[New Guinea]] natives consider the mushroom sacred.<ref name=\"Spooner 1994\"/> In Nigeria, the mushroom is one of several stinkhorns given the name ''Akufodewa'' by the [[Yoruba people]]. The name is derived from a combination of the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] words ''ku'' (\"die\"), ''fun'' (\"for\"), ''ode'' (\"hunter\"), and ''wa'' (\"search\"), and refers to how the mushroom's stench can attract hunters who mistake its odour for that of a dead animal.<ref name=\"Oso 1975\"/> The Yoruba have been reported to have used it as a component of a [[Spell (paranormal)|charm]] to make hunters less visible in times of danger. In other parts of Nigeria, they have been used in the preparation of harmful charms by ethnic groups such as the [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]]  and the [[Ibibio people]]. The [[Igbo people]] of east-central Nigeria called stinkhorns ''\u00e9r\u00f3 \u1e3fma'', from the [[Igbo language|Igbo]] words for \"mushroom\" and \"beauty\".<ref name=\"Oso 1976\"/>\n\n==Bioactive properties==\nMedicinal properties have been ascribed to ''Phallus indusiatus'' from the time of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] when it was described in [[pharmacopoeia]]. The fungus was used to treat many [[inflammation|inflammatory]], [[stomach disease|stomach]], and [[neurological disorder|neural diseases]]. Southern China's [[Miao people]] continue to use it traditionally for a number of afflictions, including injuries and pains, cough, [[dysentery]], [[enteritis]], [[leukemia]], and [[feebleness]], and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for [[laryngitis]], [[leucorrhea]], fever, and [[oliguria]] (low urine output), [[diarrhea]], [[hypertension]], cough, [[hyperlipidemia]], and in anticancer therapy.<ref name=\"Ker 2011\"/> Modern science has probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits.\n\nThe fruit bodies of the fungus contain [[biological activity|biologically active]] [[polysaccharide]]s. A [[beta-glucan|\u03b2-<small>D</small>-glucan]] called T-5-N and prepared from [[alkaline]] extracts<ref name=\"Ukai 1982\"/> has been shown to have [[anti-inflammatory]] properties.<ref name=\"Hara 1982\"/> Its chemical structure is a linear chain backbone made largely of \u03b1-1\u21923 linked <small>D</small>-[[Mannose|mannopyranosyl]] residues, with traces of 1\u21926 linked <small>D</small>-mannopyrosyl residues.<ref name=\"Ukai 1980\"/> The polysaccharide has tumour-suppressing activity against [[subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneously]] implanted [[sarcoma]]&nbsp;180 (a transplantable, [[metastasis|non-metastasizing]] connective tissue [[tumour]] often used in research) in mice.<ref name=\"Hara 1982\"/><ref name=\"Ukai 1983\"/>\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Hydroxymethylfurfural.png\n| alt1 = Chemical structure of Hydroxymethylfurfural\n| caption1 = Hydroxymethylfurfural inhibits the enzyme tyrosinase.\n| image2 = Albaflavenone.png\n| alt2 = Chemical structure of Albaflavenone\n| caption2 = Albaflavenone has antibiotic properties.\n}}\n\nAnother chemical of interest found in ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' is [[hydroxymethylfurfural]],<ref name=\"Sharma 2004\"/> which has attracted attention as a [[tyrosinase]] inhibitor.

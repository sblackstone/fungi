Its specific name '''arvensis''' means 'of the field'.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:A. arvensis showing cogwheel.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Agaricus arvensis showing (the so-called) 'cogwheel' on left-hand specimen]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is similar to that of ''[[Agaricus campestris]]'' (the field mushroom). The gills are white at first (when this fungus is most often confused with deadly genus ''[[Amanita]]''). They later pass through grey and brown to become dull chocolate. There is a large spreading ring, white above but sometimes with yellowish scales underneath. Viewed from below, on a closed-cap specimen, the twin-layered ring has a well-developed 'cogwheel' pattern around the stipe. This is the lower part of the double ring.  The odor is described as like [[anise]].<ref>Miller, Orson. ''Mushrooms of North America''. New York: E.P.

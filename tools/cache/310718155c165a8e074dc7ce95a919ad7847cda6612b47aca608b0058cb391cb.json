This [[Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] fungus is an [[Edible mushroom|edible]] species that exists in a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with various species of [[Pinophyta|conifer]] as well as [[Notholithocarpus|tan oak]] and [[Arbutus|madrone]]. It belongs to the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]'' in the matsutake species complex, which includes the closely related [[East Asia|East Asian]] songi or [[matsutake]] as well as the American matsutake (''[[Tricholoma magnivelare|T. magnivelare]]'') and Mexican matsutake (''T. mesoamericanum'').<ref name=\":0\" /> ''T. murrillianum'' is also known as the '''ponderosa mushroom''', '''pine mushroom,''' and '''Western matsutake'''.\n\n\n== Edibility ==\nMatsutake mushrooms (including ''T. murrillianum'') are choice edibles with high desirability, especially in [[Asia|Asian]] markets. They are prized for their distinctive spicy odor and flavor and firm, meaty texture.\n\nSerious poisonings have occurred due to confusion with poisonous look-alikes, most notably [[Amanita smithiana]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Diaz|first=James|date=2016|title=Mistaken Mushroom Poisonings|url=https://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(15)00475-5/pdf|journal=Wilderness & Environmental Medicine|volume=27|issue=2|pages=330\u2013335|via=Wilderness & Environmental Medicine Journal|doi=10.1016/j.wem.2015.12.015|pmid=27085814}}</ref>\n\n== Harvest ==\nAs Japanese production of ''[[Matsutake|T. matsutake]]'' has declined with the growing presence of the pine-killing [[nematode]], [[Bursaphelenchus xylophilus]], there is an increasingly global matsutake harvesting market of related species. Exports from western [[North America]] bloomed over the last four decades, driving prices to a peak in the 1990s when Western matsutakes reached up to $600 per pound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1323737/matsutake-mushroom-mecca-goes-boom-bust|title=Matsutake mushroom Mecca goes from boom to bust|date=2018-12-20|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2018-12-19}}</ref> Prices have since declined dramatically, but the annual matsutake harvest still drives economies in many rural Pacific Northwest areas.\n\nButton matsutakes are especially prized, and illegal raking of wild matsutake patches can cause serious ecological damage. Matsutake harvests in the Pacific Northwest have been on the decline in recent years, possibly as a result of deep raking and over-harvesting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://today.oregonstate.edu/archives/2003/jul/proper-harvest-critical-sustaining-matsutake-industry|title=Proper harvest critical to sustaining matsutake industry|date=2009-07-08|website=Life at OSU|language=en|access-date=2018-12-19}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution ==\n''T. murrillianum'' is found predominantly in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It was previously included with the American matsutake, ''[[Tricholoma magnivelare|T. magnivelare]]'', but in 2017 scholarship based on molecular analysis separated the two and determined that ''T. magnivelare'' is limited to the eastern half of [[North America]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Trudell|first=Steven A.|last2=Xu|first2=Jianping|last3=Saar|first3=Irja|last4=Justo|first4=Alfredo|last5=Cifuentes|first5=Joaquin|date=May 2017|title=North American matsutake: names clarified and a new species described|journal=Mycologia|volume=109|issue=3|pages=379\u2013390|doi=10.1080/00275514.2017.1326780|issn=0027-5514|pmid=28609221}}</ref> In southern North America, the Mexican matsutake, [[Tricholoma mesoamericanum|''T. mesoamericanum'']], is found instead. \n\nThe Western matsutake can be distinguished from its Asian counterparts by its whiter color, and from its North American counterparts by range, which does not overlap. It is mostly white while ''T. magnivelare'' and ''T. mesoamericanum'' tend to be darker in cap coloration, though all three can stain reddish brown with handling when mature. ''T. murrillianum'' also has a smoother pileus than the eastern ''T. magnivelare''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Tricholoma_murrillianum.html MykoWeb profile of ''T. murrillianum'']\n* [http://www.matsiman.com Matsiman Matsutake Harvesting Website]\n* [https://www.mushroom-appreciation.com/matsutake.html The Marvelous Matsutake Mushroom]\n* [https://www.mssf.org/cookbook/matsutake.html Matsutake Preparation]\n* [https://www.mushroomexpert.com/tricholoma_murrillianum.html Mushroom Expert: ''Tricholoma murrillianum'']\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q47457425}}\n\n[[Category:Tricholoma]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Rolf Singer]]"}]}}}}

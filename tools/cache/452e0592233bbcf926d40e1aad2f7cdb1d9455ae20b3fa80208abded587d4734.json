It is brown in colour, with a large number of gills and a particularly thin layer of flesh in the cap. [[Mycorrhizal]], the mushroom is found from late summer to late autumn at the base of [[beech|beech trees]] in small groups or individually, where it is one of the two most common species of fungi. Alternatively, it can be found in large groups in fields, sometimes with more than a hundred individual mushrooms. It is found in Europe, and, despite previous research to the contrary, is absent in North America. Although considered edible, it is not particularly useful as food due to its [[ivy]]-like taste and the fact that more choice mushrooms will be easily found at the same time. ''L.&nbsp;subdulcis'' is known for its abundant, sweet-tasting milk that, unlike the latex of some of its relatives, does not stain fabric yellow.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n''Lactarius subdulcis'' was first described as ''Agaricus subdulcis'' by mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801,<ref>{{cite book |title= Synopsis methodica fungorum|last= Persoon|first= Christian Hendrick|authorlink= Christian Hendrik Persoon|year= 1801}}</ref> before English mycologist [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] placed it in its current genus ''[[Lactarius]]'' in 1821 in his ''The Natural Arrangement of British Plants''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Gray | first=S.

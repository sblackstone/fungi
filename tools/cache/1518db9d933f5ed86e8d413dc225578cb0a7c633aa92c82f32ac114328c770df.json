It produces small, white [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] up to {{convert|9|mm|in|sigfig=1}} in height, each with a single distinct \"head\" and \"stem\". The head is fertile, while the stem attaches to a [[sclerotium]] embedded in the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. The fruit bodies grow from dead wood, and strongly favours [[bracken]], where the species feeds [[saprotrophically]]. Though ''T.&nbsp;quisquiliaris'' was described under a different name by [[James Sowerby]] in 1803, the [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''quisquiliaris'' was [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] in 1821 by [[Elias Magnus Fries]], and the species was moved to the genus ''[[Typhula]]'', which resulted in its currently accepted [[binomial name]] by [[Paul Christoph Hennings]] in 1896. The species has been recorded in Europe and north Africa.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Typhula quisquiliaris'' was first described by [[James Sowerby]] in 1803 as ''[[Clavaria]] obtusa''. However, this name was found to be illegitimate,<ref name=\"Mycobank\"/> as it had already been given to a different species by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] in 1797.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=240327|title= ''Clavaria obtusa'' Pers. 1797|publisher= [[MycoBank]].

Fries named the species ''[[Pistillaria]] quisquiliaris'', having previously (in 1818) named it ''Clavaria quisquiliaris''.<ref name=\"Mycobank\"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''quisquiliaris'' is from the Latin meaning \"pertaining to refuse\".<ref name=\"Rea\"/><ref name=Latin>{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Ethan Allen|title=A Copious and Critical Latin-English Lexicon|year=1876|publisher=Harper & Bros|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNkEAQAAIAAJ|author2=Freund, William |accessdate=2 August 2011|page=1259|quote=quisquiliae, arum ...

[[Mycorrhizal]], it can be found growing in soil at the base of birch trees in Europe. It is typically coloured a greyish lilac, with the sometimes hollow [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] a little lighter coloured than the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]. It has crowded, decurrent gills, and smells strongly of [[coconut]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Lactarius glyciosmus'' was initially described by the Swedish [[mycologist]] [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as ''Agaricus glyciosmus'' in 1818. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''glukos'' \"sugar(y)\", and ''osmos'' \"smell\".\n\n==Description==\n[[File:2009-08-16 Lactarius glyciosmus (Fr.)

Sometimes there is a central pimple, and the cap is typically coloured a greyish lilac, sometimes varying to a pale buff. It is thin fleshed, with an incurved margin in younger specimens. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures between 25 and 65 millimetres in height, with a width between 4 and 12 millimetres. The cylindrical stem is typically widest at the bottom becoming narrower towards the top, or sometimes club shaped. The stem is concolorous with the cap, but sometimes is a little paler or with a yellowish hue. The stem is particularly soft and easily broken, and can become hollow. The flesh is buff. The gills are decurrent and crowded, and vary in colour from a pale yellowish to a pale flesh, turning to a greyish lilac with age. The [[latex|milk]] is white with an initially mild, later hot and acrid taste.<ref name=\"Phillips\">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and other fungi of Britain and Europe|last= Phillips|first= Roger|year= 1981|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page= 85}}</ref> The mushroom has a strong smell of [[coconut]]s.<ref name=\"Jordan\"/>\n\nIt is similar to ''[[Lactarius vietus|L. vietus]]'', the grey milk cap, but is differentiated by the fact ''L. vietus'' milk dries grey, while ''L. glyciosmus'' milk dries white.<ref name=\"Pegler\"/> It can also be confused with ''[[Lactarius cocosiolens|L. cocosiolens]]'', which also smells of coconuts, but ''L. cocosiolens'' has a slimy brown or orange cap and is not found among birch.<ref name=\"Kuo\">{{Cite web |url= http://www.mushroomexpert.com/lactarius_glyciosmus.html|title= Lactarius glyciosmus|accessdate=14 January 2009 |last= Kuo|first= Michael|publisher= MushroomExpert.com}}</ref>\n\nThe spore print is a creamy white colour, and the spores themselves are broadly elliptic in shape, and covered with small warts.

The best-known species are the '''deadly webcap''' (''[[Cortinarius rubellus]]'', formerly also known as ''C. speciosissimus'' or ''C. orellanoides'') and the '''fool's webcap''', ''[[Cortinarius orellanus|C. orellanus]]''.\n\nThe mushrooms' characteristics are quite common, making them difficult to identify, which often leads to [[Death|fatal]] poisonings. Young examples of the species often have a veil between the cap of the mushroom and the stem. This veil looks like a cobweb, hence the name. The veil however partially or completely disappears in older specimens. Some other characteristics for each of the mushrooms are given below.\n\n==Descriptions==\n===Deadly webcap ''(Cortinarius rubellus)''===\n''[[Spore]] color'': Rusty brown to orange<br/>\n''Cap'': 3&ndash;7&nbsp;cm rusty brown to orange. Often has a steeper and darker colored elevation at the top of the cap, but this varies greatly from specimen to specimen<br/>\n''[[Gill (mushroom)|Gills]]'': Wide gaps between the gills which can be, but are not necessarily, connected to the stem<br/>\n''Location'': Rare, but common in temperate parts of northern [[Europe]]. Has been encountered as far north as Finnish Lapland.<br/>\n''[[Habitat (ecology)|Habitat]]'': [[pine]] woods with [[Soil pH|acidic]] soil<br/>\n''Other details'': Young specimens contain a pale web between the cap and the stem. Sometimes parts of this web can be seen as a yellow ring on the stem or at the edge of the cap. The fruiting body of the mushroom blossoms from mid-summer to late autumn.\n\n''Cortinarius rainierensis'', described in 1950 by [[Alexander H. Smith|Alex H.

F.|date = 1991-03-01}}</ref> A characteristic of orellanin poisoning is the long latency; the first symptoms usually don't appear until 2\u20133 days after ingestion and can in some cases take as long as 3 weeks. The first symptoms of orellanin poisoning are similar to the common [[Influenza|flu]] ([[nausea]], vomiting, stomach pains, [[headaches]], etc.). These symptoms are followed by early stages of [[renal failure]] (immense thirst, frequent urination, pain on and around the [[kidneys]]), and eventually decreased or nonexistent urine output and other symptoms of renal failure occur. If left untreated, death will follow. There is no known [[antidote]] against orellanin poisoning, but early hospitalization and treatment can sometimes prevent serious injuries and usually prevent death. If you suspect orellanin poisoning, seek emergency medical attention.\n\nBoth of these mushrooms can be confused with each other and many incidents of [[mushroom poisoning]] have occurred where inexperienced [[Mushroom hunting|mushroom hunters]] have confused these mushrooms with [[edible mushroom]]s, such as the [[Cantharellus|chanterelle]], or [[Psilocybin mushrooms|hallucinogenic mushrooms]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Franz M, Regele H, Kirchmair M, etal |title=Magic mushrooms: hope for a 'cheap high' resulting in end-stage renal failure|journal=Nephrol.

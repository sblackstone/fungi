Described as new to science in 2010, the North American species is found on the western coast of the United States, from [[northern California]] to southern [[British Columbia]] west of the [[Cascade Range]]. A [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, it grows in a [[mutualism (biology)|symbiotic association]] with [[Douglas fir]]. It overlaps in distribution with the closely related ''[[Tuber gibbosum|T.&nbsp;gibbosum]]'', but they have different growing seasons: ''T.&nbsp;oregonense'' typically appears from October through March, while ''T.&nbsp;gibbosum'' grows from January to June. The [[ascocarp|fruit bodies]] of the fungus are roughly spherical to irregular in shape, and resemble small potatoes up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} in diameter. Inside the truffle is the [[gleba]], which is initially white before it becomes a marbled [[tan (color)|tan]] color. The large, often thick-walled, and strongly ornamented [[spore]]s are produced in large spherical [[ascus|asci]]. The truffle is highly prized for its taste and aroma. Some individuals have claimed success in cultivating the truffles in [[Christmas tree cultivation|Christmas tree farms]].\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n|clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n|label1=\n|1={{clade\n    |1={{clade\n       |1={{clade\n          |1={{clade\n             |1={{clade\n                |1=''[[Tuber gibbosum]]''\n                |2=''[[Tuber bellisporum]]''\n                }}\n             |2=''[[Tuber castellanoi]]''\n              }}\n          |2='''''Tuber oregonense'''''\n          }}\n       |2={{clade\n           |1=''[[Tuber sphaerosporum]]''\n           |2={{clade\n              |1=''[[Tuber anniae]]''\n              |2=''[[Tuber borchii]]''\n              }}\n           }}\n       }}\n    |2=''[[Tuber irradians]]''\n    }}\n}}\n|caption=Cladogram depicting the phylogenetic relationships of ''Tuber'' species in the Gibbosum clade, based on [[ribosomal DNA]] sequences.<ref name=Bonito2010/>\n}}\nThe species was first [[species description|officially described]] and named in a 2010 ''[[Mycologia]]'' article,<ref name=Bonito2010/> although ''Tuber oregonense'' had been previously used provisionally (as ''Tuber oregonense'' Trappe & Bonito)<ref name=\"Trappe106-207\"/> in American [[field guide]]s and other popular publications for several years.<ref name=Miller2006/><ref name=Ammirati2009/><ref>Hall ''et al''.

(2007), p. 123.</ref> The fungus is [[common name|commonly]] known as the Oregon white truffle. Truffle authority James Trappe initially intended to name the species as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''Tuber gibbosum'' (i.e., as ''Tuber gibbosum'' var. ''oregonense'')<ref name=Lefevre2001/> before [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis revealed that genetic differences warranted distinction at the species level.<ref name=Bonito2010/>\n\n''Tuber oregonense'' is part of the Gibbosum [[clade]] of the genus ''[[Tuber (fungus)|Tuber]]'', which contains species that have \"peculiar wall thickenings on hyphal tips emerging from the peridial surface at maturity.\"<ref name=Bonito2010/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[ascomata|fruit bodies]] of ''T.&nbsp;oregonense'' are hypogeous (growing in the ground), typically {{convert|0.5|\u2013|5|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} broad, although specimens up to {{convert|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} have been recorded. Smaller specimens are spherical or nearly so, and have random furrows; larger specimens are more irregular in shape, lobed and deeply furrowed. Young fruit bodies have a white [[peridium]], as the truffle matures it develops red to reddish-brown or orangish-brown patches; with age it becomes orange-brown to reddish-brown overall and often develops cracks on the surface. The peridium is 0.2\u20130.4&nbsp;mm thick, and the surface texture ranges from relatively smooth to covered with tiny \"hairs\" that are more dense in the furrows, and more scattered on the exposed lobes. The [[gleba]] is solid, in youth the fertile tissue is whitish and marbled with mostly narrow, white, [[hypha]]-stuffed veins that emerge throughout the peridium to its surface. In maturity, the fertile tissue is light brown to brown from the color of the spores, but the marbling veins remain white. The odor and flavor of the flesh are mild in youth, but soon become strong, pungent and complex, or \"truffly\".<ref name=Bonito2010/>\n[[image:Tuber oregonense 35390.jpg|thumb|left|A two-spored ascus; the ellipsoid spores have a honeycomb-like surface network ornamented with numerous spikes.]]\nThe [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to somewhat spindle-shaped with narrowed ends, and light brownish in color. The size of the spores varies depending upon the type of asci in which they develop: in one-spored [[ascus|asci]] they measure 42.5\u201362.5 by 17.5\u201330&nbsp;\u00b5m; in two-spored asci they are 32.5\u201350 by 15\u201325&nbsp;\u00b5m; in three-spored asci they are 27.5\u201345 by 15\u201325&nbsp;\u00b5m; in four-spored asci they are 25\u201338.5 by 13\u201328&nbsp;\u00b5m; in five-spored asci 28\u201334 by 22\u201325&nbsp;\u00b5m (all sizes excluding surface ornamentation). The spore walls are 2\u20133&nbsp;\u00b5m thick and are covered with a honeycomb-like ([[wikt:alveolate|alveolate]]) network. The cavities of the honeycomb typically have five or six sides, and the corners form spines that are 5\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m tall by 0.5&nbsp;\u00b5m thick. A \"microreticulum\" appears in some spores when the [[light microscope]] [[objective (optics)|objective]] is focused on the optical cross section but not on the spore wall surface, or on [[scanning electron microscopy]] micrographs of the surface. Young asci range in shape from spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ovoid (egg-shaped) or pyriform (pear-shaped); sometimes the base of the ascus is narrowed like a [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and measures up to 15 by 7&nbsp;\u00b5m. Mature asci are spherical to broadly ellipsoid or misshapen from the pressure of crowded spores within. They are [[hyaline]] (translucent), thin-walled, 60\u201385 by 65\u201375&nbsp;\u00b5m, 1\u20134-(occasionally 5)-spored, and astipitate (without a stipe) at maturity.<ref name=Bonito2010/>\n\nThe peridiopellis (the cuticle of the peridium) is 200\u2013300&nbsp;\u00b5m thick plus or minus 80&nbsp;\u00b5m of tightly interwoven [[hypha]]e that are 3\u20135 (sometimes up to 10)&nbsp;\u00b5m broad. The cells are short and have nearly hyaline walls that measure 0.5\u20131&nbsp;\u00b5m thick; the interior veins emerge through the peridium the cells and often form a localized tissue of rounded cells up to 12&nbsp;\u00b5m broad. The degree to which the surface is covered with fine \"hairs\" is variable; these hairs are made of tangled hyphae and emergent thin-walled hyphal tips 2\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, some even and smooth, some with [[granule (cell biology)|granulated]] surfaces and some with moniliform walls (resembling a string of beads) that are irregularly thickened by hyaline bands that are 0.5\u20132&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The subpellis (the tissue layer immediately under the pellis) is abruptly differentiated from the pellis, 150\u2013220&nbsp;\u00b5m thick, and comprises interwoven, nearly hyaline, thin-walled hyphae 2\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m wide with scattered cells up to 15&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The gleba is made of hyaline, thin-walled, interwoven hyphae that are 2\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m broad with scattered cells that are inflated up to 15&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Bonito2010/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[image:Tuber gibbosum 85548.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Tuber gibbosum'' is very similar in appearance, but is harvested in a different season.]]\n''Tuber oregonense'' closely resembles ''Tuber gibbosum'', which grows in the same habitats, but may be distinguished by the structure of its peridium, and differences in spores size and shape. Further, ''Tuber gibbosum'' grows from January to June.<ref>Trappe ''et al.'', (1997). pp. 102\u2013103.</ref>\n\n===Edibility===\n''Tuber oregonense'' is a choice [[edible mushroom|edible]] species. Its odor has been described as \"\"truffly\", a complex of garlic, spices, cheese, and \"indefinable other essences\"; the fungus is prized after by commercial truffle harvesters and consumers for its intense fragrance.<ref name=\"Trappe106-207\">Trappe ''et al''., (1997). pp. 106\u2013107.</ref> Because they grow in the topsoil and needles, they are considered to have a more \"floral\" and \"herbal\" flavor profile than related European truffles.<ref name=Mutic2010/> Some individuals have claimed to have had success in growing the truffles in [[Christmas tree farming|Christmas tree farms]] in Oregon.<ref name=Ammirati2009/> Techniques reportedly involve inoculating the ground under young Douglas fir trees with a slurry comprising ground-up truffles mixed in water, or the feces of animals fed truffles. There is, however, no concrete evidence that these methods can be used to establish new truffle patches or to improve the productivity of existing patches.<ref name=Lefevre2001/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\n{{multiple image\n| caption = The Oregon white truffle grows in a mycorrhizal relationship with Douglas fir, whose natural range is shown.\n| align=left\n| image1 = Pseudotsuga menziesii Tiger Mountain Seattle.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (120 * 2217 / 2637) round 0}}\n| caption1 =  ''Pseudotsuga menziesii''\n| image2 = Pseudotsuga menziesii levila.png\n| width2 = {{#expr: (120 * 1100/ 900) round 0}}\n| caption2 = Distribution of ''P. menziesii''\n}}\nLike all ''Tuber'' species, ''T.&nbsp;oregonense'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l. The fungus grows west of the [[Cascade Mountains]] from the southern [[Puget Sound]] region of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], south to southwestern [[Oregon]] at elevations from near sea level up to {{convert|425|m|abbr=on|-1}} in pure stands of ''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'' forests up to 100 years old, or ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'' mixed with ''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'', ''[[Picea sitchensis]]'' or ''[[Alnus]]'' species.  The species has been commercially harvested in the Pacific Northwest since the 1980s.<ref name=Lefevre2001/> and is often found in Christmas tree plantations as young as five years. The Oregon Truffle Festival, held in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] yearly since 2006 to coincide with the maturing of the truffle in late January, features activities such as cultivation seminars and truffle hunting excursions.<ref name=\"urlOTF\"/> Fruit bodies are produced from September through the middle of March.<ref name=Bonito2010/> The fungus is an important component of the diet of [[Northern flying squirrel]]s, and comprises the majority of their diet at certain times of the year.<ref name=\"urlFotM\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Tuber (fungus) species|List of ''Tuber'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Ammirati2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati J, Trudell S |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest: Timber Press Field Guide |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2009 |pages=298\u2013299 |isbn=978-0-88192-935-5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bonito2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Castellanoi G, Trappe JM, Rawlinson P, Vilgalys R |title=Improved resolution of major clades within ''Tuber'' and taxonomy of species within the ''Tuber gibbosum'' complex |journal=Mycologia |year=2010 |volume=102 |issue=5 |pages=1042\u20131057 |doi=10.3852/09-213 |pmid=20943504}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Lefevre2001>{{cite conference |title=''Tuber gibbosum'' and ''Leucangium carthusianum'': Ecology, harvesting and marketing |vauthors=Lefevre CK, Pilz D, Trappe JM, Molina A |year=2001 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Franc aise des Trufficulteurs |booktitle=Actes du 5\u00e8me Congr\u00e8s International Science et Culture de la Truffe (Proceedings of the Vth International Congress on the Science and Cultivation of Truffles and other Edible Hypogeous Mushrooms)|location=Aix-en-Provence, France |pages=4.214\u20134.217|url=http://www.natruffling.org/orwhttrf.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Miller2006>{{cite book |vauthors=Miller HR, Miller OK |title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi |publisher=Falcon Guide |location=Guilford, Connecticut |year=2006 |page=531 |isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjvXkLpqsEgC&pg=PA531}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Mutic2010>{{cite web |author=Muti\u0107 A. |title=Digging treasured truffles |date=1 November 2010 |publisher=Wine Enthusiast Magazine |url=http://www.winemag.com/Wine-Enthusiast-Magazine/Web-2010/Digging-Top-Truffles-in-Unexpected-Places/|accessdate=2010-06-16}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlFotM\">{{cite web |title=''Tuber gibbosum'', the Oregon white truffle |url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/jan97.html |author=Volk T. |website=Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month |year=1997 |publisher=University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, Department of Biology}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlOTF\">{{cite web |title=Oregon Truffle Festival |url=http://www.oregontrufflefestival.com |accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n===Cited texts===\n*{{cite book |vauthors=Trappe JM, Trappe M, Evans FB |title=Field Guide to North American Truffles: Hunting, Identifying, and Enjoying the World's Most Prized Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |location=Berkeley, California |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-58008-862-6}}\n*{{cite book |vauthors=Hall IR, Brown GM, Zambonelli A |title=Taming the Truffle: the History, Lore, and Science of the Ultimate Mushroom |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-88192-860-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/tamingtrufflehis00hall }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MycoBank|515123}}\n*[http://www.natruffling.org/faqorwht.htm North American Truffling Society] Side-by-side comparison of ''T.&nbsp;oregonense'' and ''T.&nbsp;gibbosum''\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q7850818}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi described in 2010]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Oregon culture]]\n[[Category:Truffles (fungi)]]\n[[Category:Tuber (fungus)]]"}]}}}}

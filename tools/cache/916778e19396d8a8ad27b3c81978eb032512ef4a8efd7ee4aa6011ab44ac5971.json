It is a common and abundant species in the coastal oak woodlands of [[California]], where it grows [[saprobic]]ally, feeding on the fallen leaves and acorns of various [[oak]] species. First described in 1860 by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis|Curtis]], the species was collected four years earlier during an exploring and surveying expedition. It was subsequently considered a doubtful species by later ''[[Mycena]]'' researchers, until a 1999 publication validated the taxon. ''Mycena elegantula'' is considered a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]].\n\nMaking their appearance in late autumn to early winter, the small and fragile [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are characterized by reddish-brown tones in the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and the edges of the [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]]. If cut, the mushroom tissue will \"bleed\" a deep reddish to orangish [[latex]]. As is typical of the genus ''[[Mycena]]'', caps of ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' are bluntly conical, becoming bell-shaped to convex, and eventually flatten out when old. They measure up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, and are attached to thin, hollow stems that are up to {{convert|13|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long.\n\n==History and taxonomy==\n[[image:ChWright.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Botanist Charles Wright collected the first reported specimen.]]\nThe species was originally collected for science purposes by the American botanist [[Charles Wright (botanist)|Charles Wright]] during the [[North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition]] of 1853\u201356. The single collection was found growing on fallen [[oak]] leaves at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], in [[Solano County, California]] in January 1856. The specimen was sent by American mycologist [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] to his British colleague [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]], who published a brief description of the species in 1860, calling it ''Agaricus californiensis'', in what was then the [[subgenus]] ''Mycena''. Berkeley and Curtis noted that it differed from ''A.&nbsp;aurantio-marginatus'' (known today as ''[[Mycena aurantiomarginata]]'')<ref name=\"urlFungorum - Species synonymy\"/> in the nature of the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], and they called it \"a more graceful species.\"<ref name=Berkeley1860/> In his 1887 ''Sylloge Fungorum'', [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] raised the subgenus ''Mycena'' to generic status, so the species became known as ''Mycena californiensis''.<ref name=Saccardo1887/>\n\nIn his 1947 [[monograph]] of North American ''Mycena'', [[Alexander H. Smith]] included it as an \"excluded or doubtful species\", saying that the species \"cannot be recognized until the microscopic characters of the type are known.\"<ref name=Smith1947/> Researching his 1982 monograph of ''Mycena'', [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus|Maas Geesteranus]] examined the [[holotype]] material\u2014the particular specimen designated by Berkeley and Curtis to represent the [[type (biology)|type]] of the species. Because of its deteriorated condition, however, he was unable to corroborate the distinguishing features proposed by Berkeley and Curtis, and he agreed with Smith's assessment of the species.<ref name=Geesteranus1992/>\n\nIn the late 1990s, as part of his studies on the ''Mycena'' of California, Brian Perry noted that a common species in California, usually referred to as ''Mycena elegantula'' or {{species|M|ycena|sanguinolenta}}, presented characteristics not congruent with either (in particular, ''M. elegantula'' had not previously been reported to contain latex). He compared isotype material (material collected at the same time and place as the [[holotype]]) of ''M. californiensis'' with Californian specimens and the type of ''M.&nbsp;elegantula'' and found all of them to represent the same species, publishing the results with Dennis Desjardin in their 1999 ''Mycotaxon'' article \"''Mycena californiensis'' resurrected\". Part of the confusion, they noted, was apparently due to Smith's concept of ''M.&nbsp;elegantula'' not agreeing with the species' type (something also noticed by Geesteranus).<ref name=Perry1992/>\n\nBecause ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' is the earlier name (published in 1860 vs. 1895 for ''Mycena elegantula''),<ref name=Peck1895/> it has [[Principle of Priority|priority]] over the later name ''M.&nbsp;elegantula'', according to the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|rules of botanical nomenclature]].<ref name=Perry1992/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' is initially conic or bell-shaped, but flattens out in maturity, and typically reaches dimensions of up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The cap margins (edges) are curved inwards when young, but as they age they become wavy or [[wikt:crenate|crenate]] (with rounded scallops), develop striations (radial grooves) and may even split. The surface of the cap is dull and smooth. Its color ranges from reddish brown to  brownish orange in young specimens, with the color fading as the mushroom matures; the center of the cap is usually darker than the margins. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, and either the same color as the cap or lighter; it may stain a dark red color when bruised.[[File:Mycena californiensis 72627.jpg|thumb|left|The white to light pink gills have darker-colored edges.]]The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] attachment to the stem\u2014broadly attached slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem. They are not closely spaced together, and there are about 15\u201320 of them. Some of the gills do not extend the full distance from the edge of the cap to the stem. These short gills, called ''lamellulae'', form one to two groups of roughly equal length. All of the gills have a white to pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]] color, with the gill edges ranging from reddish orange to reddish brown to brownish orange. The hollow stem is {{convert|29|\u2013|130|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, and roughly the same thickness throughout. The top of the stem may be either [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (appearing to be covered with a very fine whitish powder on a surface) or smooth, while the stem base is covered with \"hairs\" that may be strigose (large, coarse, and bristle-like) to [[wikt:downy|downy]] (soft and fuzzy). The stem is some shade of brown. The mushroom tissue will \"bleed\" a brownish-range to reddish-brown [[latex]] when it is cut.<ref name=Perry1992/> The edibility of ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' is unknown.<ref name=\"url CA Fungi\"/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nIn deposit, such as with a [[spore print]], the [[spore]]s appear white. Further details are revealed with a [[light microscope]]: the spores are [[ellipsoid]] to almond-shaped, smooth, thin-walled, and measure 8\u201312 by 4\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]] (the spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and typically have dimensions of 26\u201337.5 by 7\u201310.5&nbsp;\u03bcm. ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' has [[wikt:cheilocystidum|cheilocystidia]] ([[cystidia]] on the gill edges) that measure 16\u201350 by 6.5\u201320&nbsp;\u03bcm. These cells have irregular projections that can range in size from 1.5\u201318.8 by 1.5\u20136.5&nbsp;\u03bcm and are variously shaped, from knob-like to cylindrical. The cells contain brownish contents that will stain darkly with [[Melzer's reagent]], a common [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical reagent]] used in mushroom identification. With the exception of the medullary [[hypha]]e of the stem (longitudinally-arranged hyphae making up the stem surface), all hyphae contain [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name=Perry1992/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Potential lookalike species include ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca'' (left) and ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' (right)\n| image1    = Mycena purpureofusca 65470.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (150 * 2592 / 1944) round 0}}\n| image2    = Mycena sanguinolenta - Lindsey.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (150 * 398 / 600) round 0}}\n}}\n\n''Mycena californiensis'' may be distinguished from the closely related ''[[Mycena atromarginata|M.&nbsp;atromarginata]]'' by its smaller size and the purplish tint to the edge of the gills, and from ''[[Mycena purpureofusca|M.&nbsp;purpureofusca]]'' by its differently shaped, longer spores. Another ''Mycena'' commonly confused with ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' is ''[[Mycena sanguinolenta|M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta]]'', a species that also exudes reddish latex. It can be distinguished from ''M.&nbsp;californiensis'' by the [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] (tapering at each end) cheilocystidia that do not have outgrowths. An additional difference between the two is that ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' is associated with [[conifer]] wood and debris.<ref name=Perry1992/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nThe fruit bodies grow in clusters or scattered on the decomposing leaves and acorns of oak trees, such as [[Quercus agrifolia|Coast Live Oak]], [[Quercus lobata|Valley Oak]] and [[Quercus kelloggii|Black Oak]]. It is common in the coastal oak woodlands of California,<ref name=Perry1992/> where it appears from late autumn to early winter.<ref name=\"url CA Fungi\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=Berkeley1860>{{cite journal |author=Berkeley MJ, Curtis MA. |year=1860 |title=Characters of new fungi, collected in the North Pacific Exploring Expedition by Charles Wright |volume=4 |page=112 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/22142#112 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Geesteranus1992>{{cite book |author=Maas Geesteranus RA. |year=1992 |title=Mycenas of the Northern Hemisphere Part I.

This group of mushrooms are noted for their brittle gills and bright colours.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIt was previously named in honour of French mycologist [[Ren\u00e9 Maire]] by [[Rolf Singer]] in 1929, but found to be the same taxon as the earlier 1920 ''Russula nobilis'', which has naming priority.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is a red or rosy colour, 3\u20136&nbsp;cm wide, convex to flat, or slightly depressed, and weakly sticky. It peels only to a third of its radius, which reveals pink flesh.<ref name=Phillips06/> It is often damaged by slugs. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is 2\u20135&nbsp;cm long, 1\u20131.5&nbsp;cm wide, cylindrical, (firmer than its conifer dwelling namesake, ''[[Russula emetica]]''), and white. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are narrowly spaced, adnexed, rounded, and white, often with a faint blue-green sheen. The [[spore print]] is white.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe species is [[mycorrhizal]] with beech (''[[Beech|Fagus]]'') in woodland areas.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Thomas Laessoe. | year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref> It is widespread and common in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[North America]], where these trees grow.\n\n==Edibility==\n''Russula nobilis'' is inedible, and probably poisonous in quantity, but not deadly. Many bitter tasting red-capped species can cause problems if eaten raw; the symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature: [[diarrhoea]], vomiting and [[colic]]ky abdominal cramps. The active agent has not been identified but thought to be caused by chemical compounds known as [[sesquiterpene]]s, which have been isolated from the related genus ''[[Lactarius]]'' and from ''[[Russula sardonia]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Benjamin| first= Denis R. |title=Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas \u2014 a handbook for naturalists, mycologists and physicians|publisher=WH Freeman and Company| location=New York |year=1995| isbn=0-7167-2600-9|page=369}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of Russula species|List of ''Russula'' species]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \"Danske storsvampe.

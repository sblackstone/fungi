Unlike many other ''Amanita'' mushrooms, ''A.&nbsp;vaginata'' lacks a ring on the stem. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is gray or brownish, {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in|1}} in diameter, and has furrows around the edge that duplicate the gill pattern underneath. It has a widespread distribution in North America, and is thought to be part of a [[species complex]] that includes other similar-looking Amanitas.\n\n== Description ==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|3|to|10|cm|in|1}} in diameter and gray to grayish-brown in color; initially the cap is oval, then as it matures it becomes progressively conical, convex, and eventually flattened, sometimes with a small umbo (a rounded elevation in the center of the cap).<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, Calif |year=1986 |page=288 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=n3rVpkZII8IC&pg=PA288&dq=amanita+vaginata&lr= Google Books]</ref> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white, free (not attached to the stem) to narrowly attached, moderately crowded together, and sometimes have a grayish tint; the lamellulae (small gills that run from the edge of the cap towards the stem) are truncate.<ref name=Jenkins1986>{{cite book |author=Jenkins DB. |title=''Amanita'' of North America |publisher=Mad River Press |location=Eureka, Calif |year=1986 |page=71 |isbn=0-916422-55-0}}</ref> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white and thin, and does not change color upon bruising or injury.

The stem surface is covered with a finely powdered bloom (pruinose), especially near the top; faint longitudinal lines may be seen.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Amanita vaginata\" /> The base of the stem is enclosed in a loose, sack-like [[volva (mycology)|volva]] that may discolor grayish or reddish brown.<ref name=\"urlAmanita vaginata (MushroomExpert.Com)\" /> The [[spore print]] is white.\n\nThe variant ''A.&nbsp;vaginata'' var.

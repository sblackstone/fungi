These mushrooms are valued for their highly aromatic qualities and are used culinarily as a mere flavoring rather than as a constituent of a full meal.\n\n==Description and classification==\nCandy caps are small to medium-size mushrooms, with a [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] that is typically under 5&nbsp;cm in diameter (though ''L. rubidus'' and ''L. rufulus'' can be slightly larger), and with coloration ranging through various burnt orange to burnt orange-red to orange-brown shades. The pileus shape ranges from broadly convex in young specimens to plane to slightly depressed in older ones; [[lamella (mycology)|lamella]]e are [[wikt:attached|attached]] to [[wiktionary:decurrent|subdecurrent]]. The entire [[fruiting body]] is quite fragile and brittle. Like all members of ''Lactarius'', the fruiting body exudes a latex when broken, which in these species is whitish and watery in appearance, and is often compared to [[whey]] or nonfat milk. The latex may have little flavor or may be slightly sweet, but should never taste bitter or acrid. These species are particularly distinguishable by their scent, which has been variously compared to [[maple syrup]], [[camphor]], [[curry]], [[fenugreek]], burnt sugar, [[Malt-O-Meal]], or ''[[Maggi|Maggi-W\u00fcrze]]''. This scent may be quite faint in fresh specimens, but typically becomes quite strong when the fruiting body is dried.\n\nMicroscopically, they share features typical of ''Lactarius'', including round to slightly ovular [[spores]] with distinct [[amyloid]] ornamentation and [[sphaerocysts]] that are abundant in the pileus and stipe [[trama (mycology)|trama]], but infrequent in the [[lamellar trama]].<ref>Largent DL, Baroni TJ. 1988.

Subsection ''Camphoratini'' is defined by their similarity in color, odor (with the exception of ''L. rostratus'' \u2013 see below), and by the presence of [[cystidia|macrocystidia]] on their [[hymenium]]. (The other subsection of ''Olentes'', ''Serifluini'', is also aromatic, but have very different aromas from the ''Camphoratini'' and are entirely lacking in cystidia.)<ref name=heilmann>Heilmann-Clausen J, Verbeken A, Vesterholt J. 1998.

Those inexperienced with mushroom identification may mistake any number of [[Mushroom hunting#\"Little brown mushrooms\"|little brown mushrooms]] (\"LBMs\") for candy caps, including the [[deadly galerina]] (''Galerina marginata'' and allies), which can occur in the same habitat. Candy caps can be distinguished from non-''Lactarius'' species by their brittle stipe, while most other \"LBMs\" have a more flexible stipe. It is therefore recommended that candy caps be gathered by hand, breaking the fragile stipe in ones fingers. By this method, LBM's with a cartilaginous stipe will easily be distinguished.<ref name=campbell>Campbell D. 2004.

(scroll down)</ref>\n\nCandy caps may also be confused with any of a large number of small, similarly colored species of ''Lactarius'' that may be distasteful to downright toxic depending on the species and the number consumed.\n\nCandy caps may be distinguished from other ''Lactarius'' by the following characteristics{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}:\n\n*Odor: Candy caps have a distinctive odor (described above) that should not be present in other species of ''Lactarius''. Note, however, that other species of ''Lactarius'' may have different, but also distinctive, odors. Also note that when fresh, candy caps (especially ''Lactarius rubidus'') may not have a noticeable odor, limiting the utility of this characteristic.\n*Taste: The flesh and latex of candy caps should always be mild-tasting to somewhat sweet, lacking any hint of bitterness or acridity. Note, however, that there are some species of ''Lactarius'', such as ''L. luculentus'', where the bitterness is subtle and also may not be noticeable for a minute or so after tasting.\n*Latex: The latex of candy caps appears thin and whey-like, like milk that has been mixed with water. This latex does not change color nor does it discolor the flesh of the mushroom. Other species of ''Lactarius'' have a distinctly white or colored latex, which in some species discolors the flesh of the mushroom.\n*Pileus: Candy caps never have a [[wikt:zonate|zonate]] pattern of coloration on the surface of the pileus, nor is the pileus ever even slightly [[wikt:viscid|viscid]].\n\n[[File:Lactarius rubidus spores 1000x.JPG|thumb|Lactarius rubidus spores 1000x]]\n\n==Chemistry==\nThe chemical responsible for the distinct odor of the candy cap was isolated in 2012 by [[chemical ecologist]] and [[natural product]] [[chemist]] William Wood of [[Humboldt State University]], from collections of ''Lactarius rubidus''. The odoriferous compound found in the fresh tissue and latex of the mushroom was found to be [[quabalactone]] III, an aromatic [[lactone]]. When the tissue and latex is dried, quabalactone III is [[hydrolyzed]] into [[sotolon]], an even more powerfully aromatic compound, and one of the main compounds responsible for the aroma of [[maple syrup]], as well as that of [[curry]].<ref name=wood2012>Wood WF, Brandes JA, Foy BD, Morgan CG, Mann TD, DeShazer DA. 2012.

Biochemical Systematics and Ecology 43:51-53. {{DOI|10.1016/j.bse.2012.02.027}}.</ref>\n\nThe question of what compound was responsible for the odor of candy cap had been under investigation by Wood and various students for a period of 27 years, when a mycology student in a class he was teaching asked what compound was responsible for the mushroom's odor, triggering investigation into the question. Isolation of the compound remained elusive, until [[solid-phase microextraction]] was used to extract the volatile compounds, which were then analyzed using [[gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry]].<ref name=wood2012/><ref>Humboldt State University. 2012. Student question about mushroom\u2019s maple syrup odor takes 27 years to answer. ''Humboldt State Now'' (website). May 04, 2012.</ref>\n\nEarlier investigation of the aromatic compounds of ''L. helvus'' by Rapor, et al. had also yielded sotolon (among a large number of other aromatic compounds), which was identified as giving this species its distinct fenugreek odor. Other important volatile compounds identified included [[decanoic acid]] and [[2-methylbutyric acid]].<ref>Rapior S, Fons F, Bessiere J-M. 2000. The fenugreek odor of ''Lactarius helvus''. ''Mycologia'' 92(2): 305\u2013308. {{DOI|10.2307/3761565}}.</ref>\n\nAnalysis of ''Lactarius camphoratus'' has shown that it contains 12-hydroxycaryophyllene-4,5-oxide, a [[caryophyllene]] compound. However, this was not identified as an aromatic component of this mushroom.<ref>Daniewski WM, Grieco PA, Huffman JC, Rymkiewicz A, Wawrzun, A. 1981.

Because of the strongly aromatic quality of these mushrooms, they are instead used primarily as a  [[flavoring]], much the way [[vanilla]], [[saffron]], or [[Tuber (genus)|truffles]] are used. They impart a flavor and aroma to foods that has been compared to maple syrup or curry, but with a much stronger aroma than either of these seasonings. Candy caps are unique among edible mushrooms in that they are often used in sweet and [[dessert]] foods, such as [[cookies]] and [[ice cream]].<ref name=\"sfchronicle\" /> They are also sometimes used to flavor savory dishes that are traditionally prepared with sweet accompaniments, such as pork, and are also sometimes used in place of curry seasoning.\n\nThey are usually used in dried form, as the characteristic aroma intensifies greatly upon drying. To use them as a flavoring, the dried mushrooms are either powdered or they are infused into one of the liquid ingredients used in the dish, for example, being steeped in hot milk, much the same way whole vanilla beans are.\n\nAs a result of these culinary properties, candy caps are highly sought after by many chefs.

It is widely distributed in the [[northern hemisphere]], in [[Temperateness|temperate]] regions of Europe, North America and Asia as well as some subtropical and tropical regions of Central America and Asia. A [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, its [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] grow on the ground at the base of various species of trees from summer to autumn, either individually or in groups. It is valued as an [[edible mushroom]], and is sold in markets in Asia. Several other ''Lactifluus'' mushrooms resemble ''L.&nbsp;volemus'', such as the closely related edible species ''[[Lactifluus corrugis|L.&nbsp;corrugis]]'', but these can be distinguished by differences in distribution, visible [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and microscopic characteristics. ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' produces a white [[spore print]] and has roughly spherical [[spore]]s about 7\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre]]s in diameter.\n\nThe colour of the ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' mushroom varies from [[apricot (color)|apricot]] to [[tawny (color)|tawny]], and the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] may be up to 11&nbsp;cm ({{frac|4|1|2}}&nbsp;in) wide. The pale golden yellow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the large amount of [[latex]] (\"milk\") that it exudes when the gills are damaged, leading to the [[common name]]s '''weeping milk cap''' and '''voluminous-latex milky'''. It also has a distinctive fishy smell, which does not affect the taste. The fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several [[sterol]]s related to [[ergosterol]], some of which are unique to this species. The mushroom also contains a [[natural rubber]] that has been chemically characterized. [[Phylogenetic]] analysis suggests that ''Lactifluus volemus'' represents several species or [[subspecies]], rather than a single [[taxon]].\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe first mention of ''Lactifluus volemus'' in the scientific literature was in  [[Carl Linnaeus]]'s 1753 ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', under the name ''Agaricus lactifluus''.<ref name=Linnaeus1753/> In 1821, Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] called it ''Agaricus volemus'' in his ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]''.<ref name=Fries1821/> In this work he proposed a grouping of related species (called a ''tribus'', or tribe) within the genus ''Agaricus'', which he named ''Galorrheus''. Fries later recognised ''Lactarius'' as a distinct genus in his 1838 ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici'', citing ''Galorrheus'' as a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]].<ref name=\"urlFungorum - Species synonymy\"/><ref name=Fries1838/> Although Linnaeus had published the species before Fries, Fries's name is [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] and thus has [[Priority (nomenclature)|nomenclatural priority]]. In 1871 [[Paul Kummer]] raised most of Fries's tribes to generic rank, and so renamed the species ''Galorrheus volemus''.<ref name=Kummer1871/> The [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' var. ''subrugosus'' was identified by [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1879,<ref name=Peck1885/> but is now classified as a separate species, ''[[Lactifluus corrugis|L.&nbsp;corrugis]]''.<ref name=\"Roody\"/> In 1891, [[Otto Kuntze]] moved the species into ''Lactifluus'',<ref name=Kuntze1891/> which was afterwards long considered a synonym of ''Lactarius'' but confirmed as a separate genus through [[molecular phylogenetics]] in 2008 and subsequent taxonomical rearrangements within the family Russulaceae.<ref name=\"Buyck2008\"/><ref name=\"Buyck2010\"/><ref name=\"verbeken2013\"/>\n\nAnother historical synonym is ''Lactarius lactifluus'', used by [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] in 1886,<ref name=Quelet1886/> a renaming based on Linnaeus's ''Agaricus lactifluus''. ''Lactarius wangii'', reported by Hua-An Wen and Jian-Zhe Ying to be a new species from China in 2005,<ref name=\"Wen2005\"/> was synonymised two years later with ''L.&nbsp;volemus''.<ref name=Wang2007/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] \"''volemus''\" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''vola'',<ref name=Frieze1882/> meaning \"the hollow of the hand\", suggestive of Fries's reference to the large amount of latex \"flowing enough to fill the hand\".<ref name=\"Metzler\"/> [[Common name]]s for ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' include the weeping milk cap,<ref name=\"Arora\"/> the tawny milkcap,<ref name=Mcknight1998/> the orange-brown milky,<ref name=Russell2006/> the voluminous-latex milky,<ref name=Bessette2006/> the lactarius orange,<ref name=Lawlor1993/> the fishy milkcap,<ref name=\"urlGhent University\"/> and the apricot milk cap. In the [[West Virginia]]n mountains of the United States, the mushroom is called a \"leatherback\" or a \"bradley\". The latter name may originate from its German name ''Br\u00e4tling''.<ref name=Ternes2005/><ref name=\"Bessette2009p.5\">Bessette ''et al''.

The difficulty in discerning the two is exacerbated by the fact that both species have several colour forms: Japanese specimens of ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' may have a red cap, a yellow cap with a long stem, or a velvet-like surface texture; the caps of ''L.&nbsp;corrugis'' may be either red, commonly [[rust (color)|rust]]-coloured. In 2005, Japanese researchers clarified the relationships between these two species and others in section ''Dulces'' using [[molecular phylogenetics]], and by comparing differences in [[fatty acid]] composition, [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and taste. The colour variants group [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] into different [[clade|subclades]], suggesting that they might better be considered as \"different species, subspecies, or varieties\".<ref name=Shimono2007/> A 2010 molecular study of ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' of northern Thailand found that 79 tested specimens could be divided into 18 distinct phylogenetic species; six of these were described as new species: ''[[Lactarius acicularis|Lactifluus acicularis]]'', ''[[Lactarius crocatus|L.&nbsp;crocatus]]'', ''[[Lactarius distantifolius|L.&nbsp;distantifolius]]'', ''[[Lactarius longipilus|L.&nbsp;longipilus]]'', ''[[Lactarius pinguis|L.&nbsp;pinguis]]'' and ''[[Lactarius vitellinus|L.&nbsp;vitellinus]]''.<ref name=VandePutte2010/>\n\n==Description==\n\n===Macromorphology===\n\n[[File:Lactarius volemus 119888.jpg|thumb|right|The profuse whitish latex may become brownish upon exposure to air, and stains tissues brown.]]\n\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of ''Lactifluus volemus'' has a fleshy and firm [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] with a velvety or smooth surface and a shape that changes with maturity: it starts off convex, with edges curved inwards, then later grows flat with a depression in the middle. With a typical diameter of 5 to 11&nbsp;cm (2\u2013{{frac|4|1|2}}&nbsp;in), its colour ranges from apricot to [[tawny (color)|tawny]].<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The cap colouration, however, is somewhat variable, as has been noted in Asian,<ref name=Wang2007/> European,<ref name=Hellman-Clausen1998/> and North American specimens.<ref name=Smith1979/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], whose height varies between 4 and 12&nbsp;cm ({{frac|1|1|2}} and 5&nbsp;in), and which is typically between {{convert|1|and|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, has a slightly lighter colouration than the cap. It is firm, with a velvety or smooth surface that sometimes has depressions running longitudinally up and down its length. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[adnation|adnate]] to slightly [[decurrent]], brittle, narrow, quite closely spaced and sometimes forked. Normally a pale golden yellow colour, the gills turn brown when bruised. Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae, short gills that do not extend to the stem. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish and firm. The mushroom smells somewhat fishy;<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> one source suggests the odour is \"like a dead [[shad]], which anglers will tell you is probably the most malodorous freshwater fish\".<ref name=\"url Kuo\"/> The odour is concentrated when the fruit bodies are dried. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the abundant [[latex]], so plentiful that a small nick on the gills will cause it to \"weep\" the milky substance.<ref name=\"Arora\"/> The latex tends to impart brown stains on whatever it contacts.<ref name=\"url Kuo\"/>\n\n===Micromorphology===\n[[File:Lactarius volemus 119884.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Spores are spherical, hyaline, and reticulate.]]\n\nThe [[spore print]] is whitish. The [[spore]]s are roughly spherical, translucent ([[hyaline]]), and typically measure 7.5\u201310.0 by 7.5\u20139.0&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=\"Bessette2009p.264-66\"/> The spore surface is [[wikt:reticulate|reticulate]]\u2014covered with ridges that form a complete network. The ridges are up to 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5m high and have conspicuous projections up to 1.2&nbsp;\u00b5m high. The spore-bearing cells of the [[hymenium]], the [[basidia]], are club-shaped, hyaline, four-spored, and have dimensions of 40\u201362 by 7.2\u201310.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Montoya1996/> Interspersed among the basidia are sterile cells called [[cystidia]]. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the side of a gill) are roughly spindle- to club-shaped, and measure 48\u2013145 by 5\u201313&nbsp;\u00b5m. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of a gill) may be spindle-, club-, or awl-shaped ([[wikt:subulate|subulate]]), or intermediate in between these forms, and measure 27\u201360 by 5\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Smith1979/> Additionally, there are cystidia present on both the surface of the cap and the stem.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> If a drop of [[Iron(II) sulfate|ferric sulphate]] (used as a [[Chemical Tests used in Mushroom Identification#Iron salts|chemical test in mushroom identification]]) is applied to the mushroom flesh, it will immediately stain dark bluish-green.<ref name=\"Bessette2009p.264-66\">Bessette ''et al''.

Smith]] and [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler]] in their 1979 [[monograph]] of North American ''Lactarius'' species.<ref name=Smith1979/> This rare variety, found in the southeastern United States (ranging from [[South Carolina]] to [[Florida]] and extending west to [[Texas]]), has a cap that stays yellow throughout its development. It also has slightly smaller spores than the regular variety: 6.5\u20139.0 by 6\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=\"Bessette2009p.264-66\"/> Some authors have considered the rarely collected ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' var. ''oedematopus'', found in central and southern Europe, to be a distinct variety distinguished from the common variety by a darker reddish-brown cap and a swollen stem. This assessment is not universally accepted, possibly because it falls within the range of morphological variation shown by the main variety.<ref name=Lalli1992/>  ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' var. ''asiaticus'' was named in 2004 based on Vietnamese specimens; associating with [[Khasi Pine|Khasi pine]] (''Pinus khasya''), it has small, dull brown, velvety fruit bodies.<ref name=Doerfelt2004/> In general, little taxonomical significance has been ascribed to the several varieties of ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' that have been proposed.<ref name=VandePutte2010/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| footer = ''[[Lactifluus hygrophoroides|L.&nbsp;hygrophoroides]]'' (left) and ''[[Lactifluus corrugis|L.&nbsp;corrugis]]'' (right) are lookalikes.\n| image1 = Lactarius hygrophoroides 15959.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (150 * 593 / 600) round 0}}\n| image2 = Lactarius corrugis 54984.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (150 * 2723 / 2042) round 0}}\n}}\n''Lactifluus volemus'' is closely related to ''L.&nbsp;corrugis'', and generally similar in appearance. ''L.&nbsp;corrugis'' usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found.<ref name=\"Roody\"/> The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: ''L.&nbsp;corrugis'' has larger spores\u2014typically 10.4\u201312.8 by 9.6\u201311.8&nbsp;\u00b5m\u2014with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia.<ref name=Montoya1996/> The species ''[[Lactarius austrovolemus|Lactifluus austrovolemus]]'' is closely related, but has more crowded gills, while ''[[Lactarius lamprocystidiatus|L.&nbsp;lamprocystidiatus]]'' can only be reliably distinguished from ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller.<ref name=Wang2007/> Both ''L.&nbsp;austrovolemus''<ref name=Hongo1973/> and ''L.&nbsp;lamprocystidiatus''<ref name=Verbeken2000/> are known only from [[Papua New Guinea]].

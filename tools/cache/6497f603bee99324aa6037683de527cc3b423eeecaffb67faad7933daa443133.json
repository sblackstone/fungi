Thiers]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]] in 1976 from a specimen collected near [[Jacob Lake, Arizona]] on August 21, 1971 by amateur mycologist Charles \"Chuck\" Barrows, who had studied the mushroom in New Mexico.

The latter species is [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] when raw.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is 6\u201325&nbsp;cm (2\u201310&nbsp;in) in diameter, initially convex in shape before flattening, with a smooth or slightly tomentose surface, and gray-white, white or [[buff (color)|buff]] colour. The thick flesh is white and does not turn blue when bruised. The pores are initially whitish, later yellow. The [[spore print]] is olive brown, the [[basidiospore|spores]] are elliptical to spindle-shaped and 13\u201315 x 4\u20135&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]] in dimensions. The stout [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white with a brown reticulated pattern, and may be 6\u201320&nbsp;cm (2\u00bd\u20138 in) high with an apical diameter of 2\u20136&nbsp;cm (1\u20132&nbsp;in). Like ''B.&nbsp;edulis'', it is often found eaten by [[maggot]]s.<ref name=\"arora86\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe white king bolete is [[ectomycorrhiza]]l, found under [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') inland, and  [[coast live oak]] (''Quercus agrifolia'') closer to the west coast. Fruit bodies appear after rain, and will be more abundant if this occurs in early autumn rather than later in the year through to winter. It is abundant in the warmer parts of its range, namely [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], but also occurs in [[Colorado]] and west into [[California]].<ref name=\"arora86\"/> It has been recorded from the San Marcos Foothills in [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]].<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Holmgren M, Stone T, Kelly M | url = http://www.sanmarcosfoothills.org/Plan4/PDF/SMFC_Plan.pdf | title = A Plan for the Preservation and Stewardship of San Marcos Foothills Coalition, Santa Barbara, California | year = 2001 | pages = 1\u201394 | location = Santa Barbara | publisher = San Marcos Foothills Coalition | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-03-12 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513214513/http://sanmarcosfoothills.org/Plan4/PDF/SMFC_Plan.pdf | archivedate = 2008-05-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nIt is [[edible mushroom|edible]] and highly regarded in New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado, and was eaten for many years while assumed to be a form of ''B.&nbsp;edulis''.<ref name=\"arora86\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Boletus species|List of ''Boletus'' species]]\n*[[List of North American boletes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1102113}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boletus Barrowsii}}\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Boletus|barrowsii]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1976]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Harry Delbert Thiers]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Alexander H.

First described by [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1885, the species is found in Europe and North America, where it grows on the decaying wood and debris of [[conifer]]s, including [[conifer cone|cones]]. [[Basidiocarp|Fruit bodies]] have conical to bell-shaped purple [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} set atop slender [[stipe (mycology)|stipes]] up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long. The mushroom is named for the characteristic dark greyish-purple color of its [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] edges. In the field, ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca'' mushrooms can usually be distinguished from similar species by characteristics such as the dark purple gill edges, the deep purple cap center, and its cartilagineous consistency. The fungus contains a [[laccase]] enzyme that has been investigated scientifically for its potential to detoxify recalcitrant industrial [[dye]]s used in textile [[dyeing]] and [[printing]] processes.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] as ''Agaricus purpureofuscus'' by American [[mycology|mycologist]] [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1885. The [[type (biology)|type]] collection was made in [[Caroga, New York]], from a moss-covered trunk of [[spruce]].<ref name=\"Peck 1885\"/> [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] transferred it to ''[[Mycena]]'' in 1887, giving it the name by which it is currently known.<ref name=\"Saccardo 1887\"/> [[William Alphonso Murrill]] moved it to ''Prunulus'' in 1916,<ref name=\"Murrill 1916\"/> but this genus has since been subsumed in ''Mycena''.<ref name=\"Kirk 2008\"/> In 1879, [[Petter Karsten]] described a collection made in Scandinavia as ''Mycena atromarginata'' var. ''fuscopurpurea'', but [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus]] later placed this in [[synonym (biology)|synonymy]] with ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca''. Another synonym, according to Maas Geesteranus,<ref name=\"Maas Geesteranus 1992\"/> is ''Mycena sulcata'', described by [[Josef Velenovsk\u00fd]] in 1920 from Czechoslovakia.<ref name=\"Velenovsk\u00fd 1920\"/>\n\n[[Alexander H. Smith]] [[classification (biology)|classified]] the species in [[section (biology)|section]] ''Calodontes'', subsection ''Ciliatae'' of ''Mycena'' in his 1947 [[monograph]] on North American ''Mycena''.<ref name=\"Smith 1947\"/> [[Rolf Singer]] put it in the section ''Rubromarginata'' in his 1986 ''The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'', a group characterized by having distinct red marginate gills.<ref name=\"Singer 1986\"/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''purpureofuscus'' combines the [[Latin]] words ''purpur'' (purple) and ''fusco'' (dark or dusky).<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"purple edge bonnet\".<ref name=\"Buczacki 2012\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mycena purpureofusca 200452.jpg|thumb|left|The gill edges are colored dark greyish-purple.]]\n\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is conical to bell-shaped, flattening in age, and reaches a diameter of {{convert|0.5|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The cap margin is usually bent inwards initially. The cap surface is initially covered with tiny white hairs, but later becomes smooth. It is slightly [[hygrophanous]], and when moist, is slightly translucent, so that the outline of the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] underneath are apparent. Its color is dark purple in the center, fading to pale [[lilac (color)|lilac]] at the margins; older specimens are purplish-gray.  The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and pliant, with a texture similar to cartilage. It is initially purplish-gray, becoming pale lilac to white in age. The odor and taste of the flesh are not distinctive. The narrow gills have an ascending attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] and are narrowly [[adnation|adnate]]. They are somewhat closely spaced, with pallid to grayish face color and dark grayish purple edges that are sometimes fringed. The tubular stipe measures {{convert|3|\u2013|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by 1\u20132&nbsp;mm thick. It is tough and cartilaginous, and its base it covered with white hairs. Overall, its color is that of the cap or paler, and often paler near the top.<ref name=\"Smith 1947\"/> The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown.<ref name=\"Davis 2012\"/>\n\n[[Spore]]s are broadly [[ellipsoid]] in shape, [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and have dimensions of either 8\u201310 by 6\u20137&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] or 10\u201314 by 6.7\u20138.5&nbsp;\u00b5m depending on whether they originated from four-or two-spored [[basidium|basidia]] (spore-bearing cells), respectively. There are abundant cheilo[[cystidia]] on the gill edges. They measure 30\u201350 by 7\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m, and are fusoid-ventricose, with tips that are broadly rounded. They are filled with a purplish sap and have [[granule (cell biology)|granular]] contents. The cap tissue comprises a well-differentiated [[cap cuticle|cuticle]], a distinct hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body.<ref name=\"Smith 1947\"/> [[Clamp connection]]s in the hyphae are rare or absent.<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Mycena californiensis 72627.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (150 * 3648 / 2736) round 0}}\n| caption1 = ''Mycena californiensis'' has reddish-brown to brownish-orange gill edges.\n| image2 = Mycena rubromarginata 284929.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (150 * 2916 / 2202) round 0}}\n| caption2 = ''Mycena rubromarginata'' has a browner coloration.\n}}\n\nField characteristics that help to distinguish ''Mycena purpureofusca'' from similar species include the dark purple gill edges, the deep purple cap center, and its cartilagineous consistency. ''[[Mycena californiensis|M.&nbsp;californiensis]]'' (formerly ''M.&nbsp;elegantula'') is similar, but has gill edges colored rosy to vinaceous-brown, and its cap is browner than that of ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca''.<ref name=\"Smith 1947\"/> It has an orange to orange-brown cap, a stipe the exudes red juice when injured, and grows in lead litter under [[oak]]s.<ref name=\"Davis 2012\"/> Mitchel and Smith noted that there was considerable intergradation between the two species.<ref name=\"Mitchel 1978\"/> The [[List of bioluminescent fungi|bioluminescent]] fungus ''[[Mycena lux-coeli|M.&nbsp;lux-coeli]]'' is another allied species, but it has smaller spores (8.5\u201312 by 6.5\u20139&nbsp;\u00b5m) and its cystidia are more lobed.<ref name=\"Corner 1954\"/>  Another similar \"bleeding\" ''Mycena'' is ''[[Mycena haematopus|M.&nbsp;haematopus]]'', which usually grows in clusters on rotting wood.<ref name=\"Davis 2012\"/> In his original protologue, Peck mentioned that he considered the species closely related to ''[[Mycena rubromarginata|M.&nbsp;rubromarginata]]'', but could be distinguished by its darker color and \"non-hygrophanous striate pileus.\"<ref name=\"Peck 1885\"/> Microscopically, ''M.&nbsp;rubromarginata'' differs from ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca'' in having abundant clamp connections and narrow necks on the cheilocystidia.<ref name=\"Maas Geesteranus 1992\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[File:Mycena purpureofusca 289525.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Fruit bodies often grow on pine cones.]]\n\nThe fruit bodies of ''Mycena purpureofusca'' grow singly or in clusters on the decaying wood of conifers,<ref name=\"Smith 1947\"/> particularly spruce, [[pine]], and [[Douglas-fir]].<ref name=\"Maas Geesteranus 1992\"/> It is commonly found on decaying [[conifer cone|pine cones]].<ref name=\"Davis 2012\"/> In a European study, the fungus was found growing on logs in a state of decay where the wood was mostly hard, with most of the bark left, to wood that had decayed to the point that it was mostly soft throughout.<ref name=\"Pouska 2011\"/>\n\nIn North America, the fungus has been recorded in [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Michigan]], [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[California]],<ref name=\"Smith 1947\"/> [[Virginia]],<ref name=\"Murrill 1916\"/> and [[South Dakota]].<ref name=\"Gabel 2007\"/> In Canada, it has been found in [[Ontario]]. Smith noted that collections from Michigan are likely to be found on old [[Tsuga|hemlock]] knots lying in the soil, where it usually fruits singly; it tends to grow in clusters on logs and stumps.<ref name=\"Smith 1947\"/> In Europe, it has been recorded from Britain,<ref name=\"Emmett 1992\"/> Scotland,<ref name=\"Heritage 2006\"/> the Czech Republic,<ref name=\"Pouska 2011\"/> Poland,<ref name=\"urlgrzyby.pl\"/> Germany,<ref name=\"Gerhardt 1990\"/> and Turkey.<ref name=\"Sesli 2009\"/> In the UK, the fungus is commonly found in [[Caledonian Forest|Caledonian pine woods]],<ref name=\"Orton 1986\"/> and it is considered an [[indicator species]] for that habitat type.<ref name=\"Tofts 1998\"/>\n\n==Research==\n\n''Mycena purpureofusca'' has been investigated for its potential to decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile dyeing and [[printing]] processes, are difficult to degrade due to their highly structured organic compounds and pose a major environmental threat. The fungus [[mycelium]] produces high levels of [[laccase]], an [[oxidoreductase]] enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due to their ability to break down various recalcitrant compounds.<ref name=\"Virk 2011\"/> ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca'' laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used as a starting material in the production of polymeric dyes.\n\n[[Strobilurin|Strobilurin&nbsp;A]] has been isolated from the fruit bodies.<ref name=\"Lorenzen 1998\"/> Strobilurins have [[fungicide|fungicidal]] activities and well known for their broad fungicidal spectrum, low toxicity against mammalian cells, and environmentally benign characteristics.<ref name=\"Balba 2007\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Arora 1986\">{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |pages=906, 910 |isbn=0898151694 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Balba 2007\">{{cite journal |author=Balba H. |title=Review of strobilurin fungicide chemicals |journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part B |year=2007 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=441\u20135 |pmid=17474024 |doi=10.1080/03601230701316465}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Buczacki 2012\">{{cite book |vauthors=Buczacki S, Shields C, Ovenden D |title=Collins Fungi Guide: The Most Complete Field Guide to the Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain & Ireland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcjAML3AaNMC&pg=PT2492 |year=2012 |publisher=HarperCollins UK |isbn=978-0-00-741343-0 |page=2492}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Corner 1954\">{{cite journal |author=Corner EJH. |title=Further descriptions of luminous agarics |journal=Transactions of the British Mycological Society |year=1954 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=256\u201371 |doi=10.1016/S0007-1536(54)80009-X |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59351/0037/003/0256.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Davis 2012\">{{cite book|vauthors=Davis RM, Sommer R, Menge JA |title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America |year=2012|publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0-520-95360-4 |pages=182\u20133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=961gjLm2o9EC&pg=PA182}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gabel 2007\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gabel AC, Gabel ML |title=Comparison of diversity of macrofungi and vascular plants at seven sites in the Black Hills of South Dakota |journal=American Midland Naturalist |year=2007 |volume=157 |issue=2 |pages=258\u201396 |jstor=4500617 |doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2007)157[258:codoma]2.0.co;2}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gerhardt 1990\">{{cite journal |author=Gerhardt E. |title=Checkliste der Gro\u00dfpilze von Berlin (West) 1970\u20131990 |journal=Englera |year=1990 |page=174 |jstor=3776760 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Emmett 1992\">{{cite journal |author=Emmett EE. |title=British ''Mycena'' species \u2014 3 |journal=Mycologist |year=1992 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=165\u201373 |doi=10.1016/S0269-915X(09)80559-4}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Heritage 2006\">{{cite book |author=Scottish Natural Heritage |title=The Nature of the Cairngorms: Diversity in a Changing Environment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVp6qGygeVgC&pg=PA167 |year=2006 |publisher=The Stationery Office |isbn=978-0-11-497326-1 |page=167}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Kirk 2008\">{{cite book |vauthors=Kirk PM, Cannon PF, Minter DW, Stalpers JA |title=Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=10th |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, UK |year=2008 |page=565 |isbn=978-0-85199-826-8}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Lorenzen 1998\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lorenzen K, Anke T |title=Basidiomycetes as a source for new bioactive natural products |journal=Current Organic Chemistry |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=329\u201364 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aI_3BDcYKXgC&pg=PA336}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Maas Geesteranus 1992\">{{cite book |author=Maas Geesteranus RA. |title=Mycenas of the Norther Hemisphere.

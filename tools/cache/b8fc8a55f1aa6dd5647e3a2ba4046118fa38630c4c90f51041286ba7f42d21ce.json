In colour, it varies between liver and a dull chestnut, and the surface is dry and matt. The margin is often has tiny lobes, and can be crimped or crisped. The stem typically measures between 3 and 7 centimetres in height, and is between 4 and 8 millimetres in width. In colour, the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] varies between a reddish-brown and brick coloured. The thin layer of flesh in the cap is a white-tinged pinkish buff colour, and the stem and cap become hollow with age. The pale buff [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are slightly decurrent, and with age become a deep buff to pale ochre colour, sometimes with a slight mauve colouration. The [[latex|milk]] is white, drying yellow. The milk stains fabric a [[sulphur]] yellow colour in minutes.<ref name=\"Phillips\">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Other Fungi of Great Britain and Europe|last= Phillips|first= Roger|year= 1981|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page=88}}</ref>\n\nThe spore print is cream, while the spores themselves are broadly elliptic with large warts. Most warts are joined by thin to thickish ridges, forming a very incomplete network. Other warts are isolated. The spores measure between 8 and 9 by between 6 and 7 micrometres in volume.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/>\n\n==Edibility==\nThe fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;tabidus'' are considered inedible. The milk has bitter and acrid taste, with a slightly hot aftertaste.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The fact that the white milk dries yellow is an indicator that it may be [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]].<ref name=\"Roody\"/>\n\n==Distribution==\n''Lactarius tabidus'' can be found under [[pine tree|pine]] in autumn. It is common in southern [[Great Britain|Britain]], becoming rarer northwards.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> It can also be found in North America.<ref name=\"Roody\"/> It grows best in leaf litter or ''[[Sphagnum]]'' moss.<ref name=\"Roody\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1427410}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lactarius tabidus}}\n[[Category:Lactarius|tabidus]]\n[[Category:Inedible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1838]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Elias Magnus Fries]]"}]}}}}

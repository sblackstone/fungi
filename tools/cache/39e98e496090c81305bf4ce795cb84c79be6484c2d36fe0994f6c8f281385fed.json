It grows to 15&nbsp;cm high and has a hard, woody [[Plant stem|stem]]. The large [[cap]], which protects the blackish [[spore]]-bearing tissue, splits, and usually falls away at maturity, allowing the spores to be dispersed by wind. Large numbers may appear after soaking rains.<ref name=\"isbn1-876473-51-7\">{{cite book |author=Fuhrer BA. |title=Field Guide to Fungi |publisher=Bloomings Books Pty Ltd |location= |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-876473-51-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> It thrives in [[desert]]s and [[semi-desert]]s of [[Australia]] and other countries, often found on termite mounds in [[South Africa]]. <ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240509762_The_Genus_Podaxis_Gasteromycetes_in_Australia_with_a_Description_of_a_New_Species_from_Termite_Mounds</ref> In the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian Island]]s, it is frequently encountered along roadsides and in disturbed areas on the dry sides of the islands, especially in the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]] area of Hawaii and the [[Kihei, Hawaii|Kihei]] area of [[Maui]].\n\nOlder synonyms for this species include ''Lycoperdon pistillare'' L. (1771)  and ''Scleroderma pistillare'' (L.) Pers. (1801).\n\n==Spores==\nThe spores are usually 10\u201314 (\u201316) by (8\u2013) 9\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m broadly [[oval]] to sub-globose, smooth [[yellow]] to  deep reddish-brown with a double wall, truncate base, and apical pore. Older spore measurements have varied considerably. Species from [[Australian]] collections appear to be more subglobose than those seen from the [[United States]], raising the possibility that the latter are not the same species.\n\n==Organisation==\nIt is an [[agaric]], though it has lost hymenophoral organization and the ability to forcibly discharge its basidiospores and become \"secotioid\".<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: ''Podaxis pistillaris''\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Podaxis_pistillaris.html |title=California Fungi: ''Podaxis pistillaris'' |work= |accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> Although considered by many to be a \"stalked puffball\", ''Podaxis pistillaris'' is more closely allied with the shaggy mane (''[[Coprinus comatus]]'') than with [[puffballs]].<ref>Hopple JS, Vilgalys R. (1994). Phylogenetic relationships among coprinoid taxa and allies based on data from restriction site mapping of nuclear rDNA. ''[[Mycologia]]'' '''86'''(1): 96-107.</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nIn Australia, it was used by many desert tribes to darken the white hair in old men's whiskers and for body painting. The fungus was presumably used by many desert [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] due to its distribution around drier areas of [[Australia]]. There are reports of its also being used as a fly repellent. Apart from the more common, ground-inhabiting Podaxis pistillaris, there is one other Podaxis species in Australia - [[Podaxis]] beringamensis, found on termite mounds and presumably both species were used.<ref>Arpad Kalotas in Fungi of Australia, Volume 1B. http://www.anbg.gov.au/fungi/aboriginal.html</ref>\n\n''Podaxis pistillaris'' is also used as food in [[Middle East]] and [[Mexico]]<ref>[https://medcraveonline.com/JBMOA/JBMOA-05-00137 Current and potential use of the desert fungus Podaxis pistillaris (l.) fr.

It is found growing in small groups on leaf litters in association with beech. All mushroom guidebooks as well as the [[mushroom hunters|mushroomers]] advise that the entire genus should be avoided. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] (''i.e.'', the [[mushrooms]]) appear in spring and summer; the bell-shaped [[Pileus (mycology)|caps]] are generally pale pinkish in colour with red stains, with a reddish-pink [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] and [[Lamella (mycology)|gill]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe red-staining inocybe was first [[species description|described]] by Norwegian naturalist [[Axel Gudbrand Blytt]] in 1904 as ''Inocybe erubescens''. However, it was widely known for many years as ''I.&nbsp;patouillardii'', as named by Italian mycologist [[Giacomo Bresadola]] in 1905 in honour of the French botanist [[Narcisse Th\u00e9ophile Patouillard]]. However, the former name takes [[Principle of Priority|priority]] due to age.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is hemispherical before flattening out and can reach 8&nbsp;cm (3.4&nbsp;in) in diameter. It is variable in colour, initially white though becoming yellow or brownish with age, and stained with pink-white and red marks or lines. The edge of the cap is often irregular with split edges and rough texture. The adnexed [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are reddish-pink. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], dark red-pink, is thin with no [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is initially yellowish, later dark pink. The colour tends to fade in direct sunlight. It may be mistaken for ''[[Calocybe gambosa]]'', though the latter does not stain red, ''[[Agaricus]]'' species or ''[[Cortinarius caperatus]]''.<ref name=\"Zeitl76\">{{cite book|author=Zeitlmayr L|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms:An Illustrated Handbook|publisher=Garden City Press, Hertfordshire|isbn=0-584-10324-7|page=77}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nIt is commonest in [[beech]] woods and chalky soils, but grows in other broad-leaved woodland as well. It mainly grows on leaf litter usually during the spring and summer seasons. It is found in southern Europe and has been recorded from eastern [[Anatolia]] in Turkey.<ref name=Dem04>{{cite journal|vauthors=Demirel K, Uzun Y, Kaya A |year=2004 |title=Some Poisonous Fungi of East Anatolia |journal=Turkish Journal of Botany |volume=28 |pages=215\u201319 |url=http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/botany/issues/bot-04-28-1-2/bot-28-1-2-23-0207-2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505044124/http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/botany/issues/bot-04-28-1-2/bot-28-1-2-23-0207-2.pdf |archivedate=2005-05-05 }}</ref> In Israel, ''I. erubescens'' grows under Palestine oak (''[[Quercus calliprinos]]'') and pines, with mushrooms still appearing in periods of little or no rain as they are mycorrhizal.<ref name=\"Lurie09\">{{cite journal|last=Lurie|first=Yael|date=2009|title=Mushroom poisoning from species of genus Inocybe (fiber head|journal=Clinical Toxicology |volume=47|issue=6|pages=562\u201365 | doi=10.1080/15563650903008448}}</ref>\n\n==Toxicity==\n''Inocybe erubescens'' contains the toxin [[muscarine]], in much higher doses than ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', and has been known to cause death.<ref name =\"Benjamin95\">Benjamin DR.

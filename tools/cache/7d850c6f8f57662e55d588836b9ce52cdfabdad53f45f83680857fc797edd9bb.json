Also known as the '''sweating mushroom''', it derives this name from the symptoms of poisoning. It contains potentially deadly levels of [[muscarine]].\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n''Clitocybe dealbata'' was initially described by  [[United Kingdom|British]] [[natural history|naturalist]] [[James Sowerby]] in 1799 as ''Agaricus dealbatus'',<ref>See [[:File:Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms - t. 123.png]] for the plate which is the original definition of this species.</ref> its specific epithet derived from the [[Late Latin]] verb ''dealbare'' 'to whitewash',<ref>{{cite book  | last = Simpson  | first = D.P.  | title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.  | year = 1979   | edition = 5 | location = London  | pages = 883  | isbn = 0-304-52257-0}}</ref> inexorably calling to mind the Biblical \"whited sepulchre\", that is outwardly pleasing but inwardly toxic.

W H Freeman & Co. {{ISBN|0-7167-2649-1}}</ref>\n\n==Toxicity==\nThe main toxic component of ''Clitocybe dealbata'' is [[muscarine]], and thus the symptoms are those of [[nerve agent]] poisoning, namely greatly increased [[saliva]]tion, sweating ([[perspiration]]), and tearflow ([[lacrimation]]) within 15\u201330&nbsp;minutes of ingestion. With large doses, these symptoms may be followed by [[Abdomen|abdominal]] pain, severe [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], blurred vision, and labored breathing. Intoxication generally subsides within two hours. [[Death]] is rare, but may result from  arrhythmia or [[respiratory failure]] in severe cases. The specific [[antidote]]s are [[CHRM1|M1 receptor]] blockers like [[atropine]], [[scopolamine]] or [[diphenhydramine]].<ref name =\"Benjamin95\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of deadly fungi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic2863.htm Toxicity, Mushrooms - Muscarine]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1402263}}\n\n[[Category:Clitocybe|dealbata]]\n[[Category:Deadly fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi found in fairy rings]]\n[[Category:Poisonous fungi]]"}]}}}}

Known by the common name of the '''rufous milkcap''', or the '''red hot milk cap''' in [[North America]]. It is dark brick red in color, edible, and grows with [[pine]] or [[birch]] trees.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nDescribed originally by [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]], and later by the Swedish father of modern mycology [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''rufus'' is a reference to its colour.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is up to {{convert|10|cm|in}} in diameter. It is dark brick, bay, or red-brown.  At first it is convex, and often has a small central boss (umbo), but later flattens, eventually acquiring a shallow central depression. The surface is dry and matt. The concolorous, but paler  [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]  often becomes hollow with age. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are slightly decurrent, cream, becoming coloured as the cap later, only paler. The [[spore print]] is creamy white, with a slight salmon tinge. The flesh is white, as is the milk, which tastes mild initially, gradually becoming very hot, and acrid after a minute or so.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Lactarius rufus'' appears from late spring to late autumn. It is frequent in the northern [[temperate]] zones in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].  It is most commonly found with [[pine]] trees, but can also appear with [[birch]], or [[spruce]]. It is common in northern [[California]], and the [[Pacific Northwest]] from late summer to early winter.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Edibility==\n''Lactarius rufus'' is generally not recommended for consumption.<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, Calif |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-4ajFDPlxgC&pg=PA35&dq=Lactarius+rufus&lr=#v=onepage&q=Lactarius%20rufus&f=false Google Books]</ref><ref name=Roody2003>{{cite book |author=Roody WC. |title=Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Ky |year=2003 |page=102 |isbn=0-8131-9039-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=5HGMPEiy4ykC&pg=PA84&dq=Lactarius+rufus&lr=#v=onepage&q=Lactarius%20rufus&f=false Google Books]</ref> However, it is used in some places as a condiment after special treatment,<ref name=Phillips06/> and mycologist [[David Arora]] notes that it is eaten in Scandinavian countries after canning, and also mentions that there may be edibility differences in North American and European versions of the mushroom.<ref name=Arora1986/>  It is one of the most common wild mushrooms harvested for food in Finland.<ref name=\"Ohenoja 1984\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ohenoja E, Koistinen R|date=1984|title= Fruit body production of larger fungi in Finland. 2: Edible fungi in northern Finland 1976\u20141978|journal=Annales Botanici Fennici|volume=21|issue=4|pages=357\u201366|jstor=23726151}}</ref>\n\nIn order to eat these mushrooms, you will have to cook them approximately 10 minutes in plenty of water. After this, you can either preserve them in vinegar or salt water or freeze them lightly salted. These mushrooms make a great salad, with mayonnaise, cream and onions.\n\nBe careful when tasting for identification purposes, and only take a tiny piece. The delayed action effect masks an extremely hot (maybe '''the''' hottest) mushroom.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1323764}}\n\n[[Category:Lactarius|rufus]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]"}]}}}}

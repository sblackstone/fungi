It was originally described as ''Simblum periphragmoides'' in 1831, and has been known as many different names before being transferred to ''Lysurus'' in 1980. The [[saprobic]] fungus has a [[pantropical]] distribution, and has been found in Africa, Asia, Australasia, and the Americas, where it grows on fertile ground and on [[mulch]]. The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]], which can extend up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, consists of a reddish latticed head (a receptaculum) placed on top of a long stalk. A dark olive-green [[spore]] mass, the [[gleba]], fills the interior of the lattice and extends outwards between the arms. Like other members of the [[Phallaceae]] family, the gleba has a [[wikt:fetid|fetid]] odor that attracts flies and other insects to help disperse its spores. The immature \"egg\" form of the fungus is considered [[edible mushroom|edible]].\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n[[File:Dictybole-texensis.jpg|left|180px|thumb|A sketch of \"''Dictybole texensis''\", a deteriorated specimen of ''L.&nbsp;periphragmoides'' thought by Atkinson to be a new species.<ref name=Atkinson1902/>]]\nThe [[basionym]] for this species is ''Simblum periphragmoides'', first described by German mycologist [[Johann Friedrich Klotzsch]] in 1831, based on specimens collected in Bois Ch\u00e9ry in [[Mauritius]]. Klotzsch designated it as the [[type species]] of ''Simblum'',<ref name=Hooker1831/> a genus differentiated from the similar genus ''[[Lysurus]]'' by having the fruit body ending in a spherical, chambered head, with [[gleba]] developing within the depressions of the chambers.<ref>Miller and Miller (1988), p. 82.</ref> ''Lysurus periphragmoides'' is a [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] variable species; as a result, it has acquired an extensive number of [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]], as various authors have decided that the different forms warranted being designated as new species. [[Donald Malcolm Dring]]'s 1980 [[monograph]] on the Clathraceae (a [[family (biology)|family]] that has since been [[wikt:subsume|subsumed]] into the [[Phallaceae]]<ref>Kirk ''et al.'' (2008), p. 148.</ref>) transferred the taxon to ''Lysurus'', explaining \"a distinction between \"''Simblum''\" and ''Lysurus'' in the original restricted sense cannot be easily maintained because there are examples of intermediates states\", and he lumped 18 synonyms under ''L.&nbsp;periphragmoides''.<ref name=Dring1980/>\n\nIn one noted example of an author being too eager to assign a new name, in 1902 [[George Francis Atkinson]] described a specimen he found in [[Texas]], otherwise similar to ''Simblum'' but with a loose net drooping from the head; he initiated the new genus ''Dictybole'' to include his \"new\" species ''D.&nbsp;texense''.<ref name=Atkinson1902/> The species was, according to mycologist [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]], merely a decomposing or insect-damaged specimen of ''L.&nbsp;periphragmoides'' that had been preserved in alcohol. Lloyd criticized Atkinson's poor judgment in his self-published journal ''Mycological Notes'',<ref name=Lloyd1909/> and later, humiliated him under the [[pen name]] N.J.&nbsp;McGinty.<ref name=Money2002/> [[William H. Long]] later (1907) transferred Atkinson's taxon to the genus ''Simblum'', claiming that the yellow arms and longer spores were sufficiently distinct to consider it distinct from ''L.&nbsp;periphragmoides'' (then known as ''Simblum sphaerocephalum'');<ref name=Long1907/> however, according to Dring, ''D.&nbsp;texense'' should also be considered a synonym of ''L.&nbsp;periphragmoides''.<ref name=Dring1980/> Despite Dring's renaming, and the subsequent acceptance of his subsuming of the genus ''Simblum'' into ''Lysurus'',<ref>Kirk ''et al.'' (2008), p. 634.</ref> the species is still occasionally referred to ''Simblum sphaerocephalum''.<ref name=\"urlLysurus periphragmoides (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''periphragmoides'' means \"fenced in all around\", and refers to the latticed structure of the cap.<ref name=Metzler1992/> The fungus is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"stalked lattice stinkhorn\" or \"chambered stinkhorn\".<ref name=McKnight1987/>\n\n==Description==\n\nImmature fruiting bodies of ''L.&nbsp;periphragmoides'' start as round or oval \"eggs\" that may be up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=Arora1986/> On the underside of the egg are whitish [[rhizomorph]]s that anchor it to the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]].<ref>Miller and Miller (1988), p. 90.</ref> The [[peridium]] is white to [[buff (color)|buff]]-colored on the external surface, and has a gelatinous layer inside. An egg cut in half lengthwise reveals internal layers, including a tough white outer peridium, and a thick layer of firm, translucent, gelatinous matter transversed by strands ([[trabeculae]]) of denser white tissue. The strands are [[anastomosing]] partitions, connecting with the peridium externally and with the bars of the receptaculum within. The gelatinous layer is therefore divided up into many irregular longitudinal chambers.<ref name=Conard1913/>\n[[File:Lysurus periphragmoides 83532.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Close-up of latticed receptaculum]]\nThe egg eventually ruptures as the stalk expands and breaks through, creating a [[volva (mycology)|volva]] at the base of the stipe. In maturity, the fruit bodies, are up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, with a latticed spherical [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] (the receptaculum) atop a long yellow or reddish [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]].<ref name=Dring1980/> In general, [[Old World]] specimens tend to be yellow, while [[New World]] specimens are reddish, although exceptions have been noted in the literature. The receptaculum is typically {{convert|1.5|\u2013|3.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and forms a red or orange lattice, or mesh.<ref name=Arora1986/> There are typically between 20 and 100 small pentagonal to hexagonal meshes in the receptaculum; the arms of the mesh have sharp ridges on the outer surface, [[wikt:corrugated|corrugations]] on the sides, and are flat to weakly ridged on the inner surface.<ref name=Dring1980/> The internal surfaces of the receptaculum are covered with an olive-green [[spore]]-bearing [[gleba]], which sometimes seeps through the mesh holes. Like most stinkhorn species, the gleba has a foul odor, comparable to rotten meat,<ref name=\"urlRogers\"/> but it is \"less-offensive\" than most. The smell of fresh, newly exposed gleba has been reported to be sweet, similar to [[amyl acetate]];<ref name=Long1942/> the foul odor forming only after it has been exposed to air for some time.<ref name=Metzler1992/> The stipe is {{convert|5|\u2013|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|0.8|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and is hollow and spongy.<ref name=Arora1986/> The walls of the stipe are made of an inner layer of large tubes and two or three outer layers of small tubes. Specimens may occasionally be found with fused heads on two separate stipes arising from a single volva.<ref name=McKnight1987/>\n\nA [[variety (botany)|variety]] with a white fruit body is known, ''Lysurus periphragmoides'' var. ''albidum'' (originally described as ''Simblum texense''  var. ''albidum'' by Long<ref name=Long1942/>).<ref name=Dring1980/> It was reported growing from sandy [[alkaline soil]] in [[semi-arid]] regions of [[New Mexico]],<ref name=Long1942/> but has not been reported again since Long's collections in 1941.<ref name=Dring1980/>\n\n[[Spore]]s are elliptical or oblong in shape, smooth, [[inamyloid]], and have dimensions of 3.5\u20134.5 by 1.5\u20132.5 [[micrometre|\u00b5m]].<ref name=Metzler1992/> The use of [[scanning electron microscopy]] has revealed that ''L.&nbsp;periphragmoides'' (in addition to several other Phallales species) has a hilar scar\u2014a small indentation in the surface of the spore where it was previously connected to the [[basidium]] via the [[sterigma]].<ref name=Burk1982/>\n\nLike many of the stinkhorns, ''L.&nbsp;periphragmoides'' is generally considered only [[edible mushroom|edible]] when in its immature \"egg\" form.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''Lysurus periphragmoides'' is morphologically distinct, and unlikely to be confused with any other species. Within the genus ''Lysurus'',  ''[[Lysurus mokusin|L.&nbsp;mokusin]]'' has an angular stipe and a receptacle of four to five clasped arms, contoured like the stipe with alternating ribs and furrows. ''[[Lysurus cruciatus|L.&nbsp;cruciatus]]'' has a rounder stipe with receptacle arms that are not clasped together at maturity. The receptacle of ''[[Lysurus gardneri|L.&nbsp;gardneri]]'', found in south-east Asia, India, and Africa, is made of five to seven reddish-brown fingers that are initially pressed together before separating.<ref name=Dring1980/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\nThis species is typically found growing solitary or in groups on lawns, [[mulch]], pastures, and open woods.<ref name=\"urlLysurus periphragmoides (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/> A North American [[field guide]] notes an association with apple orchards and cornfields.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n''Lysurus periphragmoides'' has a [[pantropical]] distribution. The fungus has been reported from Africa ([[Mauritius]], [[Tanzania]]),<ref name=Dring1980/> Asia ([[Jilin Province]], China,<ref name=ChenGuang2006/> Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia), Australasia (New Guinea), North America (Bahamas, Dominica,<ref name=Dring1980/> Mexico<ref name=Guzman1984/><ref name=Vasquez1988/>) and South America (Argentina,<ref name=DeToledo1995/> Brazil, and Venezuela). The distribution extends north to the [[Ryukyu Islands]] in Asia.<ref name=Dring1980/> It is fairly common in South America, but is usually restricts its appearance to periods of wet weather in southern North America.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=776 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Atkinson1902>{{cite journal |author=Atkinson GF. |year=1902 |title=Three new genera of higher fungi |journal=Botanical Gazette |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=36\u201343 |doi=10.1086/328258}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Burk1982>{{cite journal |vauthors=Burk WR, Flegler SL, Hess WM |year=1982 |title=Ultrastructural studies of Clathraceae and Phallaceae (Gasteromycetes) spores  |journal=Mycologia |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=166\u201368 |doi=10.2307/3792646 |jstor=3792646}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ChenGuang2006>{{cite journal |title=Notes on macrofungi in Baicheng Region of Jilin Province |journal=Journal of Jilin Agricultural University |year=2006 |vauthors=ChenGuang G, JingHua C |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=244\u201328 |issn=1000-5684}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Conard1913>{{cite journal |title=The structure of ''Simblum sphaerocephalum'' |journal=Mycologia |year=1913 |volume=5 |issue=5 |author=Conard HS. |pages=264\u201373 |jstor=3753269 |doi=10.2307/3753269}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=DeToledo1995>{{cite journal |author=de Toledo, LD. |title=Gasteromycetes (Eumycota) del Centro y Oeste de la Argentina.

First described scientifically by American mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1912, the species has been juggled by various authors to several [[genus|genera]], including ''[[Boletus]]'', ''[[Boletellus]]'', and ''[[Xerocomus]]''. Found solely in western North America from [[British Columbia]] south to [[Mexico]], the fruit bodies are distinguished by their dark reddish brown to nearly black [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] with uneven surfaces, the yellow pores on the underside of the caps, and the red-streaked yellow [[stipe (mycology)|stems]]. The fungus grows in summer and autumn on the ground, often in [[Douglas fir]] forests or on their margins. The development of the [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] is gymnocarpic, meaning that the [[hymenium]] appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n''Xerocomellus zelleri'' was first described by American mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1912, based on specimens he found on the campus of the [[University of Washington]].<ref name=Murrill1912a/> Murrill named it ''Ceriomyces zelleri''<ref name=Murrill1912a/> before switching the genus later that year to ''[[Boletus]]''.<ref name=Murrill1912/> In 1944, [[Walter Henry Snell]] thought the taxon would be more appropriate in the genus ''[[Xerocomus]]''.<ref name=Snell1944/> In 1959, mycologists [[Rolf Singer]], Snell and [[Esther A. Dick]] transferred the species to ''[[Boletellus]]'', explaining that the microstructure of the [[trama (mycology)|trama]] and the faint ornamentation of the spores were inconsistent with placement in ''[[Xerocomus]]''.<ref name=Snell1959/> American mycologist [[Harry D. Thiers]], in his 1976 [[monograph]] on North American boletes, claimed that he failed to consistently find ornamentation on the spores of material he collected, and preferred to retain the species in ''Boletus''.<ref name=\"urlCA Boletes -- Boletus zelleri\"/> In 2011, it was moved to the genus ''Xerocomellus.<ref name=\"Klofac 2011\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''zelleri'' was chosen by Murrill to honor Professor [[Sanford Myron Zeller]], mycologist at [[Oregon State University]]. Zeller accompanied Murrill in his [[Seattle]] expedition, and discovered the first specimens of the mushroom.<ref name=Murrill1912a/><ref name=Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is typically between {{convert|5|\u2013|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, initially convex but flattening somewhat in maturity.<ref name=Bessette1987/> It is fleshy, with an uneven velvety surface, and dark brown to nearly black; the margin of the cap is a pale cream color. Young specimens are covered by a grayish bloom.<ref name=Tylutki1987II/>\n\n[[File:Boletus zelleri 1621.JPG|thumb|left|The yellow to dirty yellow flesh inconsistently bruises blue when cut or broken.]]\nThe tubes that comprise the undersurface of the cap (the [[hymenium]]) are up to {{convert|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and angular, yellow, becoming dirty yellow and finally greenish-yellow;<ref name=Tylutki1987II/> there are 1\u20132 pores per millimeter on the hymenium surface.<ref name=Miller2006/> They do not change color when bruised, although they may turn slightly brownish when exposed to the air for a time. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is yellow to dirty yellow, up to {{convert|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick,<ref name=\"urlCA Boletes -- Boletus zelleri\"/> and inconsistently bruises blue when cut or broken.<ref name=Arora1986/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|1|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and swollen toward the base. The stem surface is red or yellowish with red lines, often white or yellow at the base, and solid (that is, not hollow), with fibrous flesh; in maturity the stem ages to yellowish-red to dark red.<ref name=Bessette1987/> The [[spore print]] is olive-brown; one source notes that creating a spore print may result in \"a lot of yellow juice on the paper\".<ref name=Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991/>\n\nThe [[basidiospores|spores]] are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] in shape, smooth, and have dimensions of 12\u201316 by 4\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]],<ref name=Tylutki1987II/> although occasionally there will be some \"giant spores\" with lengths of up to 24&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=\"urlCA Boletes -- Boletus zelleri\"/> The [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells, are 26\u201335 by 9.5\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m, and four-spored. The [[cystidia]] are roughly cylindrical and thin-walled, with dimensions of 38\u201377 by 5.5\u201314.8&nbsp;\u00b5m. There are no [[clamp connection]]s present in the [[hypha]]e.<ref name=Snell1959/> The fruit body tissue stains a greenish color when a drop of [[ammonia]] solution is applied.<ref name=Bessette2001/>\n\n===Edibility===\n\n''Xerocomellus zelleri'' is an [[edible mushroom|edible]] species,<ref name=Ammirati1987/> although care should be taken to ensure that specimens collected for consumption are free of fly larvae.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Boletus zelleri\"/> In his book ''100 Edible Mushrooms'', Michael Kuo gave the mushroom an edibility rating of \"mediocre\".<ref name=Kuo2007/> There is no distinguishable odor, and the taste is alternately described as pleasant,<ref name=\"urlRogers Mushrooms\"/> mild,<ref name=Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991/> or \"slightly acidic\".<ref name=Tylutki1987II/> The original species description noted that the texture was \"slightly [[mucilaginous]]\".<ref name=Murrill1912a/> The mushroom is suitable for preserving or drying,<ref name=Bandoni1976/> or as a \"filler\" to add bulk to a dish.<ref name=Kuo2007/> It is harvested and sold commercially in local markets in [[British Columbia, Canada]].<ref name=Berch2003/>\n\n===Similar species===\n\nThe red-cracked bolete (''[[Xerocomellus chrysenteron]]'') has an olive-brown cap that cracks, exposing flesh that ages to pinkish red. ''[[Boletellus chrysenteroides]]'', found only in eastern North America, has a velvety to smooth, dark reddish brown, cracked cap with pale exposed flesh.<ref name=Bessette1987/>\n\n==Fruit body development==\n[[File:Xerocomellus zelleri 60764.jpg|thumb|right|A collection from Banner Forest, [[Kitsap County, Washington]], USA]]\nIn 1914, Zeller published a study of the development of the mushroom, made possible by the prolific fruiting of the fungus in [[Seattle]] in the fall of 1912. Development was studied by examining thin sections of tissues in different stages of development, and the differentiation of tissues and structures followed by using [[staining|histological stains]].<ref name=Zeller1914/> The growth form of ''Xerocomellus zelleri'' is called gymnocarpic, meaning that the [[hymenium]] appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane. In this type of development, the cap is formed from hyphae at the top of the stem and subsequently expands by growth along the margins; the hymenium forms later beneath the cap in a direction away from the center.<ref name=Watling1981/>\n\nThe mushrooms originate as minute fruit bodies (called \"pins\" due to their shape) from a yellow mycelium that forms a mat and tends to engulf pine needles. The pins, typically 1\u20132&nbsp;mm in diameter, lengthen vertically until they are roughly three or four times longer than they are thick. Until this point, the fruit body is a homogenous mass of tissue. It differentiates simultaneously into cap and stem along a cleavage plane (an axis along which any cell division occurs) from the outside inward, which gives rise to deep furrow encircling the fruit body. The hymenium is formed in the roof of this furrow, growing inward and upward from the outside edge. The cap develops from the upper section of this division, the stem from the lower.<ref name=Zeller1914/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[File:Boletus zelleri.JPG|thumb|left|In [[Lincoln County, Oregon]]]]\nThis species grows solitarily or in small groups on the ground or in [[forest floor|forest duff]] in mature [[coniferous forest]]s, occasionally abundant on grassy edges of the forest, rarely on badly decayed conifer logs. It is an [[Mycorrhiza#Types of mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] mushroom, meaning that the fungal [[hypha]]e form sheaths around the rootlets of certain trees, exchanging nutrients with them in a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship. The fungus associates with [[alder]], [[Populus|poplar]] and other [[hardwood]]s,<ref name=Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991/> and has been shown in [[microbiological culture|laboratory culture]] to form ectomycorrhizae with Western Hemlock (''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'').<ref name=Kropp1982/> However, the fungus may have [[saprobic]] tendencies, as it has been noted to grow under [[California Redwood]] (sometimes in the rotted wood of old trunks), a tree not known to form mycorrizhae.<ref name=Kuo2007/><ref name=\"urlBoletus zelleri (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/> It is known to form long [[rhizomorphs]] (aggregations of hyphae that resemble roots), and has been noted to be more abundant in sites with buried wood than without.<ref name=Cline2005/> In British Columbia, it occurs from summer to early winter, although it also appears infrequently in early spring.<ref name=Bandoni1976/> In California, the mushroom often fruits after the rainy period in autumn through to March or April.<ref name=\"urlCA Boletes -- Boletus zelleri\"/> The dark coloring of the cap make this species difficult to notice, \"unless a glimpse of the yellow hymenium is obtained\".<ref name=Murrill1912a/> Fruit bodies are eaten by the [[American shrew-mole]].<ref name=Terry1978/>\n\n''Xerocomellus zelleri''  is distributed in North America in the [[Pacific Northwest]] south to California and Mexico.<ref name= Sept2006/> In Mexico, it has been reported in high-altitude [[cloud forest]]s of [[Mexican Beech]] (''Fagus mexicana''), a rare and endangered habitat.<ref name=RodriguezRamirez2010/> It has also been reported from [[Tibet]],<ref name=\"url\u6cfd\u52d2\u725b\u809d\u83cc Boletus zelleri Murr.\"/> but this may be based on a misidentification.\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Xerocomellus zelleri'' has been shown to contain the [[phenethylamine]] alkaloid compounds [[tyramine]], [[N-methyltyramine|''N''-methyltyramine]], and [[hordenine]], although the [[chemotaxonomy|chemotaxonomic]] significance of this is not clear.<ref name=Grundon1977/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of North American boletes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Ammirati1987>{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati JF, McKenny M, Stuntz DE |title=The New Savory Wild Mushroom |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle, Washington |year=1987 |page=11 |isbn=0-295-96480-4}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |pages=518\u20139 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-RmabYsjI4C&pg=RA1-PA518}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bandoni1976>{{cite book |title=Guide to Common Mushrooms of British Columbia |vauthors=Bandoni RJ, Szczawinski AF |year=1976 |publisher=British Columbia Provincial Museum |location=Vancouver, Canada |pages=173\u20134}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Berch2003>{{cite book |vauthors=Berch SM, Cocksedge W |title=Commercially important wild mushrooms and fungi of British Columbia: what the buyers are buying.

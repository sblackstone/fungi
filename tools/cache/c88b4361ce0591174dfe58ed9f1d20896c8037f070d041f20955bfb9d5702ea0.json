[[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke|Cooke]] proposed in 1871 another name still in use today \u2014 ''Lepista personata''. Other names were to follow, namely ''Lepista saeva'' by P.D. Orton in 1960 and ''Clitocybe saeva'' by H.E. Bigelow & A.H. Smith in 1969, the latter placing the fungus in the larger genus ''[[Clitocybe]]''.<ref name=taxonomists>{{cite web | title=''Lepista personata'' taxon record details at Index Fungorum | publisher=CAB International | url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=445547|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}</ref> In [[Latin]], the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''s\u00e6vus'' is an [[adjective]] meaning either fierce, outrageous, angry or strong.

The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is at first hemispherical or convex, becoming almost flat with maturity, up to 16&nbsp;cm in diameter. The cap cuticle is colored cream to light brown with a smooth texture to the touch, and is often seen glistening when fresh. Along the periphery, the cap ends in a thick incurved margin which may unfold as the mushroom expands. The white to pallid [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick, firm and delicate upon slicing. The underside of the cap bears crowded pinkish, cream to light brown [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]], which are free or emarginate in relation to the stem. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] itself is cylindrical with a bulbous, or sometimes tapering base, and does not bear a [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The stem is covered by a striking lavender or lilac-coloured fibrous skin which fades in older individuals, and has a thick, firm flesh concolorous with that of the cap. It is up to 6\u20137&nbsp;cm tall and 2.5\u20133&nbsp;cm in diameter.<ref name=Bas1995/><ref name=Yordanov>{{cite book |author1=Yordanov L. |author2=Vanev S. |author3=Fakirova V. |title=The Fungi in Bulgaria (\u0413\u044a\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f)|publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] |location=Sofia |year=1978 |page=182 |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nUnder a light microscope, the spores are seen hyaline to pink, ellipsoid in shape, and with fine warts.

''L. personata'' produces a pale pink [[spore print]].<ref name=Bas1995/><ref name=Yordanov/>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n''Lepista personata'' is found fruiting in open grasslands, parks, pastures, forest clearings, and in the vicinity of forest edges, unlike ''Lepista nuda'' which is commonly found in woodland. ''Lepista personata'' fruits gregariously, forming distinctive [[fairy ring]]s.<ref name=Bas1995/><ref name=Yordanov/> Its fruiting season extends from summer to the beginning of winter, and is widespread in [[Europe]].<ref name=Bas1995>{{cite book |author=Bas C. |title=Flora Agaricina Neerlandica : Critical Monographs on Families of Agarics and Boleti Occurring in the Netherlands Vol. 3|publisher=CRC Press |location= |year=1995 |page=74 |isbn=90-5410-616-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NGGiXsS9eYwC&pg=PA67&dq=neerlandica+saeva&lr=#v=onepage&q=saeva&f=false|accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref> In the UK, the season extends from September through to December.

This is particularly likely if the mushroom is consumed raw, though allergic reactions are known even from cooked blewits.\n\nField blewits should therefore be cooked before eating, as the consumption of raw specimens could lead to [[indigestion]]. Blewits can be eaten as a cream sauce or [[Saut\u00e9ing|saut\u00e9ed]] in [[butter]]; they can also be cooked like [[tripe]] or as an [[omelette]] filling.<ref name=\"Mabey01\" />\n\nField blewits are often infested with fly larvae and don't store very well; they should therefore be used soon after picking. They are also very porous, so they are best picked on a dry day.<ref name = \"Mabey01\">{{cite book | author = Mabey, Richard | year = 2004 | title = Food for Free | publisher = HarperCollins | isbn = 0-00-718303-8 | authorlink = Richard Mabey}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Lepista personata|Field blewit}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090107023310/http://mushroom-collecting.com/mushroomblewits.html \"Mushroom-Collecting.com - The Blewit\"]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0898153883&id=87ct90d4B9gC&pg=RA31-PA2&lpg=RA31-PA2&ots=4Oo62AG8Ni&dq=arora+rain+blewit&sig=xpRtrfWu5owPFMtACE-hKALD77A#PRA31-PA2,M1 All that Rain Promises and More - Blewit]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q25379773}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lepista Personata}}\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Lepista]]\n[[Category:Tricholomataceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi naturalized in Australia]]\n[[Category:Fungi found in fairy rings]]"}]}}}}

Its appearance is that of a typical \"[[little brown mushroom]]\": small, brown and indistinct. However, it is distinguishable by its microscopic features, particularly its long, smooth [[spore]]s. As with many other species of ''Inocybe'', ''I.&nbsp;lacera'' contains the poisonous chemical [[muscarine]] which, if consumed, can lead to [[salivation]], [[lacrimation]], [[urination]], [[defecation]], [[gastrointestinal problem]]s and [[emesis]]. Found in Europe and North America, it typically grows in autumn in [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed woods]], favouring sandy soil. There are several documented [[subspecies]] in addition to the main ''I.&nbsp;lacera'' var ''lacera'', including the dwarf form ''I.&nbsp;lacera'' var. ''subsquarrosa'' and ''I.&nbsp;lacera'' var. ''heterosperma'', found in North America.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Inocybe lacera'' was first described by Swedish [[Mycology|mycologist]] [[Elias Magnus Fries]], but was placed into the genus ''Inocybe'' by [[Paul Kummer]]<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> in his 1871 work, ''Der F\u00fchrer in die Pilzkunde''.<ref name=\"Kuo\"/> As several forms of the species are recognised, the main variety is sometimes known as ''Inocybe lacera'' var.

It is not uncommon in Northern Europe and until 1981 examples were probably simply considered to be ''H.&nbsp;sacchariolens''.<ref name=Funga/>\n\nLike the latter it is a nondescript clay brown or ochre mushroom with somewhat viscid cap, up to about {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and has a strong sweet odour which has been likened to orange blossom or [[amyl acetate]].<ref name=Bon/>  It is distinguished from ''H. sacchariolens'' by \n*its ecology with [[willow]] and [[alder]] in boggy ground (as opposed to forests and gardens with broad-leaved trees in general), and\n*its large [[spore]] size of 13\u201317 \u00d7 7\u20139 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]] (as opposed to 11\u201314 \u00d7 6\u20138&nbsp;\u03bcm).<ref name=Funga/>\n\nThe name ''gigaspermum'' means \"giant-spored\".\n\nThe edibility of the mushroom is not known for certain, but ''[[Hebeloma]]'' contains [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] species and it is not to be recommended for culinary use.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Funga>{{cite book |last=Knudsen |first=Henning |author2=Jan Vesterhout |title=Funga Nordica |publisher=Nordsvamp |location=Copenhagen |year=2008 |page=816}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Groeger1981>{{cite journal |author=Gr\u00f6ger F, Zschieschang G. |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mykologie |year=1981 |title=''Hebeloma''-Arten mit sacchariolens-Geruch |volume=47 |pages=195\u2013210 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bon>{{cite book |author=Bon M.|title=The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North-Western Europe |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |isbn=0-340-39935-X}}.

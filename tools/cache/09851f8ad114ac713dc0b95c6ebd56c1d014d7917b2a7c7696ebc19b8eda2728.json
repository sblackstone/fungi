Common names for it include '''scaly lentinus''' and '''train wrecker'''.\n\n==Appearance==\n''Neolentinus lepideus'' fruit bodies are tough, fleshy, [[agaric]]s of variable size. The cap is at first convex and flattens with maturity while the margin remains inrolled. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] may grow up to about 12&nbsp;cm, while the [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] grows to about 8&nbsp;cm in height.<ref name=\"jordan\">{{cite book | author = Michael Jordan | year = 1995  | title = The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe | publisher = David & Charles | isbn = 978-0-7153-0129-6|page=329}}</ref> The white, cream to pale-brown cap cuticle is distinctively covered with concentrically arranged dark scales which become denser towards the depressed cap centre. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white and their attachment to the stem is adnate to subdecurrent or decurrent. The [[Spore print|spore mass]] is white and the [[spore]]s are cylindrical in shape. The spore dimensions are 8-12.5 by 3.5-5&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Bas1988>{{cite book |author=Bas C. |title=Volume 2 of Flora Agaricina Neerlandica: Critical Monographs on Families of Agarics and Boleti Occurring in the Netherlands | publisher=CRCPress | location=  | year=1990 | pages=90\u201391 | isbn=978-90-6191-971-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-xGzC7Nic4C&pg=PA27&dq=neerlandica+lepideus&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe stem bears the same coloration as the cap and is also covered in dark scales in the region below the white [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]].\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nFruiting bodies  of ''Neolentinus lepideus'' are found singly or in tufts emerging from dead and decaying [[conifer]]ous wood, favouring [[Pinus|pines]] (''Pinus'') including old [[Tree stump|stump]]s, [[logging|log]]s and [[timber]]. It may also be found in gardens, on man-made wooden structures such as old [[railroad tie]]s, and in such unusual places as [[coal mine]]s. Less frequently, it is also found on non-coniferous [[hardwood]]. The fungus's fruiting season is spring to autumn and it is common in Europe and North America.<ref name=Bas1988/><ref name=\"rogersmushrooms\">{{cite web | title=''Lentinus lepideus'' at Rogers Mushrooms | publisher=Rogers Plants Ltd | url=http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~6280.asp | accessdate=January 3, 2010 }}</ref> There have also been multiple reports of its occurrence in the Western Cape, South Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispotnature.org/node/825596|title=Lentinus lepideus|access-date=2016-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==Importance==\n''Neolentinus lepideus'' has a [[saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]] mode of nutrition and is an important woodland [[decomposer]] and a cause of [[wet rot]] in building materials. The fungus has shown tolerance of wood treated with [[creosote]] and other preservatives, and has been used in experiments to evaluate the efficacy of treatment methods.<ref name=\"57.pdf\">{{cite journal | author=Duncan C., Deverall F. |year=1963 | title=Degradation of Wood Preservatives by Fungi | journal=Applied Microbiology | volume=12 | issue= 1| pages=57\u201362 | pmid=16349644 | pmc=1058065}}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nWhile some authors qualify ''Neolentinus lepideus'' as edible,<ref name=rogersmushrooms/> others describe it as inedible.<ref name=jordan/> Despite there being no recorded poisonings, because fruitbodies of it tend to grow on human-made wooden structures, the fungus may come in contact with hazardous chemicals, like wooden [[railroad tie]]s smeared with [[creosote]].\nFruiting bodies have a flesh with a tough consistency which increases with maturity.

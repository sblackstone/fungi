This variant may be distinguished from ''[[Amanita muscaria|A. muscaria]]'' by its peach-colored center and its eastern North American distribution.\n\n==Controversy==\nRecent DNA evidence has shown ''Amanita persicina'' to be a distinct species from ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' and was elevated to species status in 2015 by Tulloss & Geml.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amanita persicina - Amanitaceae.org - Taxonomy and Morphology of Amanita and Limacella|url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20persicina|website=www.amanitaceae.org|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n''Amanita persicina'' has a pleasant taste and odor.  It is both psychoactive and poisonous if not properly prepared by parboiling. It should not be eaten without further research. [http://davidarora.com/uploads/rubel_arora_muscaria_revised.pdf]\n\n===Cap===\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is 4\u201313&nbsp;cm wide, hemispheric to convex when young, becoming plano-convex to plano-depressed in age. It is pinkish-melon-colored to peach-orange, sometimes pastel red towards the disc. The cap is slightly [[wikt:appendiculate|appendiculate]]. The [[volva (mycology)|volva]] is distributed over the cap as thin pale yellowish to pale tannish warts; it is otherwise smooth and [[wikt:subviscid|subviscid]], and the margin becomes slightly to moderately striate in age. The flesh is white and does not stain when cut or injured.\n\n===Gills===\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free, crowded, moderately broad, creamy with a pale pinkish tint, and have a very floccose edge. They are abruptly truncate.\n\n===Spores===\n''Amanita persicina'' [[spore]]s are white in deposit, ellipsoid to elongate, infrequently broadly ellipsoid, rarely cylindric, [[wikt:inamyloid|inamyloid]], and are (8.0) 9.4\u201312.7 (18.0) x (5.5) 6.5\u20138.5 (11.1) [[micrometre|\u00b5m]].\n\n===Stipe===\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 4\u201310.5&nbsp;cm long, 1\u20132&nbsp;cm wide, and more or less equal or narrowing upwards and slightly flaring at the apex. It is pale yellow in the superior region, tannish white below, and densely stuffed with a pith; the ring is fragile, white above and yellowish below, and poorly formed or absent. Remnants of the [[universal veil]] on the vasal bulb as concentric rings are fragile or absent.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Amanita persicina'' is found growing solitary or [[gregariously]], it is [[mycorrhiza]]l with conifers (Pine) and deciduous (Oak) trees in North America. It is found often in the fall but sometimes in the spring and summer in the southern states. It is common in the southeast United States, from Texas to Georgia and north to New Jersey.\n\n==Biochemistry==\nThis species contains variable amounts of the neuroactive compounds [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Amanitamuscariavarpersicina1.jpg| ''Amanita muscaria var. persicina'' \nImage:amanita muscaria var. persicina.jpg| ''Amanita muscaria var. persicina''</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+persicina ''Amanita persicina'' page by Rod Tulloss]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Miller, O.

Its ellipsoid, inamyloid spores also help to distinguish it.<ref name=MushroomExpert>{{cite web| url = http://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita_spreta.html | title = ''Amanita spreta''|work=MushroomExpert.com |accessdate=2016-10-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Cap ===\n\nThe [[Cap (mycology)|cap]] of ''A. spreta'' measures around  58 \u2013 154&nbsp;mm (5.8 - 15.4&nbsp;cm) wide, with whitish or pallid tints of gray and/or brown at first, often darkening to gray-brown or brown-gray, often darkest in the center, often white or nearly white at the margin, having minute colorless spots and/or giving the impression of densely placed radial fibers embedded in the cap skin. In addition, the cap is broadly campanulate to plano-convex, and eventually has a large [[Umbonate|umbo]] in a slight depression.  The cap is viscid to tacky and dull to shiny to subshiny with drying, and it has a decurved, short-[[striate]] margin. The [[volva (mycology)|volva]] is either absent or present as white to pale gray, scant, irregular patches, soft to smooth, easily removable, and membranous.  The flesh is white, pale brown under the cap skin in the center, is 8 \u2013 17&nbsp;mm (0.8 - 1.7&nbsp;cm) thick over the stem, and is thinning evenly nearing the margin.<ref name=Amanitaceae>{{cite web | url = http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20spreta | title = ''Amanita spreta''|work=Amanitaceae.org |accessdate=2016-10-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Gills ===\n\nThe gills are free, receding at maturity, very crowded to crowded, pale cream to cream to white, 8 \u2013 19&nbsp;mm broad, broadest at the midpoint, anastomosing, with faint and short decurrent lines on the top of the stem, and with a minutely powdery edge.  The short gills are truncate to rounded truncate to subtruncate, unevenly distributed, of diverse lengths, and plentiful (sometimes more plentiful than full-length gills).  The short gills can be adjacent to the stipe or adjacent to the cap margin or neither.<ref name=\"Amanitaceae\"/>\n\n=== Stem ===\n\nThe stem of ''A. spreta'' is 5\u201310&nbsp;cm long, up to 2&nbsp;cm thick, tapering slightly to apex, is whitish, sometimes discoloring a little brownish; finely hairy to shaggy; with a white, skirtlike ring that may discolor brownish; with a slightly enlarged but not bulbous base that is set in a sack-like, flaring or lobed, white volva.<ref name=\"MushroomExpert\"/>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{CCBYSASource|sourcepath=http://www.amanitaceae.org/index.php?Amanita%20basii|sourcearticle=Amanita spreta|revision=740502386|authors(s)=Rodham E.

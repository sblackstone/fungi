The fungus was originally described in 1976 as a species of ''[[Armillaria]]'' when that genus was more inclusive; it received its current name twenty years later. The stout [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) have moist white to grayish [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] (later becoming grayish-brown with age), a membranous [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and an odor resembling cucumbers. [[Mycorrhiza]]l with [[conifer]]s, the fungus fruits in the spring or early summer, with its mushrooms appearing on the ground singly or in groups at high elevations, often at the edge of melting snowbanks. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown, but it has a strong unpleasant odor and a [[wikt:mealy|mealy]] taste.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThe species was originally [[species description|described]] from [[California]] as ''Armillaria olida'' by mycologists [[Harry D. Thiers]] and [[Walter Sundberg]] in 1976. The [[type (biology)|type]] specimen was collected on May 6, 1972, in the Crystal Basin Recreation Area in [[El Dorado County]]. Thiers and Sundberg [[classification (biology)|classified]] it in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Ponderosa'' of genus ''Armillaria'' due to its [[inamyloid]] spores, but noted that its relationship to other species was unclear. They also noted the similarity of the form and color of its cap to species in section ''Constricta'' of genus ''[[Lyophyllum]]''.<ref name=\"Thiers 1976\"/>\n\nThiers and Sundberg used a broad [[species concept]] of ''Armillaria'', including species with a white [[spore print]], [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] attached to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] formed from a [[partial veil]], regardless of their ecological preferences. Today, ''Armillaria'' is restricted to [[wood-rotting fungus|wood-rotting]] species that form black [[rhizomorph]]s, and several [[mycorrhiza]]l former ''Armillaria'' have since been transferred to ''[[Tricholoma]]''. The name ''[[Tricholoma olida]]'' was unavailable for this species, because it was previously used in 1920 by [[Josef Velenovsk\u00fd]],<ref name=\"Velenovsk\u00fd 1920\"/> so Kris Shanks proposed the new name ''T.&nbsp;vernaticum''. The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] refers to its growth in the spring.<ref name=\"Shanks 1996\"/> The previous epithet ''olida'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''olidum'', meaning \"stinking\" or \"smelling\".<ref name=\"Gledhill 2008\"/>\n\n''Tricholoma vernaticum'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[subgenus]] ''Contextocutis'' of the genus ''Tricholoma'' on account of its [[clamp connection]]s and interwoven [[hypha]]e in the [[cap cuticle]].<ref name=\"Shanks 1996\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Tricholoma vernaticum 42750.jpg|thumb|left|The whitish gills are thick and closely spaced, sometimes developing pale pink tints.]]\nThe cap is convex to broadly convex before flattening out in age, and reaches diameters between {{convert|5|and|17|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The surface is dry to moist, smooth, and in maturity appears to be made of flattened fibers arranged radially. As the mushroom ages, the cap color changes from white to fuscous (dusky brownish grey) or brown, usually with olive, grayish or pale tan regions. The cap margin, initially curved downward, lifts up and becomes lobed or irregular with age. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick and white, with a strongly [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] odor similar to cucumber or watermelon rind. [[Lamella (mycology)|Gills]] initially have an emarginate (notched) to [[adnation|adnate]] attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], but pull away as the mushroom matures to become seceding or almost free from attachment. They are thick and closely spaced, and whitish in color, sometimes developing pale pink tints. The solid stipe measures {{convert|4|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1.3|\u2013|3.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and is either equal in width through its length or slightly club-shaped. It has a dry surface, and a texture that is smooth to silky fibrillose above the [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], and appressed fibrillose to scaly below the ring. The ring, located in the middle to upper half of the stem, is sometimes inconspicuous. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown with certainty,<ref name=\"Bessette 2013\"/> although it has been noted to have a strongly farinaceous taste, and an unpleasant odor \"strongly reminiscent of rotting white potatoes.\"<ref name=\"Thiers 1976\"/>\n[[File:Tricholoma vernaticum 145713.jpg|thumb|right|Spores are roughly elliptical.]]\nThe [[spore print]] is white. [[Basidiospore|Spores]] are elliptic (or narrowly so), and measure 8\u201312 by 4.8\u20136.2&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. There are [[clamp connection]]s present in the [[hypha]]e.<ref name=\"Bessette 2013\"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 23\u201330 by 8\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[hymenium]] lacks [[cystidia]]. The cap flesh comprises homogenous, interwoven hyphae that are 3\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, while the [[cap cuticle]] is a 200\u2013300-micrometer thick layer of interwoven, gelatinous hyphae up to 4&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter.<ref name=\"Thiers 1976\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nWhen collected in its typical habitat and during the appropriate season, ''Tricholoma vernaticum'' mushrooms can be readily identified because of their prominent characteristics: white color, stocky fruit body, farinaceous odor, and ring on the stipe. ''Tricholoma'' lookalikes in the same geographic region grow at lower elevations, typically in autumn. ''[[Tricholoma portentosum|T.&nbsp;portentosum]]'' has a gray cap, a stipe with yellow tints, and lacks a ring, while ''[[Tricholoma mutabile|T.&nbsp;mutabile]]'' has violet tones in its cap and also lacks a ring. Other lookalikes include ''[[Hygrophorus subalpinus]]'' and ''[[Hygrophorus camarophyllus|H.&nbsp;camarophyllus]]'', but these species have broad, waxy gills, and lack the characteristic odor of ''T.&nbsp;vernaticum''.<ref name=\"Bessette 2013\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\nFruit bodies of ''Tricholoma vernaticum'' grow singly or in groups under [[conifer]]s in late spring and early summer. A fairly common species throughout its range, it is found at high elevations in California north to [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref name=\"Bessette 2013\"/> It is a [[snowbank fungus]], meaning it is commonly found at the edge of melting snowbanks.<ref name=\"Davis 2012\"/> Fruit bodies are often buried under [[humus]],<ref name=\"Thiers 1976\"/> forming hardly visible \"mushrumps\", apparent only as cracked bumps on the ground.<ref name=\"Bessette 2013\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of North American Tricholoma|List of North American ''Tricholoma'']]\n*[[List of Tricholoma species|List of'' Tricholoma'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bessette 2013\">{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette AE, Bessette AR, Trudell SA, Roody WC |title=Tricholomas of North America: A Mushroom Field Guide |year=2013 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |pages=170\u20131}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Davis 2012\">{{cite book |vauthors=Davis RM, Sommer R, Menge JA |title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America |year=2012|publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0-520-95360-4 |page=169 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=961gjLm2o9EC&pg=PA169}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gledhill 2008\">{{cite book |author=Gledhill D. |title=The Names of Plants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ6PyhVuecwC&pg=PA279 |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0-521-86645-3 |page=279}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Shanks 1996\">{{cite journal |author=Shanks KM. |title=New species of ''Tricholoma'' from California and Oregon |journal=Mycologia |year=1996 |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=497\u2013508 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0088/003/0497.htm |doi=10.2307/3760890}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Thiers 1976\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Thiers HD, Sundberg WJ |title=''Armillaria'' (Tricholomataceae, Agaricales) in the Western United States including a new species from California |journal=Madro\u00f1o |year=1976 |volume=23 |pages=448\u201353 |jstor=41413984}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Velenovsk\u00fd 1920\">{{cite book |author=Velenovsk\u00fd J. |title=\u010cesk\u00e9 houby |year=1920 |volume=2 |location=Prague |publisher=\u010cesk\u00e9 Botanick\u00e9 Spole\u010dnosti |page=241 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/2970785}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Tricholoma vernaticum\">{{cite web |title=''Tricholoma vernaticum'' Shanks, Mycologia, 88 (3): 508, 1996 |url=http://www.mycobank.org/BioloMICS.aspx?Table=Mycobank&Rec=178683&Fields=All |publisher=[[MycoBank]].

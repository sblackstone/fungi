The mushrooms produced by the fungus are relatively large for the genus ''[[Mycena]]'', with convex grayish [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|15|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are whitish to pale gray, and initially closely spaced before becoming well-spaced at maturity after the cap enlarges. The mushrooms are characterized by the dense covering of white \"hairs\" on the base of the stem. ''M.&nbsp;overholtsii'' is an example of a [[snowbank fungus]], growing on well-decayed [[conifer]] logs near snowbanks, during or just after [[snowmelt]]. Formerly known only from high-elevation areas of western North America, particularly the [[Rocky Mountain]] and [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] regions, it was reported for the first time in Japan in 2010. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown. ''M.&nbsp;overholtsii'' can be distinguished from other comparable species by differences in location, or [[spore]] size.\n\n==History and naming==\nThe species was first described by mycologists [[Alexander H. Smith]] and [[Wilhelm Solheim (botanist)|Wilhelm Solheim]] in 1953, on the basis of specimens collected in the [[Medicine Bow Mountains]] of [[Albany County, Wyoming]].<ref name=Smith1953/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] honors the early 20th-century American mycologist [[Lee Oras Overholts]].<ref name=Evenson1997/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"snowbank fairy helmet\",<ref name=McKnight1987/> or \"fuzzy foot\",<ref name=Cripps2009/> although it shares the latter name with ''[[Tapinella atrotomentosa]]''<ref name=Russell2006/> and ''[[Xeromphalina campanella]]''.<ref name=Bessette2007/> ''M.&nbsp;overholtsii'' has been given the Japanese name ''yukitsutsumikunugitake''.<ref name=Cha2010/>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Mycena overholtsii 10836.jpg\n| caption1 = View of the gills and tomentose stem\n| width = 200\n| image2 = Mycena overholtsii 10830.jpg\n| caption2 = The cap of this mature specimen has a broad umbo, and radial striations on the margin.\n}}\n''Mycena overholtsii'' produces some of the largest mushrooms of the genus ''[[Mycena]]''.<ref name=\"urlUSDeptInterior\"/> They have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are {{convert|1.5|to|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, and convex in shape, developing an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] (a central protrusion resembling a nipple) in maturity. The cap surface is smooth, moist, and marked with radial striations.<ref name=Miller2006/> The caps are somewhat [[hygrophanous]], and depending on age and state of hydration, range in color from brown or grayish-brown,<ref name=Orr1979/> to dark or bluish-gray. The mushroom [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and watery, with a light gray color.<ref name=Evenson1997/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an [[adnation|adnate]], [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]], or shallowly [[decurrent]] attachment to the stem, and are initially closely spaced before becoming well-spaced at maturity.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena overholtzii\"/> They have a whitish to pale gray color, and will stain gray when they are bruised.<ref name=Phillips2005/> There are three or four tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem) interspersed between the gills.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena overholtzii\"/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4|to|15|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.3|to|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and tapers upward so that the stem apex is slightly thinner than the base.<ref name=Miller2006/> It can be straight or curved, has cartilage-like flesh, and is hollow in maturity.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena overholtzii\"/> When growing on soft, well-decayed wood, the stem often penetrates deeply into the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]].<ref name=McKnight1987/> The stem is pinkish-brown in color, and the lower half is tomentose \u2013 densely covered with white, woolly hairs.<ref name=Orr1979/> The mushroom has a yeast-like odor and a mild taste;<ref name=PNRS1999/> its [[edible mushroom|edibility]] is unknown,<ref name=Orr1979/> but it is not considered [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]].<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n\nViewed in deposit, as with a [[spore print]], the [[spore]]s appear white. Microscopically, the spores are roughly elliptical, sometimes appearing bean-shaped, with dimensions of 5.5\u20137.0 by 3.0\u20133.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. They are thin-walled and smooth, and bear an indistinct [[hilum (biology)|hilar appendage]].<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena overholtzii\"/> The spores are [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning they will absorb [[iodine]] and turn black to blue-black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge), which are scattered and interspersed with basidia, are roughly cylindric to fusoid (spindle-shaped), smooth, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and  measure 45\u201365 by 2\u20135.5&nbsp;\u03bcm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are uncommon, and similar in appearance to the cheilocystidia. The [[Pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is an ixocutis (a fungal tissue type in which the [[hypha]]e are gelatinous and lie flat) with mostly smooth hyphae that are 1.5\u20133.5&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. The cap flesh is dextrinoid, meaning it will turn reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of ''M.&nbsp;overholtsii''.<ref name=PNRS1999/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| image1 = Mycena spec. - Lindsey 14a.jpg\n| caption1 = ''M. maculata''\n| width1 = {{#expr: (120 * 640 / 426) round 0}}\n| image2 = Mycena galericulata 60303.jpg\n| caption2 = ''M. galericulata''\n| width2 = {{#expr: (120 * 2448 / 3264) round 0}}\n}}\nOther similar mycenas that grow in clusters on wood include ''[[Mycena maculata|M.&nbsp;maculata]]'' and ''[[Mycena galericulata|M.&nbsp;galericulata]]''. The fruit bodies of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' often develop red stains as they mature, but this characteristic is inconsistent and cannot be reliably used for identification. Its spores are larger than that of ''M.&nbsp;overholtsii'', measuring 7\u201310 by 4\u20136&nbsp;\u03bcm. ''M.&nbsp;galericulata'' is very similar in appearance to ''M.&nbsp;maculata'', but does not undergo reddish staining; its spores are 8\u201312 by 5.5\u20139&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Ammirati2009/> Another similar species is ''[[Mycena semivestipes|M.&nbsp;semivestipes]]'',<ref name=Geesteranus1992/> which can be distinguished by its [[bleach]]-like odor, an eastern North American distribution, fruiting season during summer and autumn, and small spores measuring 4\u20135 by 2.5\u20133&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=\"urlKuo:Mycena semivestipes\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\nThis species is sometimes found singly, but more often in clusters on well-rotted [[conifer]] logs and stumps (often [[Douglas-fir]]) near melting snowbanks,<ref name=McKnight1987/> or sometimes in moist snow chambers formed by receding snow.<ref name=Phillips2005/> Cool nighttime temperatures reduce the snowmelt rate, and help ensure that spores released by the mushroom will be dispersed into the soil.<ref name=Miller2006/> The mushroom is common in western North America, particularly the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Cascade Range|Cascade mountains]]. It has been reported in four US states: [[South Dakota]],<ref name=Gabel2007/> [[California]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], but is not known in [[Oregon]].<ref name=PNRS1999/> It is also found in western Canada.<ref name=Farr1989/> The mushroom is restricted to areas with minimum elevations of {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"urlUSDeptInterior\"/> In 2010, it was reported growing in the [[boreal forest|boreal]] coniferous forests of [[Hokkaido]], Japan, in plantations of [[Sakhalin fir]] (''Abies sachalinensis''), as well as in natural forests dominated by both Sakhalin fir and [[Jezo spruce]] (''Picea jezoensis'').<ref name=Cha2010/> In North America, the mushroom usually appears between March and July;<ref name=PNRS1999/> Japanese collections were made in May.<ref name=Cha2010/> The fruiting period can be prolonged, especially in areas with heavy snowfall,<ref name=Smith1980/> or at high elevations where the snowmelt is delayed.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Ammirati2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati J, Trudell S |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest |series=Timber Press Field Guides |publisher=[[Timber Press]] |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2009 |page=129 |isbn=0-88192-935-2}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette2007>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms of the Southeastern United States  |vauthors=Bessette AE, Roody WC, Bessette AR |year=2007 |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |location=Syracuse, New York |isbn=978-0-8156-3112-5 |page=201 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IB1Gv3jZMmAC&pg=PA201}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Cha2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cha JY, Lee SY, Chun KW, Lee SY, Ohga S |title=A new record of a snowbank fungus, ''Mycena overholtsii'', from Japan |journal=\u4e5d\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u8fb2\u5b66\u90e8\u7d00\u8981 (Journal of the Faculty of Agriculture Kyushu University) |year=2010 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=77\u201378 |issn=0023-6152 |url=https://qir.kyushu-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2324/17804/1/55_1_p77.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Cripps2009>{{cite journal |author=Cripps C. |title=Snowbank fungi revisited |journal=Fungi |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2009 |pages=47\u201353 |url=http://www.fungimag.com/spring-09-articles/13_Snow.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Evenson1997>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms of Colorado and the Southern Rocky Mountains |last=Evenson VS. |year=1997 |publisher=Westcliffe Publishers |location=Denver, Colorado |isbn=978-1-56579-192-3 |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAeDeyqZLq0C&pg=PA101}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Farr1989>{{cite book |vauthors=Farr DF, Bills GF, Chamuris GP, Rossman AY |title=Fungi on plants and plant products in the United States |publisher=[[American Phytopathological Society|APS Press]] |year=1989 |location=St. Paul, Minnesota |isbn=978-0-89054-099-2}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Gabel2007>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gabel AC, Gabel ML |title=Comparison of diversity of macrofungi and vascular plants at seven sites in the Black Hills of South Dakota |journal=American Midland Naturalist |year=2007 |volume=157 |issue=2 |pages=258\u201396 |jstor=4500617 |doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2007)157[258:codoma]2.0.co;2}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Geesteranus1992>{{cite journal |author=Maas Geesteranus RS. |title=Mycenas of the Northern Hemisphere |journal=Verhandelingen der Koninklijke Nederlandsche Akademie van Wetenschappen, Afdeeling Natuurkunde |year=1992 |volume=90 |issue=2 |page=284}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=McKnight1987>{{cite book |vauthors=McKnight VB, McKnight KH |title=A Field Guide to Mushrooms, North America |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] |location=Boston, Massachusetts |year=1987 |page=175 |isbn=0-395-91090-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSdA3V7Z9WcC&pg=PA175}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Miller2006>{{cite book |vauthors=Miller HR, Miller OK |title=North American Mushrooms: a Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi |publisher=Falcon Guide |location=Guilford, Connecticut |year=2006 |page=168 |isbn=0-7627-3109-5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Orr1979>{{cite book |vauthors=Orr DB, Orr RT |title=Mushrooms of Western North America |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley, California |year=1979 |page=238 |isbn=0-520-03656-5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Phillips2005>{{cite book |author=Phillips R. |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, New York |year=2005 |page=95 |isbn=1-55407-115-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=PNRS1999>{{cite report |vauthors=Castellano MA, Smith JE, O'Dell T, C\u00e1zares E, Nugent S |title=Handbook to Strategy 1 Fungal Species in the Northwest Forest Plan.

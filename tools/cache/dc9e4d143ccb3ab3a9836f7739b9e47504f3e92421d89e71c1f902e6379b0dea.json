The fruiting bodies, appearing in late summer or fall, commonly incorporate blades of grass, twigs, or fallen pine needles as they grow.  As these fruiting bodies age, the pore surface turns from yellow to greenish yellow, the top becomes darker, and the flesh becomes harder and more wood-like.<ref name=volk/>\n\nThe effect, impact and significance of infection by this fungus is rooted in the fact that it causes brown rot, which degrades the cellulose.  Thus there is a loss of tensile strength which often leads to brittle fracture near the stem base, even at a fairly early stage of decay.  Decay initiated above ground can lead to branch snap or breakout.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watson |first1=Guy |last2=Green |first2=Ted|title=Fungi on Trees|date=2011|publisher=The Arboricultural Association|location=Gloucestershire, England|isbn=978-0-900978-55-5|page=46}}</ref>\n\n''P. schweinitzii'' is native to [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]],<ref name=fidl>{{cite journal| title=Schweinitzii Root and Butt Rot of Western Conifers| first=Susan K. | last=Hagle| first2=Gregory M.| last2=Filip| journal=Forest Insect & Disease Leaflet |issue=177 |date=March 2010 |publisher=USDA Forest Service | url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/nr/fid/fidls/fidl-177.pdf| format=pdf}}</ref> and has been identified as an exotic species in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], and [[South Africa]].<ref name=scion>{{cite journal| title=Exotic Wood Decay Fungus on Pine |journal=Forest Health News| issue=126 |date=February 2003 |publisher=Scion |url=http://www.nzffa.org.nz/images/design/diseases/Phaeolus-schweinitzii/Phaeolus-schweinitziiFHnews126.html}}</ref>\n\nAs its common name suggests, the dyer's polypore is an excellent natural source of green, yellow, gold, or brown [[natural dye|dye]], depending on the material dyed and the [[mordant]] used.<ref name=volk>{{cite web| url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/nov2007.html |title=''Phaeolus schweinitzii'', the dye polypore or velvet-top fungus |first=Tom |last=Volk | first2=Debby| last2=Hanmer| work=Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month |date=November 2007 |accessdate=2011-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://mushroom-collecting.com/mushroomdyeing.html | publisher=Mushroom-Collecting.com | title=Dyeing with Mushrooms | accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref>\n\n''P. schweinitzii'' is named after [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]], a [[Pennsylvania]]-born [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] minister and important early [[United States|American]] [[mycology|mycologist]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1314913}}\n\n[[Category:Brown rot fungus]]\n[[Category:Fungal tree pathogens and diseases]]\n[[Category:Fomitopsidaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Natural dyes]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1821]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Elias Magnus Fries]]"}]}}}}

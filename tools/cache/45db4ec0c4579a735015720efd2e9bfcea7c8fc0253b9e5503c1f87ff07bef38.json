It is a large, white-colored fungus, often  tinged with cream. Native to [[Europe]], it is found on plains as well as mountains in the [[Mediterranean]] region. The species was first described in 1833 by [[Pierre Bulliard]], a French physician and botanist, and [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]], a French mycologist and naturalist.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Amanita ovoidea 1.JPG|thumb|left|150px|''A. ovoidea'' mushroom in a forest.]]\nThe mushroom is white to cream-coloured and can reach very large sizes, over 15&nbsp;cm, or in exceptional cases over 30&nbsp;cm. The [[cap (mycology)|cap]] is smooth, fleshy, silky, hemispherical when young, but soon becoming convex to shield shaped. The cap margin is usually covered with hanging, cottony remains of the [[partial veil]]. The [[lamella (mycology)|lamella]]e are thick, rounded, broad and are free from the stipe. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is thick, cylindrical, powdery, has a fragile, cottony ring, and a large, white to ochraceous-cream [[volva (mycology)|volva]] at the base. The flesh is thick, white and has a strong, unpleasant smell. The [[spore print]] is white, and the elliptical [[basidiospore|spores]] measure 10\u201312 \u00d7 6.5\u20138 [[\u03bcm]].<ref>Galli R. 2007. Le Amanite 2nd Edition. Edinatura.</ref><ref>Neville P, Poumarat S. 2004. Fungi Europaei 9: Amanitae. Edizioni Candusso, Italia.</ref>\n\n''[[Amanita proxima]]'', a poisonous species containing [[allenic norleucine]], is very similar to ''A. ovoidea''. It is separated by the deep ochraceous to russet-orange colour of its volva, the persistent pendulous ring on the stipe, and the smooth cap margin, without vellar remains. ''A. proxima'' is found in the same habitats as ''A. ovoidea'', and can cause cytolytic [[hepatitis]] and [[acute renal failure]].<ref>Ducros J, Labastie J and Saingra S. (1995).

In the past, the fungus has been reported as \"edible\" in some books and \"poisonous\" in others. Moreover, it can easily be confused with other all-white, deadly poisonous ''Amanita'' species, such as ''[[Amanita virosa]]'', ''[[Amanita verna]]'' and, in particular, ''[[Amanita proxima]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.fungipedia.es/clasificacion-orden/basidiomycetes/65-agaricales/162-amanita-ovoidea.html&prev=/search%3Fq%3DAmanita%2Bovoidea%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26sa%3DN%26prmd%3Di&rurl=translate.google.com&twu=1&usg=ALkJrhgdO_UQP2djVC8YYii8dM_5mn-3OQ | title = Amanita ovoid | accessdate = 2010-05-24 | last = P\u00e9rez Calvo200 | first = Javi | date = 2009-01-23 | work = Fungipedia}}</ref> In southern [[France]], some people were inflicted with [[acute kidney injury]] because they accidentally consumed ''A. proxima'', mistaking it for ''A. ovoidea''.<ref>de Haro L, Jouglard J, Arditti J, David JM.

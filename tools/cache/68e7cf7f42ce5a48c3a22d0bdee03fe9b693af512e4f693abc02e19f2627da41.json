Distributed in eastern North America, it has a medium-sized, bell-shaped to flattened [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, with felt-like, patchy scales. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], initially white, turn black in maturity and eventually dissolve into a black \"ink\". [[Basidiocarp|Fruit bodies]] grow in clusters or groups on leaf litter or rotted [[hardwood]], although the wood may be buried, giving the appearance of growing in the soil. The fungus is found in the United States, in areas east of the [[Great Plains]]. ''Coprinus ebulbosus'' and ''Coprinus quadrifidus'' are names assigned by [[Charles Horton Peck]] to what he believed were species distinct from ''C.&nbsp;variegata''; they were later shown to represent the same species, and are now  [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]]. The mushroom is not recommended for consumption, and has been shown to cause [[allergy|allergic]] reactions in susceptible individuals.\n\n==History and taxonomy==\n[[File:Charles Horton Peck.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Peck described three species now considered synonymous with ''Coprinopsis variegata''.]]\nAmerican mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] described three similar species over the course of a 24-year time period. The first, ''Coprinus variegata'' (1873),<ref name=Peck1873/> followed later by ''C.&nbsp;ebulbosus'' (1895),<ref name=Peck1895/> and finally ''C.&nbsp;quadrifidus'' (1897).<ref name=Peck1897/> ''C.&nbsp;ebulbosus''  was initially considered a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of the European species ''Coprinus picaceus'' (Bull. ex Fr.) S.F.Gray (currently known as ''[[Coprinopsis picacea]]''<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Coprinopsis picacea\"/>). Four years later, Peck published a more complete description of var. ''ebulbosus'' and raised it to species rank, having found it to differ consistently from ''C.&nbsp;picaceus'' in its smaller stature, lack of a bulbous stem base, and much smaller [[spore]]s.<ref name=Peck1895/>\n\nThe three species described by Peck were distinguished on the basis of physical features that were later found to be somewhat overlapping. In terms of microscopic characters, spore sizes were not sufficiently different between them to be used as discriminating taxonomic characters. Subsequent investigators of North American mushroom flora had difficulties in interpreting Peck's concepts of these three [[taxon|taxa]] and in confirming their presence in their regional investigations. For example, [[Charles McIlvaine (mycologist)|McIlvaine]] (1902),<ref name=McIlvaine1902/> [[Miron Elisha Hard|Hard]] (1908),<ref name=Hard1908/> and [[Walter Byron McDougall|McDougall]] (1925)<ref name=McDougall1925/> reported (as variety or species) only ''C.&nbsp;ebulbosus''. [[Guy Richard Bisby|Bisby]] (1938),<ref name=Bisby1938/> Christensen (1946),<ref name=Christensen1946/> [[Alexander H. Smith|Smith]] (1958),<ref name=Smith1980/> and [[James Walton Groves|Groves]] (1962)<ref name=Groves1962/> mentioned only ''C.&nbsp;quadrifidus''. Both [[Calvin Henry Kauffman|Kauffman]] (1918) and Graham (1944)<ref name=Graham1944/> described ''C.&nbsp;ebulbosus'' and ''C.&nbsp;quadrifidus'';<ref name=Kauffman1918/> Graham, however, only included ''C.&nbsp;quadrifidus'' in his [[identification key|key]] to his descriptions of ''Coprinus'' species. In 1979, W.&nbsp;Patrick published a comparative analysis of the three taxa from material collected by Peck, and, after concluding that the three were not sufficiently distinct to be considered separate species, reduced them to [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] with ''Coprinopsis variegata'', the earliest name.<ref name=Patrick1979/>\n\nThe [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''variegata'' derives from the [[Latin]] passive verb participle ''variegatus'' meaning \"to have different colors, to variegate\".<ref name=Brooker2006/>  The synonym name ''quadrifidus'' refers to the four segments into which the cap frequently split when mature,<ref name=Peck1897/> while ''ebulbosus'' means \"not being bulbous\". The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"scaly ink cap\"<ref name=Roody2003/> or the \"feltscale inky cap\".<ref name=McKnight1987/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Coprinopsis variegata 47808.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Young fruit bodies are oval or egg-shaped.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''C.&nbsp;variegata'' is thin, initially oval-shaped then bell-shaped, and then flattened with the margin turned upward; it reaches diameters of up to {{convert|12|in|cm|1|abbr=on}}. When young, the surface of the cap is covered with a woolly whitish or yellowish veil that breaks up into short-lived flakes or scales; this process reveals the radially striate (grooved) gray to grayish-brown cap surface. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are broad, thin, crowded closely together, and free from attachment to the stem. They are initially white but turn to dark purplish-brown as the spores mature. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4|to|12|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} and up to {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, hollow, and whitish.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> It is roughly the same width throughout the length of the stem, and may have a wispy, cotton-like [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] present near the base.<ref name=Patrick1979/> Clusters of fruit bodies have a mass of [[rhizomorph]]s at the base called an ''ozonium''.<ref name=Smith1980/>\n\nIn [[spore print|deposit]], the [[spore]]s are dark brown.<ref name=Smith1980/> A [[light microscope]] may be used to reveal more features of the spores, including smooth surfaces, a dark brown color, an [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] shape in face view and an egg shape in side view, and dimensions of 7.5\u20139.5 by 4\u20134.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The apex of the spore appears [[wikt:truncate|truncated]] because of the presence of a [[germ pore]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are [[hyaline]] (translucent), with dimensions of 14\u201316 by 6.5\u20137.5&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[paraphyses]] are 9\u201311 by 8\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m, hyaline, and collapse readily. The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] present on the gill face) are abundant, roughly cylindrical, hyaline, and measure 100\u2013150 by 20\u201335&nbsp;\u00b5m. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of an gill) are present in young specimens, and are roughly ellipsoid, measuring 50\u201380 by 15\u201325&nbsp;\u00b5m.  [[Clamp connection]]s are abundant in the [[hypha]]e in all tissues through the fruit body.<ref name=Smith1948/>\n\nThe [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of ''Coprinopsis variegata'' has not been clearly established, and opinions differ as to its desirability. One 1987 [[field guide]] to North American species warns against consumption, calling it \"not recommended\",<ref name=McKnight1987/> a conclusion shared in a 2006 field guide to [[Pennsylvania]]n and [[Mid-Atlantic States|mid-Atlantic]] mushrooms, but not before describing it as \"the best of the inky caps, with a richer flavor and better texture than the famous shaggy mane\".<ref name=Russell2006/> The bitter-tasting mushroom is not considered poisonous.<ref name=Smith1980/> However, the fruit bodies are suspected to contain the [[Antabuse]]-like chemical [[coprine]], which causes a poisoning reaction when consumed with alcohol.<ref name=Hatfield1978/><ref name=Ammirati1985/> Additionally, cases of [[allergy|allergic]] reactions against extracts from mushroom tissues have been reported in skin tests.<ref name=Davis1988/><ref name=ONeil1990/><ref name=Lehrer1994/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Coprinopsis.atramentaria.-.lindsey.jpg|thumb|right|''Coprinopsis atramentaria'']]\n''[[Coprinopsis atramentaria]]'' is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] species that is roughly similar in size, color, and stature, but does not have patchy woolly tufts on the cap like ''C.&nbsp;variegata''.<ref name=Healy2008/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\nThe species is [[saprobic]]\u2014deriving nutrients by decomposing and digesting organic matter\u2014and grows in clusters or in groups on decaying leaf litter or well-decayed wood. It typically fruits in a narrow window from June to July; this spring and early summer fruiting distinguishes it from the more common ''[[Coprinus comatus]]'' and ''[[Coprinopsis atramentaria]]'', which produce fruit bodies in late autumn.<ref name=Patrick1979/> It is found in the United States, in areas east of the [[Great Plains]].<ref name=Smith1980/>\n\n''Coprinopsis variegata'' can attack soil bacteria, such as species of ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and ''[[Agrobacterium]]'', and use them as nutrient sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized [[hypha]]e in the direction of the bacteria, sensing them with some [[chemotaxis|chemoattractive]] mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.<ref name=Barron1988/><ref name=Trevors2007/>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Coprinopsis

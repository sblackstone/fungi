While especially associated with birch, it is also found with spruce, pine and other trees in mixed woodland.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe messy, dirty appearance, seen in the photograph, is characteristic of the species and gives it its English name and the Latin species epithet, ''turpis''. It seems to collect debris on top and the gills acquire a dirty brownish stain due to discoloured milk.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThis very variable mushroom demonstrates a common phenomenon in [[mycology]] as there is much disagreement over naming.

At first it has an involute margin and a somewhat depressed centre. The upper surface is olive brown or yellow-green and is often sticky or slimy in the middle. When young it has velvety zones and may be shaggy at the rim. Later it becomes funnel-shaped and the colour darkens to blackish. The gills are dirty white, stained olive-brown by old milk, which is initially white on contact with the air. They are somewhat decurrent. With [[potassium hydroxide]] or [[ammonia]] there is a purple reaction. The stipe is up to about {{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|3|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in diameter and it is similar in colour to the cap, but much lighter. It may have shallow pits (scrobiculae). The flesh is a dirty white and tends to turn brown. The taste (especially the milk) is acrid. There is little smell. The spores are about 7x6&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5]] and are ornamented with a pattern of ridges.\n\n==Edibility==\nThis species is reported to contain the [[mutagen]] necatorin (=7-hydroxycoumaro(5,6-c)cinnoline), and so it cannot be recommended for eating.

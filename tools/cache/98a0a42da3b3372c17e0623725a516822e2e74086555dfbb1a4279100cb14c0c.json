It grows in late July to November in the east and in the winter on the west coast of North America. It has a rusty orange [[spore print]] and a bitter taste.  It contains the [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[prodrug]] [[psilocybin]].<ref name=\"Stamets\"/>\n\n==Systematics==\n\n''Gymnopilus luteofolius'' was first [[species description|described]] as ''Agaricus luteofolius'' by [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1875.  It was renamed ''Pholiota luteofolius'' by [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] in 1887, and was given its current name by mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] in 1951.<ref name=\"Singer\"/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''Gymnopilus luteofolius'' have reddish to purplish to yellow [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s {{convert|2|to|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, which often develop green stains. This cap surface is covered with fasciculate scales that start out purplish, soon fade to brick red, and finally fades to yellow as the mushroom matures.  The context is reddish to light lavender, fading to yellowish as the mushroom matures.  The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have [[adnation|adnate]] attachment and start off yellow, turning rusty brown as the spores mature.  The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is the same color as the cap, often dusted with rusty brown spores, fibrillose, measuring 3\u20139 by 3\u201310&nbsp;mm thick, equal to enlarged near the base.  The stipe often has greenish stains near the base.  The taste is bitter.<ref name=\"Hesler\"/> \n[[File:Gymnopilus luteofolius spores.jpg|thumb|right|''Gymnopilus luteofolius'' spores]]\nThe spores are bright rusty brown [[spore print|in deposit]], measuring (5.5) 6\u20138.5 x (3.5) 4\u20134.5 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]], ellipsoid to subellipsoid, inequilateral, roughened and [[dextrinoid]], with no germ pore.  The [[basidium|basidia]] measure 24\u201328 x 6\u20137 \u03bcm and are 4-spored.  The basidioles are often brown.   The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) measures 30\u201338 x 5\u201310 \u03bcm, hyaline, fusoid to subventricose.  The cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) measures 23\u201328 x 4\u20137 \u03bcm, ventricose to flash shaped, often [[capitate]].  The lamellar [[Trama (mycology)|trama]] is made up of parallel hyphae 5\u201318 \u03bcm across, frequently [[septate]], with yellowish [[biological pigment|pigment]] that is dissolved by potassium hydroxide.  The pileus trama is interwoven, and the [[cap cuticle|pileus cuticle]] has brown tufts of brown incrusted hyphae.  The pileocystidia measure 44\u201353 (100) \u03bcm, and are club-shaped, [[cylindrical]] or [[ventricose]] terminal elements on the hyphae that forms the scales on the cap.  [[Cystidia]] on the stipe (caulocystidia) are 20\u201363 x 3\u201315 \u03bcm, club shaped, [[ventricose]] or flask shaped.  The gill trama and pileus trama are pale yellowish-brown in [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]] and reddish brown in [[Melzer's reagent]].  [[Clamp connections]] are present.<ref name=\"Hesler\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Gymnopilus species|List of ''Gymnopilus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Singer\">{{cite book |author=Singer R. |year=1951 |title=The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy |series=Lilloa |volume=22 |issue= |page=560}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Stamets\">{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Stamets | year=1996 | title=Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World | publisher=Ten Speed Press | location=Berkeley | isbn=0-9610798-0-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hesler\">{{cite book | first=L.

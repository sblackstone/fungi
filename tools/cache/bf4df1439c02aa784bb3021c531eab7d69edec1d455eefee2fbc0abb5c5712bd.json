It was formerly known as ''Hygrocybe psittacina'', but a [[molecular phylogenetics]] study found it to belong in the genus ''[[Gliophorus]]''. It had already been placed in ''Gliophorus'', but it had been considered a synonym of ''[[Hygrocybe]]''.<ref name=Babos/>\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 306 hygrocybe psittacina.jpg|thumb|left|''G. psittacinus'' on [[Faroe Islands]] stamp]]\n\nThe Parrot Toadstool is a small mushroom, with a convex to [[umbonate]] [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] 1\u20133 centimetres (\u2153\u20131 in)  in diameter, which is green when young and later yellowish or even pinkish tinged. The 2\u20134&nbsp;cm  [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is green to greenish yellow. The broad adnate [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are greenish with yellow edges and spore print white. The green colouring persists at the stem apex even in old specimens.\n\nIts odour and taste are not distinctive.  There are no known chemical tests.\n\nIt fruits late summer to autumn (September to November)<ref name=Paul/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Gliophorus psittacinus'' is widely distributed in grasslands in [[Western Europe]], [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], the Americas, South Africa and Japan, being found in late summer and autumn. In Europe it is apparently in decline due to the degradation of habitats. Early Australian records of this form have been found to be the similar green toadstools ''[[Gliophorus graminicolor]]'' or ''[[Gliophorus viridis|G.&nbsp;viridis]]'' on reexamination. Gliophorus psitacinus is known to occur at one site in the [[Lane Cove River]] valley near [[Sydney]].<ref>D.W. Noble, Fungi of the Sydney Region Facebook Group - July 2019</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nDespite its small size and being coated in a sticky substance, ''Gliophorus psittacinus'' is often listed as edible in mushroom guides, inedible in others. Consumption of over 20 specimens in one sitting, however, can cause [[gastrointestinal disorders]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Babos>Babos et al. 2011.

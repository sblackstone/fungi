The mushrooms produced by the fungus have convex to flattened drab [[lilac (color)|lilac]]-colored [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are up to {{convert|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The cream-colored [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are closely spaced together and extend slightly down the length of the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], which is up to {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|3.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. The mushroom produces an off-white [[latex]] when injured that stains the mushroom tissue brownish.\n\nThe species is found in eastern North America, with a range extending from Canada to northeastern Mexico. It has also been found in pine plantations in Brazil, where it is probably an [[introduced species]].  ''[[Lactarius trivialis]]'' is a European counterpart that is similar in appearance. In addition to its distribution, it can be distinguished from ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' by differences in preferred habitat and color differences in the gills, cap, and latex. The ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' [[variety (biology)|variety]] ''megacarpus'', a larger form with caps up to {{convert|27|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, occurs under [[coast live oak]] and [[tanoak]] in the [[Pacific Coast]] states and [[Baja California]]. Variety ''dissimilis'', described on the basis of a single specimen from [[South Carolina]], differs from the main form in the microscopic structure of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]].\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\nThe species was first described by American mycologists [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]] in their 1979 [[monograph]] on the North American species of ''Lactarius''.<ref name=Hesler1979/> The [[type specimen]]\u2014collected by Smith from [[Oak Grove, Livingston County, Michigan]], in July 1972\u2014is housed at the [[University of Michigan Herbarium]].<ref name=\"urlUofMichHerb\"/> Hesler and Smith simultaneously published the [[variety (botany)|varieties]] ''dissimilis'' and ''megacarpus'', collected from [[South Carolina]] and [[California]], respectively.<ref name=Hesler1979/> The variety ''megacarpus'' is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"vulgar milkcap\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\nSmith and Hesler classified ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' in [[subgenus]] ''Tristes'', in stirps ''Argillaceifolius''. This grouping of related species, which includes ''[[Lactarius fumaecolor|L.&nbsp;fumaecolor]]'', is characterized by the gelatinous cuticle of the stem.<ref>Hesler and Smith (1979, [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/f/fung1tc/aac3719.0001.001/376?page=root;rgn=mainheader;sid=c9eed00f57eb4cae87faf520e74fdb71;size=100;view=image;rgn1=citation;q1=aac3719 p.&nbsp;364]).</ref>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Lactarius argillaceifolius var. megacarpus 65964.jpg\n| caption1 = Detail of var.

''megacarpus'' shown).\n}}\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|4|\u2013|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, and initially convex to broadly convex before flattening out with a depressed center. The cap margin is curved inward, and often remains that way into maturity. The cap surface is covered with fine soft hairs when young, but later becomes smooth; it is slimy and sticky when wet. The color of the cap ranges from [[lilac (color)|lilac]]-brown when young, fading to lilac-[[tan (color)|tan]] or pale lilac-gray and eventually to pale tan or pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]] at the center. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are attached to slightly decurrent (extending somewhat down the length of the stem), broad, and packed together closely. They are [[cream (color)|cream]]-colored when young, and later develop pinkish tones near the margin. In maturity, they become flushed with brownish-orange. The color stains buff to olive-brown to dark brown when bruised.<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|6|\u2013|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1.5|\u2013|3.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and nearly equal in width throughout or tapering downward. Its surface may be slimy or dry, depending on the moisture in the environment. It is whitish, but in age becomes spotted with brownish stains. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm, and white to buff. Its odor is not distinctive, while its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly acrid. The [[latex]] is creamy-white on initial exposure, and stains the gills grayish-brown to dark brown or olive-brown; its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly acrid.<ref name=Bessette2009/> Older fruit bodies tend to have less abundant and weaker-tasting latex.<ref name=Hesler1979/> The [[spore print]] is pinkish-buff. The edibility of ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' is unknown.<ref name=Bessette2009/> The cap surface will turn yellow to orange when a drop of dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] is applied.<ref name=Guevara1987/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n[[File:Lactarius argillaceifolius var. megacarpus spores.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Spore surfaces are ornamented and may form a partial reticulum.]]\nThe [[spore]]s are roughly spherical to broadly elliptical, and measure 7\u201311 by 7\u20138 [[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are ornamented with warts and ridges that sometimes form a partial [[wikt:reticulum|reticulum]] (a pattern of interconnected ridges), with prominences up to 1&nbsp;\u00b5m high. The spore are [[hyaline]] (translucent) and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning that they will absorb [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] of young specimens is made of a tissue type known an ixotrichoderm, which contains gelatinized [[hypha]]e of different lengths arranged in roughly parallel fashion. As the mushroom matures, the cap cuticle gradually becomes an ixolattice\u2014characterized by branching, entangled, gelatinous hyphae.<ref name=Bessette2009/> The [[basidium|basidia]] (the spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, and measure 45\u201352 by 9\u201310.5&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[wikt:pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are abundant, and relatively long\u2014between 60\u2013140&nbsp;\u00b5m long by 6\u201314&nbsp;\u00b5m thick. The [[wikt:cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 32\u201367 by 6\u20139&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Hesler1979/>\n\n===Varieties===\n''Lactarius argillaceifolius'' var. ''dissimilis'', a [[variety (botany)|variety]] reported from [[South Carolina]], is nearly identical in appearance, but it has white latex that tastes bitter then acrid. The structure of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] differs from the nominate variety in that it has dextrinoid (staining yellowish or reddish brown with Meltzer's reagent) incrustations on the hyphae.<ref name=Hesler1979/> The variety ''megacarpus'' has a larger cap (up to {{convert|27|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide with flesh that is up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick), and white and unchanging latex with an acrid taste. Its stem measures {{convert|16|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|4|to|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide near the top.<ref name=Hesler1979/> Microscopically, the spores of var. ''megacarpus'' are more reticulate than the nominate variety.<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Lactarius trivialis 72087.jpg|thumb|right|''Lactarius trivialis'' is a lookalike species.]]\n''[[Lactarius trivialis]]'' is a European species that is similar in appearance to ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'', and they are often confused for each other.<ref name=McKnight1987/> ''L.&nbsp;trivialis'' can be distinguished by gills that stain brown when exposed to the latex, and a preference for growing in conifer- and birch-rich boreal and subalpine forests.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> Variety ''megacarpus'' may be confused with ''[[Lactarius pallescens|L.&nbsp;pallescens]]'', a smaller paler-colored species with latex that stains gills lilac rather than brown.<ref name=\"urlCalifornisFungi\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nLike all ''[[Lactarius]]'' species, ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l. The fruit bodies of ''Lactarius argillaceifolius'' grow scattered or in groups on the ground under hardwoods, especially [[oak]], from July to October. It is often one of the first mycorrhizal mushrooms to fruit in forests dominated by oak and hickory.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> The fruit bodies are slow to develop and are long-lasting.<ref name=Hesler1979/> The species is found from eastern Canada south to [[Florida]], and west to [[Minnesota]] and [[Texas]].<ref name=Bessette2009/> It is common in northeast Mexico.<ref name=Guevara1987/> The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil (state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]) growing in association with pine (''[[Pinus elliottii]]'') plantations, where it has probably been [[introduced species|introduced]] with pine seedlings brought by settlers.<ref name=Giachini2000/> ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' var. ''megacarpus'' has been collected from [[Baja California]],<ref name=Candusso1994/> California, Oregon, and Washington,<ref name=Bessette2009/> where it grows in association with [[coast live oak]] and [[tanoak]].<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=76 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86tM01VsFG0C&pg=PA76}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette AR, Bessette A, Harris DM |title=Milk Mushrooms of North America: A Field Guide to the Genus ''Lactarius'' |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |year=2009 |pages=148\u20139 |isbn=0-8156-3229-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Candusso1994>{{cite journal |vauthors=Candusso M, Gennari A, Ayala N |year=1994 |title=Agaricales of Baja California - Mexico |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=50 |pages=175\u201388 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0050/0175.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Giachini2000>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3761484 |vauthors=Giachina AJ, Oliviera VL, Castellano MA, Trappe JM |year=2000 |title=Ectomycorrhizal fungi in ''Eucalyptus'' and ''Pinus'' plantations in southern Brazil |journal=Mycologia |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=1166\u201377 |jstor=3761484}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Guevara1987>{{cite journal |vauthors=Guevara G, Garcia J, Castillo J, Miller OK |year=1987 |title=New records of ''Lactarius'' in Mexico |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=30 |pages=157\u201376 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0030/0157.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hesler1979>{{cite book |title=North American Species of ''Lactarius'' |vauthors=Hesler LR, Smith AH |year=1979 |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Michigan |isbn=0-472-08440-2 |pages=366\u201371 |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=fung1tc;cc=fung1tc;sid=c9eed00f57eb4cae87faf520e74fdb71;q1=aac3719;op2=And;op3=And;rgn=mainheader;rgn1=citation;rgn2=author;rgn3=author;idno=AAC3719.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000378}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=McKnight1987>{{cite book |vauthors=McKnight VB, McKnight KH |title=A Field Guide to Mushrooms: North America | series=Peterson Field Guides |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Massachusetts |year=1987 |page=339 |isbn=0-395-91090-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlUofMichHerb\">{{cite web |title=''Lactarius argillaceifolius''; Russulaceae  (MICH11107) |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/h/herb4ic/x-mich11107/mich11107.tif |publisher=University of Michigan Herbarium |work=Fungus and Lichen Type Collection |accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlCalifornisFungi\">{{cite web |title=''Lactarius argillaceifolius''  var.

Deriving its common name from when it first appears in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], namely on [[St George's Day]] (23 April). It appears in March in Italy, a warmer country where it is also a popular mushroom to eat,<ref name = \"Carluccio03\">{{cite book | author = [[Antonio Carluccio|Carluccio A]] | year = 2003 | title = The Complete Mushroom Book| publisher = Quadrille | isbn = 1-84400-040-0 |page=75}}</ref> and is known there as ''marzolino''. It is also popular in Northern Spain and Southern France, in the Basque Country region and its surroundings where it appears in April. In these regions it is usually eaten [[saut\u00e9]]ed with egg or with bacon.\n\nIt is considered a delicacy, especially when fried in butter. It was previously considered a part of the large genus ''[[Tricholoma]]'' and is still seen as ''T. gambosum'' in older texts.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nInitially [[species description|described]] as ''Agaricus gambosus'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in his 1821 work ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'',<ref name=fries1821>{{cite book|author=Fries EM|title=Systema Mycologicum|publisher=Ex Officina Berlingiana|location=Lundae|date=1821|volume=1|pages=50|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4338094}}</ref> with its [[botanical name|specific epithet]] derived from a [[Latin]] term for \"club footed\" in relation to its bulky [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]].<ref name = \"Carluccio03\"/> It was later named ''Tricholoma gambosum'' by [[Paul Kummer]] in 1871,<ref name=Kummer1871/> before being reclassified as ''Calocybe gambosa'' by [[Marinus Anton Donk]] in 1962.<ref name=\"Donk 1962\"/> In Germany it is known as ''Maipilz'', where it fruits in May.<ref name =Zeitl76/> The genus name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] terms ''kalos'' \"pretty\", and ''cubos'' \"head\".<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Nilson S, Persson O| year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page=24}}</ref> In Denmark it is called ''V\u00e5rmousseron'', appearing in spring - early May <ref>http://www.mycokey.org/result_textsearch.shtml?action=refresh&14945</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] measures from 5\u201315&nbsp;cm (2 to 6 inches) in diameter and has a smooth texture and has ridges on it. The colour of the cap, stipe and [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] can range from white-creamy coloured to bright yellow. The sinuate [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white and crowded. The flesh is thick and soft and has a mealy or [[cucumber]] smell. The [[spore print]] is white to pinkish white. The stubby stipe is bulky at the base.<ref name = \"Carluccio03\"/>\n\nCare must be taken not to confuse it with the highly poisonous ''[[Inocybe erubescens]]'', which grows in the same habitats. The latter has a more pungent fruity smell and bruises red. ''[[Entoloma sinuatum]]'', also poisonous, has a rancid smell.<ref name =Zeitl76>{{cite book|author=Zeitlmayr L|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms:An Illustrated Handbook|publisher=Garden City Press, Hertfordshire|isbn= 0-584-10324-7|pages=70}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nIt is common in grasslands in [[Europe]], often in areas rich in limestone. It is common on the Swedish islands [[\u00d6land]] and [[Gotland]], both situated in the [[Baltic sea]]. On the [[South Downs]] in southern England, it has formed huge [[fairy ring]]s that appear to be several hundred years old.<ref name = \"Ramsbottom53\">{{cite book | author = Ramsbottom J | year = 1953 | title = Mushrooms & Toadstools | publisher = Collins | isbn = 1-870630-09-2 |page=125}}</ref> It is found from April in the United Kingdom, and earlier in warmer countries.<ref name = \"Carluccio03\"/>\n\n==Edibility==\nThe mushroom is best picked in dry weather. It can be eaten dry, pickled or even raw. It is imported in commercial quantities into Western Europe from [[Romania]].<ref name = \"Carluccio03\"/> It was held in high esteem in medieval Italy, reported by [[Costanzo Felici]] in 1569 as the most expensive and highly regarded mushroom in Umbria\nand Marches in central Italy, and held in high esteem in the Apennine mountain region\u2014Liguria, Tuscany, and Emilia-Romagna)\u2014by [[Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti]] in 1777. It is still locally eaten in Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany.<ref name=\"Sitta 2008\">{{cite journal|author1=Sitta, Nicola |author2=Floriani, Marco |date=2008|title=Nationalization and Globalization Trends in the Wild Mushroom Commerce of Italy with Emphasis on Porcini ( Boletus edulis and Allied Species)|journal=Economic Botany|volume=62|issue=3|pages=307\u201322|doi=10.1007/s12231-008-9037-4}}</ref><!-- cites previous 2 sentences -->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Donk 1962\">{{cite book |author=Donk MA. |title=The generic names proposed for the Agaricaceae |series=Beihefte zur Nova Hedwigia |location=Weinheim, Germany |year=1962 |volume=5 |page=46}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kummer1871>{{cite book |title=Der F\u00fchrer in die Pilzkunde |edition=1 |author=Kummer, Paul|authorlink=Paul Kummer |year=1871 |location=Zerbst, Germany |publisher=Luppe |page=131|language=de|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/34209700}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Calocybe gambosa}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q731944}}\n\n[[Category:Lyophyllaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1821]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi found in fairy rings]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Elias Magnus Fries]]"}]}}}}

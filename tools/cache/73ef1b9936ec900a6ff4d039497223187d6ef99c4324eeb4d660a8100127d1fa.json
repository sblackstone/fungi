It is known by a variety of [[common name]]s, including the '''painted slipperycap''', the '''painted suillus''' or the '''red and yellow suillus'''. ''Suillus spraguei'' has had a complex [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] history, and is also frequently referred to as ''Suillus pictus'' in the literature. The readily identifiable [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are dark red when fresh, dry to the touch, and covered with mats of hairs and scales that are separated by yellow cracks. On the underside of the cap are small, yellow, angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages. The [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] bears a grayish cottony [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales.\n\n''Suillus spraguei'' grows in a [[mycorrhizal]] association with several [[pine]] species, particularly [[eastern white pine]], and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn. It has a [[disjunct distribution]], and is found in eastern Asia, northeastern North America, and Mexico throughout the range of the host tree. The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]]; opinions about its quality vary. The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other ''[[Suillus]]'' species, including the closely related ''[[Suillus decipiens|S.&nbsp;decipiens]]''; the species can be differentiated by variations in color and size.\n\n==Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming==\n''Suillus spraguei'' has had a complex [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history. The first specimen was originally collected in [[New England]] in 1856 by [[Charles James Sprague]], and a formal scientific [[species description|description]] was published in 1872 when [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] called it ''Boletus spraguei''. In a publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] named the species ''Boletus pictus''. Berkeley and Curtis had also described what they believed to be a new species\u2014''Boletus murraii''\u2014although this was later considered by [[Rolf Singer]] to be merely a younger version of their ''Boletus spraguei''.<ref name=Singer1945/> Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, but the date stamp on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis publication, thus establishing nomenclatural [[Principle of Priority|priority]] under the rules of [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|fungal naming]].<ref name=Snell1945/> In 1945 Singer reported that the name ''Boletus pictus'' was illegitimate because it was a [[homonym]], already being used for a [[polypore]] mushroom described by [[Carl Friedrich Schultz]] in 1806.<ref name=Singer1945/>{{#tag:ref|According to Streinz (1862), ''Boletus pictus'' Schultz is probably the same species as ''Polyporus perennis'' (L.)

The stem is {{convert|4|to|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|1|to|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} thick, roughly cylindrical in shape, or sometimes with a bulbous bottom so as to be somewhat club-shaped.<ref name=\"NAB p.246-247\"/><ref name=Grund1976/> The stem surface is [[tomentose]], with scales at the top, and a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the upper half of the stem.

This renders it unlikely to be confused with other species,<ref name=Russell2009/> but it shares similar characteristics with several other ''Suillus'' species. ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' bears some resemblance to the rosy larch bolete (''[[Suillus ochraceoroseus|S.&nbsp;ochraceoroseus]]''),<ref>Given in the source as ''Fuscoboletinus ochraceoroseus'', but this species has since been transferred to the genus ''Suillus''. See ''[http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=324339 Suillus ochraceoroseus]'' at Index Fungorum.</ref> but the latter species has a darker spore print, a thicker stem, and grows in association with [[larch]].<ref name=Arora1986/> ''[[Suillus cavipes|S.&nbsp;cavipes]]'', another associate of larch trees, is more brownish and has a hollow stalk.<ref>Bessette ''et al.'' (2001), p. 233.</ref> ''[[Suillus lakei|S.&nbsp;lakei]]'' is less brightly colored than ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'', has a shorter stalk, and usually grows with [[Douglas fir]].<ref>Bessette ''et al.'' (2001), pp. 242\u201343.</ref> ''[[Suillus decipiens|S.&nbsp;decipiens]]'' has a less intensely red cap when young, but the color of older specimens fade and can resemble ''S.&nbsp;spraguei''. ''S.&nbsp;decipiens'' generally has a smaller stature, with a cap ranging from {{convert|4|to|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and stem that is typically {{convert|4|\u2013|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.7|\u2013|1.6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Further, its pores are irregular in shape, measuring 0.5\u20131&nbsp;mm in diameter at maturity, and stain a shade of [[hazel (color)|hazel]] rather than reddish to brownish. It is found in the southeastern United States, from [[New Jersey]] south to [[Florida]] and west to [[Texas]].<ref>Bessette ''et al.''

''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and [[rhizomorph]]s that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath.<ref name=Randall1986/> The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with [[Pinus classification|white pine]], a grouping of trees classified in [[subgenus]] ''Strobus'' of the genus ''Pinus''.<ref name=Hirose2010/> Under controlled [[pure culture]] conditions in the laboratory, ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' has also been shown to form associations with [[red pine]], [[pitch pine]], and [[loblolly pine]].<ref name=Palm1984/> Asian populations have been associated with [[Korean pine]], [[Chinese white pine]],<ref name=Wu2000/> [[Siberian dwarf pine]] and [[Japanese white pine]].<ref name=Hirose2007/> In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other [[bolete]]s, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July\u2013September),<ref>Bessette ''et al.''

In the [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] stage of ''H.&nbsp;completus'', it appears initially as patches of whitish [[mold]] on the surface of the cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce [[conidia]] (asexual spores). In the [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes [[perithecia]], [[ascus|asci]]-containing sexual structures that produce [[ascospore]]s.

The production of ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random\u2014the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat.<ref name=Kikuchi2003/> The results also suggested that ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low [[forest floor|litter]] accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication.

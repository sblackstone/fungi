The doubtfully edible mushroom has a reddish-brown bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|4.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The thin [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall, whitish to yellow-brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish-brown towards the base in maturity, where they are covered by a yellowish [[mycelia|mycelium]] that can be up to a third of the length of the stem. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are pale brown to pinkish, and the [[spore print]] is white. It is a widespread [[saprobic]] fungus, and has been found in Europe, North Africa, Asia, Australasia, and North America, where it grows in small groups or tufts on fallen logs and stumps, especially of [[oak]]. British mycologist [[E.J.H. Corner]] has described two [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of the mushroom from [[Borneo]]. Lookalike species with which ''M.&nbsp;inclinata'' may be confused include ''[[Mycena galericulata|M.&nbsp;galericulata]]'' and ''[[Mycena maculata|M.&nbsp;maculata]]''.\n\n==Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming==\nFirst described as ''Agaricus inclinatus'' by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838,<ref name=Fries1838/> it was assigned its current name in 1872 by [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]].<ref name=Quelet1872/> ''Mycena galericulata'' var. ''calopus'' (named by [[Petter Karsten|Karsten]] in 1879), and its [[basionym]] ''Agaricus galericulatus'' var. ''calopus'' (named by Fries in 1873), are [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena inclinata\"/>\n\nIn a [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] study of the large subunit [[ribosomal DNA]] sequences of [[mycorrhizal]] fungi of the orchid ''[[Gastrodia confusa]]'', ''M.&nbsp;inclinata'' was found to be closely related to ''[[Mycena aurantiomarginata|M.&nbsp;aurantiomarginata]]'', ''[[Mycena crocata|M.&nbsp;crocata]]'', and ''[[Mycena leaiana|M.&nbsp;leaiana]]''.<ref name=OguraTsujita2009/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''inclinata'' means \"bent in\".<ref name=Rea1922/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"clustered bonnet\"<ref name=BMS/> or the \"oak-stump bonnet cap\".<ref name=\"Pegler 2000\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[image:Mycena inclinata 60197.jpg|thumb|left|The stems gradually become deep brown near the base.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is light reddish-brown, with a diameter typically ranging from {{convert|1|to|4.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Initially conic to bell-shaped to convex, it flattens during maturity, developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap.<ref name=Miller2006/> The margin of the cap  has minute but distinct scallops.<ref name=Kibby1994/> The surface is moist and smooth, and [[hygrophanous]]. The cap frequently develops splits in the margin, or cracks in the disc (the central part of the cap). The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere, grayish to whitish, fragile, and with a slightly mealy odor and taste. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have a decurrent attachment to the stem (that is, running down the length of the stem) and are a pale brownish color with tinges of red. They are broad (between 3 and 6&nbsp;mm), and have a close to subdistant spacing, with about 26\u201335 gills reaching the stem.<ref name=\"Smith p.338-40\"/> The fragile [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|3|to|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.15|to|0.4|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick and yellow to yellow-brown, becoming reddish-brown to orange-brown in the bottom half in maturity. The lower portion of young stems is covered with white flecks. Roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom, the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish [[mycelia|mycelium]] that can be up to a third of the length of the stem.<ref name=Treu1996/>  The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is \"doubtful\" and consumption \"best avoided\".<ref name=Kibby1994/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are 7\u20139 by 5\u20136.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]], broadly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, and strongly [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] (it turns black when treated with [[Melzer's reagent]]). The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous, club-shaped, 26\u201336 by 5\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm, and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the gills is homogeneous, and pale yellowish to dirty brown when [[staining|stained]] in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a distinct [[wikt:pellicle|pellicle]], a well-differentiated hypoderm (a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle), and a filamentous tramal body (gill tissue); it is pale yellowish to sordid brownish in iodine stain.<ref name=\"Smith p.338-40\">Smith, pp. 338\u201340.</ref>\n\n===Varieties===\n[[E.J.H. Corner]] defined the [[variety (botany)|varieties]] ''M.&nbsp;inclinata'' var. ''kinabaluensis'' and var. ''subglobospora'' in his 1994 publication on [[Agaric]] mushrooms of [[Malesia]], a biogeographical region straddling the boundary of the [[Indomalaya ecozone|Indomalaya]] and [[Australasia ecozone]]s. The variety ''kinabaluensis'' (named after its [[type locality (biology)|type locality]], [[Mount Kinabalu|Kinabalu]]) has a cap margin that is not scalloped, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found growing on the dead wood of ''[[Lithocarpus havilandii]]'', a [[stone oak]] tree in the [[Fagaceae|beech]] family. Variety ''subglobospora'', found in [[Sabah]], has spores that are almost spherical.<ref name=Corner1994/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[image:Mycena galericulata 60303.jpg|thumb|right|''M. galericulata'' is a lookalike species.]]\n''[[Mycena maculata]]'' bears some resemblance to ''M.&nbsp;inclinata'', but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and is found in eastern North America, and sometimes on [[oak]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in ''M.&nbsp;inclinata''.<ref name=Miller2006/> ''M.&nbsp;inclinata'' is often confused with the [[edible mushroom|edible]] ''[[Mycena galericulata|M.&nbsp;galericulata]]'', a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. ''M.&nbsp;galericulata'' typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins.<ref name=Kibby1994/> ''[[Mycena polygramma|M.&nbsp;polygramma]]'' has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray.<ref name=\"Pegler 2000\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Mycena inclinata'' is a [[saprobic]] fungus, deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in [[plant litter]] such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It accomplishes this by producing [[enzyme]]s capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant [[cell wall]]s found in litter: [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[lignin]].<ref name=Steffen2007/>\n\nThe fruit bodies of ''Mycena inclinata'' grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps (especially [[oak]] and [[chestnut]]) during the spring and autumn.<ref name=\"Pegler 2000\"/><ref name=\"Smith p.338-40\"/> The fungus forms a white, woolly mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves.<ref name=Steffen2007/> Occasionally, it can be found growing on a living tree.<ref name=Treu1996/> In eastern North America, it is abundant in the area bounded by [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]], [[Manitoba]], [[Missouri]], [[North Carolina]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]. It has been found in [[Oregon]], but the species appears to be generally rare along the [[Pacific Coast]].<ref name=\"Smith p.338-40\"/> The range of the fungus also includes Europe, the [[Canary Islands]], North Africa, East Siberia, Japan,<ref name=Treu1996/> Malesia,<ref name=Corner1994/> Turkey,<ref name=Hoiland2008/> and New Zealand.<ref name=Stevenson1964/>\n\n==Chemistry==\nIn a study of the [[trace metal]] concentrations of various mushrooms species found in [[Ordu]] (Turkey), ''M.&nbsp;inclinata'' was found to have comparatively high levels of [[iron]]  (628&nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] per [[kilogram|kg]]) and [[nickel]] (21.6&nbsp;mg/kg), measured on a [[dry matter|dry weight]] basis.<ref name=Mendil2005/> Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to [[aluminum]].<ref name=Hoiland2008/> The fungus has been investigated for its ability to decolorize [[synthetic dyes]] that are used in the textile, plastics, biomedical and foodstuff industries. The dyes are not readily [[biodegradable]], and when discharged into the environment are [[persistent organic pollutant|persistent]] and many are toxic.<ref name=Baldrian2006/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bioluminescent fungi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Baldrian2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baldrian P, \u0160najdr J |title=Production of ligninolytic enzymes by litter-decomposing fungi and their ability to decolorize synthetic dyes |journal=Enzyme and Microbial Technology |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=1023\u20139 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.enzmictec.2006.02.011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BMS>{{cite web |url=http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/ENGLISH_NAMES.pdf |title=Recommended English Names for Fungi in the UK |publisher=[[British Mycological Society]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716083053/http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/ENGLISH_NAMES.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Corner1994>{{cite journal |author=Corner EJH. |title=Agarics in Malesia.

A [[monotypic taxon|monotypic]] genus, it contains the single species '''''Polyozellus multiplex''''', first described in 1899, and [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''blue chanterelle''', the '''clustered blue chanterelle''', or, in [[Alaska]], the '''black chanterelle'''. The distinctive [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of this species comprises blue- to purple-colored clusters of vase- or spoon-shaped [[Pileus (mycology)|caps]] with veiny wrinkles on the undersurface that run down the length of the [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]].\n\n''Polyozellus'' has had a varied [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history and has been [[classification (biology)|reclassified]] several times at both the [[family (biology)|family]] and genus level.  The [[range (biology)|range]] of ''Polyozellus'' includes North America and eastern Asia, where ''P.&nbsp;multiplex'' may be found growing on the ground in [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forests]], usually under [[spruce]] and [[fir]] trees. It is an [[edible mushroom|edible]] species, and has been harvested for commercial purposes. ''Polyozellus multiplex'' contains the [[bioactive compound]] [[polyozellin]], shown to have various [[physiology|physiological]] properties, including suppressive effects on [[stomach cancer]].\n\n==History and taxonomy==\n\nThe first published [[species description|description]] of the species was written by botanist [[Lucien Marcus Underwood|Lucien M. Underwood]] in 1899, based on a specimen found the previous year in the woods of [[Mount Desert, Maine]]. Although he called the new species a ''[[Cantharellus]]'', he noted that \"the plant is a remarkable one and from its habit might well form a distinct genus since it has little in common with ''Cantharellus'' except its fold-like gills.\"<ref name=Underwood1899/> In 1910, [[William Murrill]] transferred it to the new genus ''Polyozellus''; Murrill thought the compound structure of the stem to be a sufficiently unique characteristic to warrant it being separated from ''Cantharellus'' species, which have simpler stem structures.<ref name=Murrill1910/> In 1920, specimens from a Japanese collection compiled by A.&nbsp;Yasuda were sent to mycologist [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]], who believed the fungus to be a new species and named it ''Phyllocarbon yasudai''.<ref name=Lloyd1921/>[[File:Gomphus clavatus1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A light brown fungus made of a cluster of several funnel-shaped ruffled segments fused at a common base, growing on the forest floor.|''Polyozellus multiplex'' was once considered to be an extreme [[Plant life-form|growth form]] of ''[[Gomphus clavatus]]'', shown here.]]No further collections of the fungus were reported until 1937, when it was found in [[Quebec]], Canada.<ref name=Mounce1937/> The next year, Paul Shope considered the genus ''Polyozellus'' to be superfluous, pointed out that the compound [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] and the wrinkled [[hymenium]] were instead consistent with the genus ''[[Craterellus]]''.<ref name=Shope1938/> In 1939, American mycologist [[Lee Oras Overholts]], in a letter to the journal ''[[Mycologia]]'', opined that both of these authors had overlooked a 1925 publication by [[Calvin Henry Kauffman]], who made notes and photos of the species collected in the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[Wyoming]] and [[Colorado]], and in the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]].<ref name=Kauffman1925/> Kauffman believed the species to be merely \"a very extreme growth condition\" of ''Cantharellus clavatus'' (now known as ''[[Gomphus clavatus]]'') and suggested there was no reason for transferring the species to the genus ''Craterellus''.<ref name=Overholts1939/> Mycologists [[Alexander Hanchett Smith|Alexander H.&nbsp;Smith]] and [[Elizabeth Eaton Morse]], in their 1947 publication on ''Cantharellus'' species in the United States, placed the species in a new section ''Polyozellus'', but did not separate it from the genus ''Cantharellus''; they defined the distinguishing characteristics of ''Polyozellus'' as the small, roughened, [[hyaline]] spores and the color change of the flesh in [[potassium hydroxide]] solution, adding that \"the spores are unusual for the genus but in our estimation do not warrant excluding the species.\"<ref name=Smith1947/>\n[[File:Polyozellus_multiplex_-Haida_Guaii.jpg|thumb|alt=A specimen found on Moresby Island, Haida Guaii|''Polyozellus multiplex'' \u2013 [[Haida Gwaii]]]]\nIn 1953, Rokuya Imazeki took into consideration differences in [[spore]] characteristics: species in the genus ''Cantharellus'' were not known to have spores that were subglobose (roughly spherical) and tuberculate (covered with wart-like projections) like ''Polyozellus''; however, these spore characteristics were common in species in the Thelephoraceae family (''Cantharellus'' belongs in a different family, the [[Cantharellaceae]]). Other characteristics linking the blue chanterelle with the Thelephoraceae included the dark color, the strong odor (especially in dried specimens), and the presence of [[thelephoric acid]], a mushroom  [[pigment]] common in the family. Taken together, these factors led Imazeki to propose the new family Phylacteriaceae.<ref name=Sawada1952/> The suggested family-level [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] change was not accepted by other authors; for example, in 1954, Seiichi Kawamura renamed it ''Thelephora multiplex''.<ref name=Kawamura1954/> As of 2009, both [[Index Fungorum]]<ref name=\"urlFungorum\"/> and [[MycoBank]]<ref name=\"urlStalpers2009\"/> list ''Polyozellus'' as being within the Thelephoraceae family, a grouping of mushrooms commonly known as the [[leathery earthfans]].<ref name=\"Pilz p17 2003\">Pilz ''et al''., p. 17.</ref> The genus name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''poly'' meaning ''many'', and ''oz'', meaning ''branch''.<ref name=Richard1993/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''multiplex'' means \"in many pieces\", referring to the compound nature of the fruit body.<ref name=Weber1980/> [[Common name]]s for this species include the blue chanterelle and the clustered blue chanterelle.<ref name=Ammirati1987/> In [[Alaska]], where specimens typically have very dark-colored fruit bodies, it is called the black chanterelle,<ref name=\"Pilz p38 2003\">Pilz ''et al''., p. 38.</ref> although this name is shared with some ''[[Craterellus]]'' species.<ref name=Arora1991/>\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Polyozellus multiplex 23792.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A light blue fungus made of a cluster of fan- or funnel-shaped ruffled segments fused at a common base, growing on the ground|Specimen from [[Lake Wenatchee]] area,  Washington State, US]]\n\n''Polyozellus multiplex'' is part of the group of fungi collectively known as cantharelloid mushrooms (which includes the genera ''[[Cantharellus]]'', ''Craterellus'', ''[[Gomphus (fungus)|Gomphus]]'', and ''Polyozellus'') because of the similarity of their [[fruit body]] structures and the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the spore-producing region (the [[hymenophore]]) on the underside of the caps.<ref name=Richard1993/> The fan- or funnel-shaped fruit bodies of the black chanterelle grow clustered together on the ground, often in large masses that may reach aggregate diameters of up to {{convert|1|m|ft|sp=us|1}},<ref name=\"Shope1938\" /><ref name=Smith1947/> although they are usually up to {{convert|30|cm|in|1|sp=us}}.<ref name=McKnight1987/>\n\nThe individual [[Pileus (mycology)|caps]], {{convert|3|\u2013|5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} wide and almost as long, are violet-black, with edges that are initially whitish, and with a [[glaucous]] surface\u2014a white powdery accumulation of spore deposit.<ref name=Underwood1899/>  The upper surface may be [[wikt:zonate|zonate]]\u2014lined with what appear to be multiple concentric zones of texture caused by areas of fine hairs (a [[Trichome#Plant trichomes|tomentum]]); and the edges of the caps have a layer of very fine hairs and are lobed and wavy. The underside of the caps bears the fertile, spore-making tissue called the [[hymenium]], which typically has shallow, crowded wrinkles or veins that are roughly the same color or paler than the top surface.<ref name=Arora1986/> Some variation in color has been observed depending on the collection location. For example, specimens found in Alaska are more likely to be jet-black in color with a dark gray underside.<ref name=Arora1991/>\n\nFruit bodies may be up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} high (including the stem) and {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} wide.

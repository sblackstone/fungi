It is differentiated, however, by its lack of an [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]], by the [[volva (mycology)|volval]] deposits on its [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]/base, and by its [[pileus (mycology)|pileal]] striations. It occasionally lacks a stipe bulb entirely, instead just tapering to a point in the ground with powdery volval deposits on its surface. It ranges from {{convert|3|\u2013|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and is occasional to common in the [[Southeastern United States]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Bessette |first=Alan R. |author2=William Roody |author3=Areleen Bessette |author4=Dail Dunway  |title= Mushrooms of the Southeastern United States |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year= 2007 |isbn=0-8156-3112-X}}</ref> occurring primarily in ''[[Quercus]]'' forests though it has been observed in forests with a mix of [[conifers]] and [[oak]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mushroomexpert.com/Amanita_parcivolvata.html |title= Amanita parcivolvata |last1= Kuo |first1= Michael |date= March 2008 |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThis ''[[Amanita]]'' is in the subgenus ''Amanita'' and in the section ''Amanita''. It was first described by [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1900 as ''Amanitopsis parcivolvata''.  [[William Alphonso Murrill|Murrill]] the placed it in the now defunct genus, ''Vaginata, ''in 1910, comparing it to the local specimens of  ''[[Amanita vaginata|Vaginata plumbea]]'' in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]] and finding it distinct.<ref>{{cite book  | last = New York Botanical Garden | editor-last = Murrill  | title = ''Mycologia, Volume V'' | page = 83 | publisher = Mycological Society of America  | year = 1913}}</ref> However, it was not formally described in literature until 1913. J.E. Gilbert placed in the genus ''[[Amanita]]'' in 1941, where it resides to this day.\n\n==Description==\n\n'''Cap''': The [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] is bright red ranging from  {{convert|3|\u2013|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter with warts which range in color from pale yellow to white. With rain, these can wash off, giving it a somewhat similar appearance to an ''[[Amanita]]'' in ''[[Amanita jacksonii|section Caesareae]]'' from a distance, especially if all but the cap is covered by [[detritus]].\n\n'''Gills''': The [[lamellae (mycology)|lamellae]] are white to pale yellow, closely spaced, free from the stipe, and sometimes with a serrated margin.\n\n'''Stipe''':  {{convert|3|\u2013|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and about {{convert|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width, with pale yellow to white powdery volval remnants all along the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. The volva, if it even may be called that, is rather undeveloped as compared to other members of ''[[Amanita]]''.\n\n'''Microscopic Features''': According to Rod Tulloss, the spores of ''Amanita parcivolvata'' measure (8.4-) 9.1-11.5 (-12.6) X (5.6-) 6.3-7.9 (-8.0) [[micrometer|\u03bcm]], are [[inamyloid]], and the [[basidium|basidia]] rarely have [[clamp connection|clamps]] at bases.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/species/Amanita/parcivol.html |title= Amanita parcivolvata |last1= Tulloss |first1= Rod |accessdate= December 25, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n'''Chemical Reactions''': With [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]], the red color of the cap quickly fades to an orange, then yellow color.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Amanita parcivolvata\">{{cite web |title=''Amanita parcivolvata'' (Peck) J.E.

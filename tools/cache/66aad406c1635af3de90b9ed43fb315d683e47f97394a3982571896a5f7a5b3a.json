It is commonly referred to as the '''iodine bolete''', because its fruit bodies tend to emit an [[Povidone-iodine|iodine]] odour when cut, more detectable in the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] base or overripe specimens. \n\nLike other members of the family, ''H. impolitum'' has tubes and pores instead of [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] in the [[hymenium|hymenial]] surface of its fruit bodies. It is widely distributed in temperate and southern [[Europe]], where it grows in [[mycorrhizal]] [[symbiosis]] with [[broad-leaved]] trees, particularly oak (''[[Quercus]]''). \n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\nThe iodine bolete was first described by [[Elias Magnus Fries]], an eminent mycologist of the 19th century, who placed the fungus in genus ''[[Boletus]]''.<ref>Fries, E. (1838). Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici. :1-610</ref> The [[Latin]] epithet ''impolitum'' (meaning \"rough\"), likely refers to the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the species, which is initially felty and covered in a finely filamentous coating when viewed under a [[magnifying glass]]. The species' taxonomic position had long remained uncertain and various authors had placed it in different genera in the past, including the now abandoned genera ''Tubiporus''<ref>Karsten PA. (1882). Rysslands, Finlans och den Skandinaviska half\u00f6ns Hattsvampar. Sednare Delen: Pip-, Tagg-, Hud-, Klubb- och Gel\u00e9svampar. Bidrag till K\u00e4nnedom av Finlands Natur och Folk. 37: 1\u2013257</ref> and ''Versipellis''.<ref>Qu\u00e9let L. (1886). Enchir. fung. (Paris): 158</ref> \n\nBased on preliminary analysis of the [[28S ribosomal RNA]] locus, mycologists Manfred Binder and Halmut Besl placed the species in ''[[Xerocomus]]'' in 2000.<ref name=\"BINDER & BESL 2000\"/> However, in 2008 Josef \u0160utara transferred the fungus to the new genus ''[[Hemileccinum]]'', based on its distinctive morphology.<ref name=\"\u0160utara 2008\"/> More elaborate [[phylogenetic]] studies by Wu and colleagues in 2014, confirmed that the iodine bolete does not belong in ''[[Boletus]]'', ''[[Xerocomus]]'' or ''[[Leccinum]]'', since collections identified as this species occupied a distinct phylogenetic [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] within the subfamily of Xerocomoideae, closely related to ''[[Corneroboletus]]''.<ref name=\"Wu 2014\"/> Subsequent contributions by R. Halling and colleagues,<ref name=\"Halling 2015\"/> and M. Loizides and colleagues,<ref name=\"Loizides 2019\"/> have since confirmed the [[monophyly]] of the genus, which presently includes just two [[Europe]]an species: ''H. impolitum'' and ''[[H. depilatum]]''.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Boletus impolitus 2009 G1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Iodine Bolete found in Ukraine]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] diameter usually ranges between {{convert|5|and|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, but can reach {{convert|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. It is at first hemispherical, gradually becoming convex as the fungus expands and finally flat in fully mature specimens, sometimes with a slightly uplifted margin. The colour ranges from light tan, pale brown, chestnut-brown, grey, ochraceous-brown, greyish-brown or olivaceous-brown and the cap of young fruit bodies is initially covered in a velvety, finely filamentous silvery-grey coating that disappears in age.<ref name=\"Courtecuisse 1995\"/><ref name=\"Galli 2007\"/> \n\nThe [[cap cuticle]] turns violet with NH<sub>3</sub> ([[ammonia]]).<ref name=\"\u0160utara 2008\"/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is cylindrical, clavate or ventricose, {{convert|5|to|15|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|2|to|6|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, cream to pale yellow, but typically lemon-yellow at the apex and usually narrowing at the base. It has no reticulation (net), but is covered in tiny pustules (scabrosities) below the apex, sometimes browning with age.<ref name=\"Ladurner 2003\"/><ref name=\"\u0160utara 2008\"/> \n\nThe tubes are pale yellow to lemon-yellow and usually do not discolour when cut, but may rarely stain faintly greenish-brown. The pores are small and rounded, lemon-yellow to chrome-yellow, not discolouring or rarely staining greenish-brown where handled or injured. The flesh is thick, soft, pale yellow to whitish, usually remaining the same colour when cut, or rarely becoming faintly pinkish-brown above the tubes and at the stem base. It has a sour smell somewhat reminiscent of iodine, more pronounced at the stem base.<ref name=Phillips06/><ref name=\"Ladurner 2003\"/> \n\nThe [[spore print]] is olivaceous-brown.<ref name=H&R1992/> \n\nThe spores are fusiform (spindle-shaped) or fusiform-ellipsoid, measuring 10\u201316 \u00d7 4\u20136 \u03bcm.<ref name=\"Breitenbach 1991\"/> Although under an [[optical microscope]] they appear perfectly smooth, when viewed with a [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscope (SEM)]] fine warts and tiny \u201cpin-pricks\u201d are visible on their surface.<ref name=\"Wu 2014\"/> The [[Pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a trichodermium, composed of cylindrical smooth hyphae with clavate terminal cells that later collapse in mature specimens.<ref name=\"\u0160utara 2008\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n*''[[Hemileccinum depilatum]]'' is the sister-species of ''H. impolitum'' and morphologically very similar, differing by its wrinkled or \"hammered\" cap surface, and its association hornbeam (''[[Carpinus]]'') or hop-hornbeam (''[[Ostrya]]''). Microscopically it is distinguished by the structure of its cap cuticle, which is a palisadoderm composed of spherical and shortly cylindrical cells.\n\n*''[[Leccinellum lepidum]]'' can also look very similar, but typically has a viscid cap with a wrinkled or \"hammered\" surface not turning violet in NH<sub>3</sub>, while its flesh slowly turns violaceous-grey and finally greyish-black when exposed to the air. Microscopically it has longer spores, often reaching 20 \u03bcm in length.\n\n*''[[Xerocomus subtomentosus]]'' lacks scabrosities on the stem surface, while its pores are larger, angular and stain bluish when bruised. When longitudinally cut, its flesh is pinkish-brown in the lower part of the stem and sometimes discolours faintly bluish in the cap.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Boletus Impolitus dried 2010 G1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dried ''Hemileccinum impolitum'']]\n''Hemileccinum impolitum'' is ecologically versatile, forming [[ectomycorrhizal]] associations with several species of oak (''[[Quercus]]''), but occasionally also with beech (''[[Fagus (plant)|Fagus]]'') and chestnut (''[[Castanea (plant)|Castanea]]''). It does not appear to be substrate-specific and has been reported from both [[calcareous]] and acidic soil.<ref name=\"Ladurner 2003\"/><ref name=\"Galli 2007\"/><ref name=\"Loizides 2019\"/> In the [[United Kingdom]], it is occasionally found in [[southern England]], although finds in other parts of the country have also been reported.<ref name=\"Watling 2005\"/><ref name=\"Kibby 2016\"/> \n\n[[Phylogenetics|Molecular phylogenetic]] testing has so far verified its presence in [[Estonia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Mediterranean]] islands of [[Cyprus]] and [[Sardinia]].<ref name=\"Halling 2015\"/><ref name=\"Loizides 2019\"/>\n\n==Edibility==\nThe iodine bolete is described as a good [[edible mushroom|edible]] species by some authors,<ref name=\"Galli 2007\"/> and inedible by others,<ref name=\"Breitenbach 1991\"/> probably because of its peculiar odour. However, it is hardly ever found in large numbers, therefore care and discretion should be exercised when harvesting this mushroom.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=H&R1992>{{cite book | author = Helmut and Renate Grunert  | year = 1992 | title = Field Guide to MUSHROOMS of Britain and Europe (English Edition) | publisher = The Crowood Press Ltd | isbn = 1-85223-592-6}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BINDER & BESL 2000\">{{cite book |vauthors=Binder M, Besl H |year=2000 |title=28S rDNA sequence data and chemo-taxonomical analyses on the ge- neric concept of Leccinum (Boletales) |publisher=Verlag Micologia 2000 |location=Trento |language=German |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nBINDER M. and BESL H.

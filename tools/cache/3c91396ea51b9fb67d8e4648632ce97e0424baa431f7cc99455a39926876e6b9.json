Found in [[tropical]] Mexico, it was described as new to science by Mexican mycologist Laura Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos in 2006.<ref name=GuzmanDavalos2006/>  The flesh of this mushroom bruises blue where bruised.<ref name=GuzmanDavalos2006/>\n\n==Systematics==\n\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] by mycologist Laura Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos in 2006 based on a type collection found on the roots of dead palm in the main city square of Puerto de Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico.<ref name=GuzmanDavalos2006/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|epithet]] ''cyanopalmicola'' refers to the blue staining fruit bodies and the microscopic similarity to [[Gymnopilus palmicola]].<ref name=GuzmanDavalos2006/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''Gymnopilus cyanopalmicola'' have yellow, convex to plane [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, with fibrillose scales that are erect near the center and appressed near the margin.  The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded, [[ventricose]], with adnate to decurrent gill attachment.  The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|40|\u2013|210|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|4|\u2013|21|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]], tapering at the base in larger fruit bodies.  It is colored yellowish white, and turns purple, dark reddish or dark brown when bruised or dried.  The stipe has a conspicuous but soon fading membranous yellowish-white annulus.  The pileus trama is light yellow, similar to the color of the cap.  The odor is fungal.<ref name=GuzmanDavalos2006/>\n\nThe verrucose [[spore]]s are ellipsoid to oblong, amygdaliform, thick walled, and lack a germ pore and plague, but have a superhilar depression.  They typically measure 8.0 - 8.8 (-11.2) x  by 5\u20136&nbsp;(6 - 8)&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].  They are [[dextrinoid]], orange-brown in KOH, not metachromatic, and have cyanophilic ornamentation.   [[Basidia]] are clear to yellowish, four spored, 26.4 - 37.5 x 6.4 - 7.7 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]], cylindrical to clavate, constricted in the middle, with sterigmata 3.2\u20134.8 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]] long.  The bases of the basidia have clamp connections.  [[Cystidia]] on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are clear to yellowish, sometimes with granulose yellow brown contents, narrowly lageniform with a subcapitate to capitate apex, and have dimensions of 21.6\u201328 \u00d7 6.4\u20137.6 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]], with an apex of 4.8\u20137.2 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]].  The base of the cheilocystidia have clamp connections.  [[Pleurocystidia]] (cystidia on the gill face) are extremely rare.   When present they are clear to yellowish, utriform, 21.6\u201326 \u00d7 7 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]], with an obtuse to subcapitate apex that has a diameter of 3.4\u20135.6 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]].  The [[hymenophoral trama]] is subparallel, clear to yellowish, with hyphae 3.4 - 14.7 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]] in diameter and many [[refractive]] drops.  The subhymenium is cellular and clear, with some elongated inflated elements.  The [[pileus trama]] is yellowish to brownish, radial, with interwoven zones near the [[pileipellis]], and has hyphae 4.8 - 8.7 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]] in diameter, with .5 to 2.5 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]] walls.  The [[cap cuticle]] is a cutis with prostrate hyphae.  The scales are a trichoderm with septate hyphae 7.2 to 23.5 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]] in diameter, with clamp connections and yellowish brown pigment encrusted in bands.  [[Pileocystidia]] are absent.  [[Caulocystidia]] are narrowly lageniform to narrowly utriform, 31 - 44 x 5.6 - 11 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]], with a 3 - 7 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]] capitate to subcapitate apex.\n\n==Similar Species==\n\n''Gymnopilus cyanopalmicola'' is closely related to ''[[Gymnopilus palmicola]]'', however that species is smaller does not stain blue.

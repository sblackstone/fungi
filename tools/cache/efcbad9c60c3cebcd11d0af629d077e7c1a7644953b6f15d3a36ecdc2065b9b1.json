It produces moderately sized and brittle [[mushroom]]s, which grow on the [[forest floor]] or on rotting wood. The flattened-convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] can vary in shape, sometimes forming the shape of a wide funnel. It is typically grey, but the colour varies. The species has crowded, light-coloured [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], which produce white [[latex|milk]]. The [[spore print]] is typically whitish, but also varies considerably. The mushrooms typically have a strong, acrid taste and have been described as inedible, but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling. ''L.&nbsp;vietus'' feeds by forming an [[ectomycorrhizal]] relationship with surrounding trees, and it favours [[birch]]. It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe, North America and eastern Asia.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Lactarius vietus'' was [[species description|first described]] by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1821 as ''Agaricus vietus'' in his ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=245540 |title=''Agaricus vietus'' Fr., Syst. mycol.

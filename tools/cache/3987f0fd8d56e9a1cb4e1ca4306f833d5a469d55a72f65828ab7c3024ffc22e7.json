The [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] seen in the mushroom is absent in maturity or is present when young as small white patches. Its [[flesh]] has a color ranging from butter yellow to yellowish under the cap skin, yellow in the center part and near the margin, from pale yellowish white to white elsewhere, the flesh is around 9 \u2013 13&nbsp;mm thick above the stem, and it thins evenly to the margin. The [[Gill (mycology)|gills]] are free, subcrowded, thickest close to the margin, and are around 9\u201312&nbsp;mm broad.\nThe stem is 124\u2013137 \u00d7 16\u201323&nbsp;mm with a pale yellowish to orange color in the upper part of the stem with light yellow as the ground color. The ring is attached in the upper part, subapical, skirt-like, copious, [[biological membrane|membranous]], persistent, orange-yellow at first, becoming yellow-orange.  The saccate volva is smooth, white, with yellow tints on the inner surface, dry, [[biological membrane|membranous]], firmly attached to the stem.  The [[flesh]] is white, staining light yellow, and stuffed with moderately dense material.<ref name=Amanitaceae/> The spores measure around approximately 9.0\u201311.8 (8.0\u201318.0) \u00d7 6.1\u20137.5(5.5\u20139.0)&nbsp;\u00b5m and are broadly [[ellipsoid]] to [[Elongation (geometry)|elongate]] (rarely cylindric) and [[inamyloid]].  Clamps are common at bases of [[basidia]].<ref name=Amanitaceae>{{cite web | url = http://www.amanitaceae.org/index.php?Amanita%20fulva | title = ''Amanita basii''|work=Amanitaceae.org |accessdate=2016-09-18}}</ref>\n\nIts stem is around 124\u2013137 (12.4-13.7&nbsp;cm) \u00d7 16\u201323 (1.6-2.3&nbsp;cm)&nbsp;mm, with a pale yellow to orange color in the upper part of the mushroom's stem with a light yellow on the ground, becoming [[brown]] to blackish with handling, stuffed, subcylindric to [[cylindrical]], with irregular ragged patches and strands of orange-yellow felted to membranous material on the outer surface; the stem decoration becomes more intensely orange when handled. The ring is attached in the upper part, subapical, skirt-like, copious, [[biological membrane|membranous]], persistent, orange-yellow at first, becoming yellow-orange.

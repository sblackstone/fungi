It feeds on decaying leaves of some woods and can be found around the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  It is a food source for various insects.\n\n== Description ==\n=== Cap ===\nThe [[Cap (mycology)|cap]] is typically around 24 \u2013 102&nbsp;mm (2.4 - 10.2&nbsp;cm) wide, is hemispheric at first then becoming broadly convex to plano-convex, occasionally also slightly depressed in center; white, pallid grayish-brown or grayish buff over disk in age, surface dull and tacky at first and becoming shiny.\n\n=== Gills ===\nThe [[Gill (mycology)|gills]] are usually narrowly[[Adnate gills|adnate]], sometimes with a decurrent line, close, whitish, becoming grayish-cream on drying, with white, floccose remnants of partial veil on edges, narrow, 4.5 \u2013 11&nbsp;mm (0.45 - 1.1&nbsp;cm) broad, sometimes [[anastomosing]]; the short gills are truncate to rounded truncate to attenuate to attenuate in steps, plentiful, of diverse lengths, unevenly distributed.\n\n=== Stem ===\nThe stem is 25 - 142 (2.5 - 14.2&nbsp;cm) \u00d7 5 \u2013 20&nbsp;mm (0.5 \u2013 2&nbsp;cm), white, and tapers upward slightly to a flaring apex.  The stem is decorated with easily removed, floccose material especially in upper portion; the flesh of the stem usually does not take on a color when bruised.  The flesh is white, occasionally graying in damaged areas, with a firmly stuffed central cylinder, up to 7&nbsp;mm wide. The ring is fibrous-floccose and rapidly evanescent. [[Volva (mycology)|Volval]] remnants are absent from the bulb and the stem base or difficult to distinguish.<ref>http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20longipes Retrieved October 17, 2016</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{CCBYSASource|sourcepath=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20longipes|sourcearticle=Amanita longipes|revision=740502386|authors(s)=Rodham E.

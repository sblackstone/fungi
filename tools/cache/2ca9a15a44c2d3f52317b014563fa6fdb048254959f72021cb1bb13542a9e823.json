It has a widespread distribution in Europe, where it is typically found in association with [[oak]] and [[beech]] trees.  Although generally considered inedible, it is consumed by some in Mexico.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is red-brown or chestnut-brown with a paler margin, very sticky when moist, and has a diameter of {{convert|4|to|8|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"isbn90-5410-492-9\">{{cite book |author=Bas, Cornelis |title=Flora agaricina Neerlandica: critical monographs on families of agarics and boleti occurring in the Netherlands|publisher=A.A.

The margins of the caps are usually turned inwards. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded together, [[Lamella (mycology)|adnate]] or [[Lamella (mycology)|emarginate]] in attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and white or a light [[ochraceous]] yellow with dark brown stains when old or bruised. The stipe is {{convert|4|to|10|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} thick, roughly spindle-shaped ([[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]]), with red-brown [[fibrils]] and a sharply defined zone of white color at the stalk apex, especially in more mature specimens.<ref name=\"isbn0-89815-169-4\"/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white or cream, smelling strongly of [[flour|meal]], with a bitter taste.<ref>[http://www.grzyby.pl/gatunki/Tricholoma_ustale.htm Gryzyby\u2015Fungi of Poland]</ref><ref name=\"isbn0-7153-0129-2\"/>\n\n[[Spore]]s have a roughly spherical or ellipsoid shape, are [[hyaline]], smooth, non-[[amyloid]], and have dimensions of 5.5\u20147.0 x 4.5\u20145.5 [[micrometre|\u00b5m]].<ref name=\"isbn90-5410-492-9\"/> [[Basidia]] are 4-spored and [[cystidia]] are absent.<ref name=\"isbn0-7153-0129-2\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\nThis [[mycorrhizal]] species typically grows in small groups, and is often found near trees in the genera [[Quercus]] and [[Beech|Fagus]].<ref name=\"isbn90-5410-492-9\"/>\n\nAlthough relatively rare, it has a widespread distribution in [[Europe]], limited by the presence of its preferred tree hosts.

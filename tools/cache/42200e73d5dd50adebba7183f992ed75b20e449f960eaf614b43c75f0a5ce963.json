A common and widely distributed species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America, where it grows in groups or dense overlapping clusters on the logs, stumps, and trunks of [[deciduous]] trees, especially [[beech]], [[oak]], and [[birch]]. During the development of the [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], the mushrooms start out as tiny white knobs, which, over a period of one to three months, develop into fan- or kidney-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that measure up to {{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad. The caps are orange-yellow to brownish, and attached to the decaying wood by short stubby [[stipe (mycology)|stalks]] that are connected off-center or on the side of the caps. The fungus was given its current [[binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] in 1879, but has been known by many names since French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Jean Bulliard]] first described it as ''Agaricus stypticus'' in 1783. [[Molecular phylogenetic]] analysis revealed ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'' to have a close genetic relationship with members of the genus ''[[Mycena]]''.\n\n''Panellus stipticus'' is one of several dozen species of fungi that are [[bioluminescent]]. Strains from eastern North America are typically bioluminescent, but those from the Pacific coast regions of North America and from other continents are not. The luminescence is localized to the edges of the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] and the junction of the gills with the stem and cap. Bioluminescence is also observable with [[mycelia]] grown in laboratory culture, and the growth conditions for optimal light production have been studied in detail. Several chemicals have been isolated and characterized that are believed to be responsible for light production. [[Genetic analysis]] has shown that luminescence is controlled by a single [[dominance (genetics)|dominant allele]]. The luminescent glow of this and other fungi inspired the term [[foxfire]], coined by early settlers in eastern and southern North America. Modern research has probed the potential of ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'' as a tool in [[bioremediation]], because of its ability to detoxify various [[persistent organic pollutant|environmental pollutants]].\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n|clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n|label1=\n|1={{clade\n    |1={{clade\n           |1=''[[Resinomycena acadiensis]]''\n           |2={{clade\n                |1={{clade\n                      |1=''[[Dictyopanus pusillus]]''\n                      |2='''''Panellus stipticus'''''\n                      }}\n                |2={{clade\n                      |1=''[[Mycena galericulata]]''\n                      |2={{clade\n                           |1=''[[Mycena rutilanthiformis]]''\n                           |2={{clade\n                                |1=''[[Mycena clavicularis]]''\n                                |2=Other ''[[Panellus]]'' spp. and ''[[Hygrocybe citrinopallida]]''\n                                      }}\n                                 }}\n                            }}\n                       }}\n                  }}\n            }}\n       }}\n|caption=Phylogeny and relationships of ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'' and related species based on [[ribosomal DNA]] sequences<ref name=Jin2001b/>\n}}\nThe species was first named ''Agaricus stypticus'' by the French botanist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Jean Bulliard]] in 1783,<ref name=Bulliard1783/> and later [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] under this name in 1821.<ref name=Fries1821/> Fries later changed the genus as well as the spelling of the [[specific name (botany)|epithet]] and called it ''Panus stipticus''.<ref name=Fries1838/> The species has had an extensive [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history and been shuffled to a number of [[genus|genera]] by various authors, resulting in several [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]]: ''Agaricus flabelliformis'' ([[Johann Friedrich Gmelin]], 1792),<ref name=Gmelin1792/> ''Pocillaria stiptica'' ([[Otto Kuntze]], 1898),<ref name=Kuntze1898/> ''Rhipidium stipticum'' ([[Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth]], 1833),<ref name=Wallroth1833/> ''Crepidopus stipticus'' ([[Samuel Frederick Gray]], 1821),<ref name=Gray1821/> ''Pleurotus stipticus'' ([[Paul Kummer]]),<ref name=Kummer1871/> ''Lentinus stipticus'' ([[Joseph Schr\u00f6ter]], 1885),<ref name=Schroter1885/> and ''Merulius stipticus'' ([[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]).<ref name=FungorumSynonymy/> It was Finnish mycologist [[Petter Karsten]] who in 1879 assigned its current name.<ref name=Karsten1879/> ''Panellus stypticus'' is still used in the literature as a variant spelling.<ref name=MushroomExpert/>\n\n''Panellus stipticus'' is the [[type species]] of the genus ''Panellus'', and, in [[Rolf Singer]]'s authoritative 1986 classification of the [[Agaricales]], it is also the type species of [[subgenus]] ''Panellus'', an infrageneric (below the taxonomic level of genus) grouping of ''Panellus'' species characterized by the absence of [[cystidia]] on the sides of the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]].<ref name=Singer1986/> More recently, [[phylogenetic]] analyses of the sequences of their ribosomal large subunit genes have concluded that ''Panellus stipticus'' is closely related to the [[poroid]] mushroom ''Dictyopanus pusillus''.<ref name=Jin2001b/> The molecular analysis supports a previous assessment by mycologists [[Harold Bursdall]] and [[Orson K.

Each cap has about 2\u20133 dozen lightly colored thin lines of various lengths, closely spaced and arranged radially around the stem, which is connected to one side of the mushroom cap. The stem is whitish, with a width of between roughly one-third to one-fifth the diameter of the cap, and attaches the cap to the wood.]]\nThe fungus normally exists unseen, in the form of a mass of threadlike [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] cells called a [[mycelium]], inhabiting rotting wood; only when suitable environmental conditions of temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are achieved does the fungus produce the reproductive structures known as [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], or mushrooms. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the fruit body is kidney- or clamshell-shaped, convex to roughly flat, with dimensions of {{convert|1.2|to|3.2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} by {{convert|1.2|to|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Miller2006/> The edges of the caps are scalloped with small rounded teeth, and curved slightly inward. The cap surface is dry, with a pattern of block-like areas similar to cracked dried mud; the surface is also covered with small fine hairs that give it a somewhat woolly consistency. It may have several concentric ridges or zones. Fresh fruit bodies range in color from yellowish-orange to [[buff (color)|buff]] to cinnamon; when dried they may be various shades of tan, brown or clay. The faded colors of dried fruit bodies tend to revive when moistened. On the underside of the cap, the [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are narrow and spaced closely together, often forked, buff-colored, and with numerous interconnecting cross-veins. Holding the cap in position is a [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] that is {{convert|0.6|to|1.2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.3|to|0.8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and has an off-center attachment to the cap, either at or near the cap side. The dull-white stem is covered with minute silk-like fibers, and is narrower at the base where it attaches to the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. Fruit bodies do not have any distinctive odor.<ref name=Bursdall1975/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and tough, and dark yellow-brown to cream-colored.<ref name=Bas1995/>\n\n===Microscopic features===\nVarious microscopic characteristics may be used to help identify the fungus from other [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar species. A [[spore print]] of ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'', made by depositing a large number of spores in a small area, reveals their color to be white.<ref name=Bessette1987/> Viewed with a [[optical microscope|microscope]], the spores are smooth-walled, elliptical to nearly [[wikt:allantoid|allantoid]] (sausage-shaped), with dimensions of 3\u20136 by 2\u20133&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. Spores are [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning that they will absorb [[iodine]] and become bluish-black when stained with [[Melzer's reagent]],<ref name=Jordan2004/> but this staining reaction has been described as \"relatively weak\".<ref name=Jin2001b/>\n\nThe [[basidia]] (the spore-bearing cells) are 15\u201320 by 2.5\u20133.5&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, and clamped at the base.<ref name=Bursdall1975/> The spores are attached to the end of the basidia by four projections called [[sterigmata]] that are 1\u20133.5&nbsp;\u00b5m long.<ref name=Zhishu1993/> [[Cystidia]] are hyphal cells in the [[hymenium]] that do not produce basidiospores; they also make up the surfaces of the fruit body (the pelli or \"cuticles\"). They are usually structurally distinct from the basidia, and their features may be used as microscopic characters to help distinguish and differentiate similar fungi.  The [[cheilocystidia]] are found on the gill edge; in ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'' they are narrowly club-shaped, cylindrical, spindle-shaped to [[wikt:bifurcate|bifurcate]] at the apex. They are also thin-walled, [[hyaline]] (translucent), abundant and crowded, and measure 17\u201345 by 3.5\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m. The pleurocystidia, located on the gill face, are 17\u201340 by 3\u20134.5&nbsp;\u00b5m, spindle- or club-shaped, sometimes bifurcate at the apex, thin-walled, and hyaline. They are scattered or in dense clusters, mostly embedded in hymenium, occasionally protruding up to half the width of the hymenium.<ref name=Bursdall1975/>\n\nThe [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the cap consists of a number of microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the [[pileipellis]]) is between 8\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m thick,<ref name=Reid1955/> and is made of a loose ''textura intricata'', a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly interwoven with distinct spaces between them.<ref name=Bursdall1975/> The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40\u201355 by 3.5\u20135.5&nbsp;\u00b5m. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]], sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54\u201365&nbsp;\u00b5m thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2\u20133&nbsp;\u00b5m in thickness, with clamps at the septa. Below this is a zone 208\u2013221&nbsp;\u00b5m in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more or less a vertical orientation. This in turn is followed by a layer 520&nbsp;\u00b5m in thickness, formed of loosely interwoven hyphae, 2\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the septa, whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls.<ref name=Reid1955/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the cap has a layer of upright hyphae bending into a lower layer of interwoven hyphae with diameters of 2.5\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m. The flesh of the gills is similar to that of the lower cap.<ref name=Bursdall1975/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Crepidotus spec. - Lindsey 3b.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = The underside of a single whitish to light brown, fan-shaped mushroom cap growing on a piece of wood.

Those from eastern North America have a mildly acrid taste that takes time to develop, and cause uncomfortable drying in the mouth. In contrast, specimens from Japan, New Zealand, and Russia produce no sensation in the mouth, but cause significant constriction and a nauseating taste in the throat.<ref name=Petersen1992b/> The fruit bodies are reputed to have been used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] as a [[antihaemorrhagic|styptic]] to staunch bleeding,<ref name=Hobbs1995/> and also as a \"violent [[laxative|purgative]]\".<ref name=Dickinson1982/>\n\n==Fruit body development==\nFruit bodies first appear as tiny white knobs less than a cubic millimeter in size. In a day or two the knobs grow into a horizontal pyramidal mass, increasing in height as the hyphae lengthen. This is soon followed by the formation of a minute cap, and lengthening of the stem. The stem is about 1&nbsp;mm long when the cap first begins to form. The hyphae that comprise the stem gradually cease to grow at their ends, and then start to branch, with many of the branches growing in a horizontal direction. This growth, indicated by the flattening and broadening out of the top of the stem, gives rise to the cap. The horizontally aligned hyphae grow vertical branches which remain more or less parallel, ultimately forming the dorsal tissue of the cap. Other similar downward-growing branches form the fertile [[hymenium]], which can be seen when the cap is about 2&nbsp;mm in diameter.<ref name=Johnson1919/>[[File:Panellus stipticus 8445.jpg|thumb|left|The caps of young fruit bodies (top) are spherical, and grow epinastically, so that the developing gills remain enclosed until maturity.|alt=A group of about a half dozen overlapping light brownish-yellow mushroom caps clustered together on piece of rotting wood. Above the parger caps are several small mushrooms, the same color as the larger caps, but with round heads attached to relatively thick stems that in length are about one to three times the width of the cap.]]The young cap is spherical and its growth is at first [[wikt:epinastic|epinastic]], its margin being curved inwards and pressed against the stem. In this way, the hymenium begins its development within a special enclosed chamber. As the hymenial surface increases and keeps pace with the growth of the dorsal tissue of the cap, the latter expands and exposes the gills. The gills are formed by the continual downward growth of some of the hyphae. The gills are exposed before the cap is completely developed, and before the spores are mature. Spores can be produced by fruit bodies as small as {{convert|1.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad, and liberation of the spores continues until the fruit body is fully grown\u2014a period of one month to three months, depending on the conditions of temperature and moisture. The mature spores are disseminated by the wind. When the fruit body is nearing maturity, some of the terminal portions of the hyphae of the dorsal surface of the cap separate, and as a consequence, the upper surface of the fruit body becomes granular in appearance.<ref name=Johnson1919/>\n\nThe fruit body projects out horizontally from the growing surface. If the position of a log is altered after young fruit bodies with the beginnings of gills have appeared, the stems of these attempt to readjust themselves in order to place the cap in a horizontal position. The cap are sometimes [[wikt:zonate|zonate]] (marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones); this depends on changes in the [[humidity]] of the environment, as variations in the amount of moisture will cause alternating periods of acceleration or slowing of growth.<ref name=Johnson1919/>\n\nA yellowish-brown pigment is diffused through the [[cytosol]] of the hyphae and is much deeper in color just below the [[pileipellis|cuticle]] of the cap. In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale [[buff (color)|buff]], but soon the color of the cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on light, for when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.<ref name=Johnson1919/>\n\n==Distribution, habitat, and ecology==\n[[File:Panellus stipticus 34244.jpg|thumb|right|Fruit bodies can grow in dense overlapping clusters.|alt=A long clustered row showing the undersides of an orangeish-brown fan-shaped fungus.]]\n''Panellus stipticus'' is common in northern [[temperate]] regions of Europe, and has also been collected in Australia,<ref name=Fuhrer1985/> New Zealand,<ref name=Segedin1987/> [[Anatolia]],<ref name=Dennis1990/> Japan,<ref name=Petersen1992b/> and China.<ref name=Zhishu1993/> In North America, it is more common in the east than the west;<ref name=MushroomExpert/><ref name=Dickinson1982/> the mushroom's northern range extends to Alaska, and it has been collected as far south as [[Costa Rica]].<ref name=Jin2001/>\n\n''Panellus stipticus'' is a [[saprobic]] species, and causes a white rot.<ref name=Miller1970/> This is a form of wood decay in which the wood assumes a bleached appearance and where [[lignin]] as well as [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]] is broken down by [[enzyme]]s secreted by the fungus.

This [[phosphorescence]] was not observed in all specimens brought in for examination, and seemed to depend on some peculiar condition of the air, having been noticed only in specimens gathered in damp weather or just before a storm.<ref name=JBE1886/></blockquote>\nCanadian mycologist [[Arthur Henry Reginald Buller|Buller]] in 1924 described the gills of ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'' in North America as luminescent, and noted that the fungus glows most strongly at the time of spore maturation.<ref name=Buller1924/> Bioluminescence has not been observed in European specimens,<ref name=Macrae1942/> in Pacific North American collections, nor in strains collected from New Zealand, Russia, and Japan.<ref name=Petersen1992b/> Although a number of reports have confirmed that eastern North American strains are luminescent,<ref name=Petersen1992b/><ref name=Lingle1992/><ref name=Petersen1992a/><ref name=OKane1990a/><ref name=OKane1990b/> non-luminescent North American strains are also known.<ref name=Shimomura1992/> In general, the intensity of fungal bioluminescence decreases after exposure to certain contaminants; this sensitivity is being investigated as a means to develop bioluminescence-based [[biosensor]]s to test the toxicity of polluted soils.<ref name=Weitz2002/> Most known luminescent fungi are in the genus ''[[Mycena]]'' or closely allied genera; this grouping of fungi\u2014known as the \"mycenoid lineage\"\u2014includes ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'' and three other ''Panellus'' species.<ref name=Desjardin2008/>\n\n===Mycelia===\nThe [[mycelia]] of this species, grown in [[in vitro|laboratory culture]], have also been shown to be bioluminescent.<ref name=Bermudes1990/> Early studies demonstrated that short-wave [[ultraviolet]] light (at a [[wavelength]] of 280&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]) reversibly inhibited the luminescence of ''P.&nbsp;stypticus'' mycelia, while longer wavelength (366&nbsp;nm) ultraviolet was stimulatory.<ref name=Airth1960/><ref name=Berliner1962/> Further, the fungus exhibited a pronounced diurnal periodicity, and maximum luminescence was noted between 6 and 9 pm, regardless as to whether the mycelial cultures were incubated in continuous light, continuous darkness, or a normal day-night cycle.<ref name=Berliner1961/> The mycelia of ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'' grown submerged in liquid were non-luminescent, but became luminescent while growing on solid substrata. Dark-grown colonies were luminescent in the center, and light-grown colonies were brightest at the periphery.<ref name=Bermudes1990/> Other experiments have shown that growth temperature and [[pH]] have a significant effect on the level of bioluminescence, optimized at {{convert|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and pH 3\u20133.5. However, light had a significant effect on mycelial growth but not on bioluminescence, and the optimal light conditions for maximum bioluminescence were total darkness.<ref name=Weitz2001/>\n\n===Fruit bodies===\nBioluminescent tissue in the mature fruit body is restricted to the edge of the gills (as well as the cross-veins that connect them), the junction of the gills with the stem, and the inrolled cap edge. Distribution of bioluminescence along the gill edge corresponds to the position of the cheilocystidia. Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young and mature fruit bodies is from other tissues, including the fertile hymenial area and the stem. Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.<ref name=OKane1990b/>\n\n===Genetics===\n[[File:PanellusStipticusAug12 2009 Animated.gif|thumb|right|In [[Mount Vernon, Wisconsin]]|alt=A sequence of three pictures showing the effect of shining a light on a cluster of fan-shaped mushrooms growing on a log. When the lights hits the mushroom cluster, it glows green; when the light is moved away, the glow disappears.]]\n\nUsing techniques of [[complementation (genetics)|genetic complementation]], Macrae paired nonluminescent monocaryons with luminescent ones, and concluded that luminosity in ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'' is an inherited character, and governed by a single pair of [[allele]]s in which luminosity was [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] over nonluminosity. Luminosity factors were independent of intersterility factors. In 1992, Lingle and colleagues agreed with Macrae about luminosity and stated that at least three different [[mutation|gene mutations]] could lead to the loss of luminescence. They also reported that the maximum bioluminescence was found at 525&nbsp;nm, and shifted to 528&nbsp;nm in deeply pigmented fruit bodies.<ref name=Lingle1992/>\n\nAfter intercontinental compatibility tests, Petersen and Bermudes suggested that bioluminescence and compatibility were independent since bioluminescence seemed to be geographically restricted. This suggested that the ability or potential to interbreed must have been preserved since separation of ''P.&nbsp;stypticus'' into geographically isolated areas.<ref name=Petersen1992b/><ref name=Petersen1992a/>\n\n===Function===\nSeveral authors have suggested that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract [[arthropod]]s to the fruit body to help disseminate spores.<ref name=Ewart1906/><ref name=Lloyd1974/><ref name=Sivinski1981/> However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon.<ref name=OKane1990b/> In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. [[Basidiomycete]] mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development.<ref name=Alexopoous1996>{{cite book|vauthors=Alexopoulos CJ, Mims CW, Blackwell M| title=Introductory Mycology | year=1996 |page=  | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-0-471-52229-4}}</ref> In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.<ref name=Deheyn2007/>\n\n===Chemical basis===\n[[File:Panal.svg|right|thumb|The chemical structure of panal|alt=C15H18O5]]\nIn general, bioluminescence is caused by the action of [[luciferase]]s, enzymes that produce light by the [[oxidation]] of a [[luciferin]] (a [[pigment]]). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in ''Panellus stipticus'', and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the [[sesquiterpene]] panal, which has a [[cadinene]] keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-''O''-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-''O''-dodecanoylpanal).<ref name=Shimomura1993/> If these compounds are treated with salt of [[ammonia]] or [[primary amine]]s in the presence of [[iron(II)]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and a cationic [[surfactant]], light is emitted by a [[chemiluminescence]] reaction,<ref name=Nakamura1988/><ref name=Shimomura1989/> suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of ''[[in vivo]]'' bioluminescence.<ref name=Hanson2008/><ref name=Shimomura1991/> In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD) appears to play a critical role in the amount of light emission. SOD quenches the effect of the [[superoxide]] (O<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.<ref name=Shimomura1992/>\n\n==Bioremediation==\nAs a white-rot fungus, ''Panellus stipticus'' contains enzymes that are able to break down [[lignin]], a complex [[aromaticity|aromatic]] polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of [[aromatic hydrocarbon|hydrocarbon rings]] is [[laccase]], which [[enzyme catalysis|catalyzes]] the addition of a [[hydroxyl]] group to [[phenol]]ic compounds ([[polyphenol]]s). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the [[bioremediation]] of land contaminated by [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic pollutants]], and to convert [[industrial waste]]s rich in toxic polyphenols. ''Panellus stipticus'' has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants\u2014an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'' [[mycelia]] reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period.<ref name=Aggelis2002/> In a separate study, a ''P.&nbsp;stipticus'' culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-''p''-dioxin, a [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|polychlorinated dioxin]].<ref name=Sato2006/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of bioluminescent fungi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=Airth1960>{{cite journal |vauthors=Airth RL, Foerster GE |year=1960 |title=Some aspects of fungal bioluminescence |journal=Journal of Cellular and Comparative Physiology |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=173\u2013182 |doi=10.1002/jcp.1030560307 |pmid=13681827}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Aggelis2002>{{cite journal |vauthors=Aggelis G, Ehaliotis C, Nerud F, Stoychev I, Lyberatos G, Zervakis GI |title=Evaluation of white-rot fungi for detoxification and decolorization of effluents from the green olive debittering process |journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |volume=59 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=353\u201360 |doi=10.1007/s00253-002-1005-9 |pmid=12111170 |year=2002}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |authorlink=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=138 |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86tM01VsFG0C&pg=PA138}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Atwood1941>{{cite journal |author=Atwood EL. |year=1941 |title=White-tailed deer food of the United States |journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=314\u201332 |doi=10.2307/3795797 |jstor=3795797}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BanaresBaudet1982>{{cite journal |vauthors=Banares Baudet A, Beltran Tejera E |year=1982 |title=Additions to the Canary Islands Spain 2.

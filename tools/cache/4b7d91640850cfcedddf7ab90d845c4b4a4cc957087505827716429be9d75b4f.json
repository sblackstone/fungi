It produces [[mushroom]]s with pinkish-cinnamon [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|11|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide held by pinkish-white [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.  When it is cut or injured, the mushroom oozes a white [[latex]] that rapidly turns bright sulfur-yellow. The species is found on the west coast of the United States and grows in the ground in association with [[hardwood]] and [[conifer]] trees. There are several other ''Lactarius'' species that bear resemblance to ''L.&nbsp;xanthogalactus'', but most can be distinguished by differences in [[staining]] reactions, macroscopic characteristics, or habitat.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1907.<ref name=\"Peck 1907\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''xanthogalactus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] words meaning \"yellow\" and \"milk\".\n\n==Similar species==\n[[File:Lactarius chrysorrheus 041120w.jpg|thumb|160px|right|''Lactarius chrysorrheus'' also produces yellow latex.]]\n''[[Lactarius vinaceorufescens]]'' has nearly identical microscopic features to ''L.&nbsp;xanthogalactus'', but macroscopically it has reddish-vinaceous stains that develop on the cap, gills, and stem.  Another lookalike is ''[[Lactarius colorascens|L.&nbsp;colorascens]]'', but it may be distinguished from ''L.&nbsp;xanthogalactus'' by several features: a smaller fruit body; a whitish cap that becomes brownish-red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown; bitter to faintly acrid latex; and slightly smaller spores. ''[[Lactarius chrysorrheus|L.&nbsp;chrysorrheus]]'' is also similar, but it has a whitish to pale yellowish-cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods (especially oak) on well-drained, often sandy soil, and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown.<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\nOther superficially similar species include ''[[Lactarius rubrilacteus|L.&nbsp;rubrilacteus]]'', ''[[Lactarius rufus|L.&nbsp;rufus]]'', ''[[Lactarius subviscidus|L.&nbsp;subviscidus]]'', ''[[Lactarius fragilis|L.&nbsp;fragilis]]'' and ''[[Lactarius rufulus|L.&nbsp;rufulus]]'', but none of these species have the yellow staining reaction characteristic of ''L.&nbsp;xanthogalactus''.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nThe fruit bodies of ''Lactarius xanthogalactus'' grow scattered or in groups on the ground under [[conifers]] and [[hardwoods]] between August and January in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=74 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette AR, Bessette A, Harris DM |title=Milk Mushrooms of North America: A Field Guide to the Genus ''Lactarius'' |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse |year=2009 |pages=263\u201364 |isbn=0-8156-3229-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Peck 1907\">{{cite journal |author=Peck CH. |title=New species of fungi |journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club |year=1907 |volume=34 |pages=345\u2013349}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IndexFungorum|196072}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q10315470}}\n\n[[Category:Lactarius|xanthogalactus]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1907]]\n[[Category:Fungi of the United States]]\n[[Category:Poisonous fungi]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Charles Horton Peck]]"}]}}}}

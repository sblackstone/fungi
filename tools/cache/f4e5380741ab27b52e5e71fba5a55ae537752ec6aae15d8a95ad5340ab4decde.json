Formally described in 1912, it was for a long time considered the same species as the similar ''[[Lepiota cristata]]'' until [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis reported in 2001 demonstrated that it was genetically distinct. It is most common in coastal and northern [[California]], and has also been recorded in Mexico. A [[saprobic]] species, it is usually found under [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] and [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey cypress]]. Its [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) have white [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] with an orange-red to orange-brown center that measure up to {{convert|3.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The cream-colored to light pink [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] are up to {{convert|6.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.2|\u2013|0.6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and have a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'' can be distinguished from other similar ''[[Lepiota]]'' species by differences in habitat, macroscopic, or microscopic characteristics.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] as new to science by mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1912. Murrill collected the [[type (biology)|type]] material growing near redwoods near [[Searsville Lake]], [[California]], in December 1911.<ref name=\"Murrill 1912\"/> In 1914,<ref name=\"Murrill 1914\"/> Murrill decided that the species was the same as ''[[Lepiota cristata]]'' (which he called ''Lepiota conspurcata'' (Willd.) Morgan); this opinion was later corroborated by Walter Sundberg in 1989 after he studied the type collection and concluded that the microscopic characteristics of both were the same.<ref name=\"Sundberg 1989\"/> Using [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis based on comparing [[DNA sequence]]s of the [[internal transcribed spacer]] region, mycologist Else Vellinga determined that despite the lack of distinguishing [[morphology (biology)|micro-morphological]] characteristics, the two species were distinct.<ref name=\"Vellinga 2001\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|epithet]] ''castaneidisca'' refers to the chestnut-colored center of the cap. ''Lepiota'' means \"the scaly one\".<ref name=\"Vellinga 2007\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lepiota castaneidisca younger.JPG|thumb|left|A young fruit body]]\n[[File:Lepiota_castaneidisca_spores.JPG|thumb|Spores 1000x]]\nThe [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''Lepiota castaneidisca'' have white, bell-shaped to convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s {{convert|0.8|to|3.2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, with an orange-reddish to pale orange-brown center. Mature specimens fade and lose the reddish shades. The cap surface develops small pale pink or cream patches (especially on the outermost zone) on a white background that has radially arranged [[wikt:fibril|fibrils]].<ref name=\"Vellinga 2001\"/> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are somewhat crowded to moderately distant,<ref name=\"Vellinga 2007\"/> with typically 40\u201345 full length gills, and 1\u20135 tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). They are slightly [[ventricose]], measuring 2.5\u20135&nbsp;mm wide, and have a white fringed or irregular edge.<ref name=\"Vellinga 2001\"/> Whitish when young and cream-colored in age, they have a free gill attachment to the stem.  The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|25|\u2013|65|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2|\u2013|6|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, slightly widened at the base, hollow, and [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]]. Its color is pinkish in the lower part, and it stains reddish where damaged, especially in older specimens.<ref name=\"Vellinga 2007\"/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, sometimes with cream tones, or reddish-brown in mature specimens.<ref name=\"Vellinga 2001\"/> There is a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] that points upward in young specimens, but in maturity it degrades to remnants that are left behind on the stem. It has a sharp odor similar to [[rubber]] or [[cod liver oil]].<ref name=\"Vellinga 2007\"/>  The mushroom is not known to be [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], but consumption is not recommended due to the risk of possible confusion with ''[[Lepiota]]'' species that contain deadly [[amatoxin]]s.<ref name=\"MykoWeb\"/>\n\nThe smooth, [[dextrinoid]] [[spore]]s are in side view triangular with a spurred base, in frontal view oblong, and typically measure 5\u20139 by 3\u20134&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=\"Vellinga 2001\"/> [[Staining]] with Cresyl blue shows them to be somewhat [[Metachromasy|metachromatic]], and [[Cell nucleus|binucleate]].<ref name=\"Vellinga 2010\"/> [[Cystidia]] on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are club-shaped to cylindric or sometimes spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem), and have dimensions of 20\u201344 by 6.5\u201313.5&nbsp;\u03bcm. [[Basidia]] are 18\u201330 by 5\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]], mostly four-spored, and are absent on the gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The [[cap cuticle]] is a hymeniderm (lengthened cells arranged side by side) with mostly colorless elements of different lengths, measuring 16\u201362 by 8\u201318&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=\"Vellinga 2007\"/> The stipitipellis (outer covering of the stem) comprises a layer of colorless [[hypha]]e measuring about 2\u20133&nbsp;\u03bcm wide. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of all parts of the fungus.<ref name=\"Vellinga 2001\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Lepiota cristata 20070819w.jpg|thumb|right|''Lepiota cristata'' is a lookalike species.]]\n''Lepiota castaneidisca'' closely resembles ''L.&nbsp;cristata'' (with which it has commonly been confused),<ref name=\"MykoWeb\"/> but it has a more rounded cap, lacks an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], and is reddish- or pinkish-brown, rather than orange-brown.<ref name=\"Vellinga 2001\"/> ''L.&nbsp;cristata'', which is widely distributed in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], prefers habitats where the natural vegetational cover has been disturbed by humans, or in the beds of rivers and creeks; in contrast, ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'' is found in natural, undisturbed habitats.<ref name=\"Vellinga 2007\"/> Other similar species in similar habitats with which ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'' could be confused include ''[[Lepiota thiersii|L.&nbsp;thiersii]]'' and ''[[Lepiota neophana|L.&nbsp;neophana]]''; in contrast to ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'', both of the latter two species have ellipsoid spores.<ref name=\"Vellinga 2001\"/> The fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;thiersii'' appear from November through April, and grow scattered or in groups under [[Cupressus macrocarpa|cypress]]. It usually lacks the reddish color in the center of the cap associated with ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'', and its spores are not as long, with dimensions of 4.7\u20136.3 by 3.1\u20133.9&nbsp;\u03bcm. ''L.&nbsp;neophana'' is a rare species, but more widely distributed in the United States than ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'', as it has been reported from [[Ohio]] and [[Michigan]] in addition to California. It also fruits under cypress, usually between December and April. This mushroom is most readily distinguished from ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'' by the dark brown to blackish-brown color of the cap center.<ref name=\"Sundberg 1989\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\n''Lepiota castaneidisca'' is a [[saprobic]] fungus.<ref name=\"Vellinga 2001\"/> Fruit bodies appear in the late fall and winter (November to February), where they grow gregariously near cypress, [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] or in mixed  [[Quercus agrifolia|coast live oak]] forests. The fungus is common in coastal and northern [[California]], and is often found in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name=\"Vellinga 2007\"/> The northern limit of its distribution is [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]<ref name=\"Vellinga 2010\"/> and southern [[British Columbia]], and it has been recorded as far south as Mexico.<ref name=\"Aroche 1984\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n* [[List of Lepiota species|List of ''Lepiota'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Aroche 1984\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Aroche RM, Cifuentes J, Lorea F, Fuentes P, Bonavides J, Garc\u00eda H, Menendez E, Aguilar O, Valenzuela V |title=Macromicetos t\u00f3xicos y comestibles de una regi\u00f3n comunal del Valle de M\u00e9xico |trans-title=Toxic and edible mushrooms in a community of the valley of Mexico 1 |journal=Boletin de la Sociedad Mexicana de Micologia |year=1984 |issue=19 |pages=291\u2013318 |issn=0085-6223 |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Murrill 1912\">{{cite journal |author=Murrill WA. |title=The Agaricaceae of the Pacific Coast \u2013 II.

It is straw or honey coloured and in Britain grows in beech woods during autumn. It is inedible.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIt was first described and named in 1821 by the Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]], initially as ''Agaricus felleus'', before being placed in the genus ''Russula'' in 1838. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] adjective ''felleus'' meaning \"biliary\", in reference to its bitter taste, reminiscent of [[bile]].\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is usually 4\u20139&nbsp;cm wide, and convex, flattening later, and often with a broad central boss ([[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]]). It is sometimes furrowed at the margin when mature. The similarly coloured, but paler [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is firm and stout, and is 2\u20136&nbsp;cm high by 1\u20132&nbsp;cm wide. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed, and are the same colour as the stem, giving a [[spore print]] that is white to pale cream. The flesh is white, and does not change colour on cutting. It tastes hot,<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page=42}}</ref> and often has a bitter tang.

It is normally associated with well-drained acid soils, and is widespread in the northern [[temperateness|temperate]] zones; [[Great Britain|Britain]]; [[Europe]], and [[Asia]]. It is not present in [[North America]] where it is replaced by the closely related ''[[Russula simillima|R.simillima]]''.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Thomas Laessoe | year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref> It grows in [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] woods, and forests.\n\n==Edibility==\nThis mushroom is inedible, having a very hot bitter taste.<ref name=Phillips06/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Russula species|List of ''Russula'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons|Russula fellea}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q775406}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Inedible fungi]]\n[[Category:Russula|fellea]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]"}]}}}}

It lives on chalky soils with [[beech]] trees, and appears earlier than most mushrooms of similar size in southern [[England]]. It frequently occurs singly or in small groups, resulting in it being referred to as the '''solitary amanita''' or, more specifically, '''European solitary lepidella'''. It is very drought-tolerant. ''Amanita solitaria'' is a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] and opinions are divided as to which name takes precedence.\n[[Image:Am.echin(2).jpg|right|thumb|Both of the images featured depict the same fruiting body. Note the pyramidal warts on the button.]]\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIt was first described as ''Agaricus echinocephalus'' in 1835 by the Italian [[mycologist]] [[Carlo Vittadini]], before being placed in ''[[Amanita]]'' by [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] and hence receiving its current [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]]. It derives its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''echinocephala'' from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''echino-'' \"hedgehog\" and ''kephale'' \"head\".<ref name=Liddell1980>{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn =0-19-910207-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms & Toadstools in colour |last=Seymour |first=Jacqueline|year=1978 |publisher=Stafford Pemberton Publishing |location=Crows Nest, NSW |isbn=0-904681-43-2 |page=36 }}</ref> It has been placed in the ''Lepidella'' section of the Amanitaceae by some authors, because of its lack of a well formed volva. ''Amanita solitaria'' ([[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Bull.]]:[[Elias Magnus Fries|Fr.]]) Fr. is considered a synonym here but according to many modern authors (subject specialists in ''Amanita'', e.g., C.&nbsp;Bas or R.E.&nbsp;Tulloss) it is a valid name for this species.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] can be up to {{convert|15|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter, and is white to ivory, or silver-grey in colour. It is covered in raised pyramidal warts, that become less well defined, and less frequent towards the margin. These are remnants of the [[universal veil]] which covers the mushroom in its earliest stages. The young buttons are darker, and sometimes shaped like a two tier loaf, with a ring of raised scales around the base. The white to ivory [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|8|\u2013|16|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, with several rings of upturned scales towards the bulbous base. It is fairly deeply rooted, often laterally below the surface. The [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] is thin and fragile, often adhering to the stipe. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are cream, but sometimes have a slight green tint.<ref name=C&D1995>{{cite book| author = Regis Courtecuisse and Bernard Duhem |edition=British | year =1995 | title = Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and Europe | publisher = Harper Collins | isbn = 0-00-220025-2}}</ref> \nThey are largely free of the stipe, but sometimes have a small decurrent tooth.

It is a more robust mushroom, with large thick; but flat patches on the cap, and typically has noticeable hanging veil remnants around the cap margin. With a delicate mealy ring.<ref name=Phillips06/>\n* '''''[[Amanita vittadinii]]''''' '''(Moretti) Vittadini''' has conical warts on the cap, and has recurved scales right to the underside of the ring. It is usually found on heavier soils.<ref name=C&D1995/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Amanita echinocephala'' occurs in Britain, Europe, [[Western Asia]], and [[North Africa]]. It appears in Britain during summer, and early autumn. It grows in light, dry [[calcareous]] soils with both broad leaved, (usually beech [[Beech|Fagus]]) and [[Pinophyta|coniferous trees]]. It is quite drought-tolerant, giving rise to the suspicion that Southern England could be at the northern extent of its range. It occurs with [[hardwood]]s on calcareous soils, often associated with Limes (''[[Tilia]]'') in the Czech Republic, sometimes together with ''A.&nbsp;strobiliformis''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Borovicka |first=J |year=2006|title=Notes on ''Amanita strobiliformis'' and related species of the section ''Lepidella''. |journal=Mykol.

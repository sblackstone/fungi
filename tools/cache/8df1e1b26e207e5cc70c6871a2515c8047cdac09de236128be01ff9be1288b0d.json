The pecan truffle is so named because it is most commonly found in [[pecan]] orchards, in association with the pecan tree, however the pecan is not its only symbiote. Formerly considered nothing more than a nuisance by pecan farmers, the pecan truffle has been gaining in popularity as an [[edible mushroom]] in recent years and can fetch over $160 per pound at market.<ref name=\"pecanmag\">{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=M.E.|display-authors=etal|title=Pecan Truffles ( ''Tuber lyonii'' )  What We Know and What We Need to Know|journal=Georgia Pecan Magazine|date=2012|issue=Spring 2012|pages=52\u201358}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe fruit body has a light brown outer skin ([[peridium]]) that can be rounded, have \u201clobes,\u201d and may be furrowed or smooth. When the mature truffles are cut in half, they have a marbled interior with white sterile veins layered between brown veins where the spores are produced. It usually rests in the top few inches of soil, sometimes poking up through the soil so that it is exposed and becomes dried out or attacked by insects.<ref name=\"pecanmag\" />\n\n==Ecology and Distribution==\nThe range of the pecan truffle extends from the northern Mexico states of Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas into Qu\u00e9bec, Canada and from the eastern seaboard out to the southern reaches of the Rocky Mountains. It is most commonly reported in association with ''[[Carya]]'' (hickories and pecans) and ''[[Quercus]]'' (oaks, the most receptive of ''Tuber'' symbiotes). However, it has occasionally been discovered in association with ''[[Corylus]]'' (hazels) and ''[[Castanea (plant)|Castanea]]'' (chestnuts), and even [[Basswood]] trees.<ref name=\"EOL\" /> One particularly productive habitat where ''T. lyonii'' has been found is in well-managed pecan orchards, particularly along the edge of herbicide strips. This is likely due to the raised pH of the soil, which is usually around 7 or 7.5 for pecan production.\n\nFruiting bodies seem to be produced most prolifically on young trees, and fruits towards the end of summer and into fall depending on the specific local climate. In the southernmost part of its range through [[Florida]] and southern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], fruiting may continue through the winter and as late as February.<ref name=\"IFAS\">{{cite web|last1=Grupe II|display-authors=etal|first1=Arthur C.|title=The Pecan Truffle ( Tuber lyonii ): A Gourmet Truffle  Native to the Southeastern United States|url=https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PP/PP33000.pdf|publisher=Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension, University of Florida|accessdate=20 March 2017}}</ref> The fruiting bodies can reach up to 12 centimeters across at maturity, though most fall between 0.5 and 2 centimeters.<ref name=EOL />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q29887657}}\n\n[[Category:Truffles (fungi)]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1903]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Canada]]\n[[Category:Fungi of the United States]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Tuber (fungus)]]"}]}}}}

It is commonly known as the '''eastern North American destroying angel''' or just as the '''destroying angel''', although the fungus shares this latter name with three other lethal white ''[[Amanita]]'' species, ''[[Amanita ocreata|A.&nbsp;ocreata]]'', ''[[Amanita verna|A.&nbsp;verna]]'' and ''[[Amanita virosa|A.&nbsp;virosa]]''. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are found on the ground in [[mixed coniferous]] and [[deciduous forest]]s of eastern North America south to Mexico, but are rare in western North America; the fungus has also been found in pine plantations in [[Colombia]]. The mushroom has a smooth white [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that can reach up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} across, and a [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], up to {{convert|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1.8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, that has a delicate white skirt-like [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] near the top. The bulbous stipe base is covered with a membranous sac-like [[volva (mycology)|volva]]. The white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] and crowded closely together. As the [[specific name (botany)|species name]] suggests, ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'' typically bears two [[spore]]s on the [[basidia]], although this characteristic is not as immutable as was once thought.\n\n''Amanita bisporigera'' was [[species description|described]] as a new species in 1906. It is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Phalloideae'' of the genus ''Amanita'' together with other [[amatoxin]]-containing species. Amatoxins are [[cyclic peptide]]s which [[enzyme inhibition|inhibit]] the enzyme [[RNA polymerase II]] and interfere with various cellular functions. The first symptoms of poisoning appear 6 to 24 hours after consumption, followed by a period of apparent improvement, then by symptoms of [[acute liver failure|liver]] and [[acute kidney injury|kidney failure]], and death after four days or more. ''Amanita bisporigera'' closely resembles a few other white amanitas, including the equally deadly ''A.&nbsp;virosa'' and ''A.&nbsp;verna''. These species, difficult to distinguish from ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'' based on visible field characteristics, do not have two-spored [[basidia]], and do not stain yellow when a dilute solution of [[potassium hydroxide]] is applied. The [[DNA]] of ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'' has been partially [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]], and the [[gene]]s responsible for the production of amatoxins have been determined.\n\n==Taxonomy, classification, and phylogeny==\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n| clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n| label1=\n| 1={{clade\n     |1={{clade\n          |1={{clade\n               |1={{clade\n                    |1={{clade\n                        |1={{clade\n                             |1=''[[Amanita exitialis|A. exitialis]]''\n                             |2=''[[Amanita subjunquillea|A. subjunquillea]]'' var.

Lewis. The [[type locality (biology)|type locality]] was [[Ithaca, New York]], where several collections were made.<ref name=Lewis1906/> In his 1941 [[monograph]] of world ''Amanita'' species, [[\u00c9douard-Jean Gilbert]] transferred the species to his new genus ''Amanitina'',<ref name=Gilbert1941/> but this genus is now considered [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''Amanita''.<ref name=Kirk2008/> In 1944, [[William Murrill]] described the species ''Amanita vernella'', collected from [[Gainesville, Florida]];<ref name=Murrill1944/> that species is now thought to be synonymous with ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'' after a 1979 examination of its type material revealed [[basidium|basidia]] that were mostly 2-spored.<ref name=\"urlAmanita Key\"/><ref name=Jenkins1979/> ''Amanita phalloides'' var. ''striatula'', a poorly known taxon originally described from the United States in 1902 by [[Charles Horton Peck]],<ref name=Peck1902/> is considered by ''Amanita'' authority Rodham Tulloss to be synonymous with ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera''.<ref name=\"urlAmanita Key\"/> [[Common name|Vernacular names]] for the mushroom include \"destroying angel\", \"deadly amanita\", \"white death cap\", \"angel of death\"<ref name=Ammirati1985/> and \"eastern North American destroying angel\".<ref name=\"urlTulloss2009\"/>\n\n''Amanita bisporigera'' belongs to [[section (biology)|section]] ''Phalloideae'' of the genus ''Amanita'', which contains some of the deadliest ''Amanita'' species, including ''A.&nbsp;phalloides'' and ''A.&nbsp;virosa''. This [[classification (biology)|classification]] has been upheld with [[phylogenetic]] analyses, which demonstrate that the toxin-producing members of section ''Phalloideae'' form a [[clade]]\u2014that is, they derive from a common ancestor.<ref name=Weiss1998/><ref name=Drehmel1999/> In 2005, Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the [[internal transcribed spacer]] (ITS) sequences of several white-bodied toxic ''Amanita'' species, most of which are found in Asia. Their results support a clade containing ''A. bisporigera'', ''A.&nbsp;subjunquillea'' var. ''alba'', ''A.&nbsp;exitialis'', and ''A.&nbsp;virosa''. The Guangzhou destroying angel (''Amanita exitialis'') has two-spored basidia, like ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera''.<ref name=Zhang2005/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Amanita bisporigera 49421.jpg|thumb|left|The white gills are crowded closely together, and the stipe base is bulbous.]]\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|3|\u2013|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and, depending on its age, ranges in shape from egg-shaped to convex to somewhat flattened. The cap surface is smooth and white, sometimes with a pale tan- or cream-colored tint in the center. The surface is either dry or, when the environment is moist, slightly sticky. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and white, and does not change color when bruised.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> The margin of the cap, which is rolled inwards in young specimens, does not have striations (grooves), and lacks [[volva (mycology)|volval]] remnants. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]], also white, are crowded closely together. They are either free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] or just barely reach it. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend all the way to the stipe) are numerous, and gradually narrow.\n\n[[File:Amanita bisporigera 55964 crop.jpg|thumb|150px|Surfaces turn yellow when stained with potassium hydroxide solution.]]The white stipe is {{convert|6|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|0.7|\u2013|1.8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, solid (i.e., not hollow), and tapers slightly upward. The surface, in young specimens especially, is frequently floccose (covered with tufts of soft hair), fibrillose (covered with small slender fibers), or squamulose (covered with small scales); there may be fine grooves along its length. The bulb at the base of the stipe is spherical or nearly so. The delicate [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the upper part of the stipe is a remnant of the [[partial veil]] that extends from the cap margin to the stalk and covers the gills during development. It is white, thin, membranous, and hangs like a skirt. When young, the mushrooms are enveloped in a membrane called the [[universal veil]], which stretches from the top of the cap to the bottom of the stipe, imparting an oval, egg-like appearance. In mature fruit bodies, the veil's remnants form a membrane around the base, the volva, like an eggshell-shaped cup. On occasion, however, the volva remains underground or gets torn up during development. It is white, sometimes lobed, and may become pressed closely to the stipe.<ref name=\"Jenkins140-41\">Jenkins, 1986, pp. 140\u201341.</ref> The volva is up to {{convert|3.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} in height (measured from the base of the bulb), and is about 2&nbsp;mm thick midway between the top and the base attachment.<ref name=\"urlTulloss2009\"/> The mushroom's odor has been described as \"pleasant to somewhat nauseous\",<ref name=Ammirati1985/> becoming more [[wikt:cloying|cloying]] as the fruit body ages.<ref name=\"urlTulloss2009\"/> The cap flesh turns yellow when a solution of [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification#Potassium hydroxide|potassium hydroxide]] (KOH, 5\u201310%) is applied (a common [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification#Potassium hydroxide|chemical test]] used in mushroom identification). This characteristic chemical reaction is shared with ''A.&nbsp;ocreata'' and ''A.&nbsp;virosa'', although some authors have expressed doubt about the identity of North American ''A.&nbsp;virosa'', suggesting those collections may represent four-spored ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera''.<ref name=\"urlTulloss2009\"/><ref name=\"urlKuo2003\"/> Tulloss suggests that reports of ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'' that do not turn yellow with KOH were actually based on white forms of ''[[Amanita phalloides|A.&nbsp;phalloides]]''.<ref name=\"urlTulloss2009\"/> Findings from the [[Chiricahua Mountains]] of [[Arizona]] and in central Mexico, although \"nearly identical\" to ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'', do not stain yellow with KOH; their taxonomic status has not been investigated in detail.<ref name=\"urlAmanita Key\"/>\n\n===Microscopic features===\n[[File:Amanita bisporigera 59865.jpg|thumb|left|Spores are roughly spherical and translucent]]The [[spore print]] of ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'', like most ''Amanita'', is white. The [[spore]]s are roughly spherical, thin-walled, [[hyaline]] (translucent), [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and measure 7.8\u20139.6 by 7.0\u20139.0 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[Pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of partially gelatinized, filamentous interwoven [[hypha]]e, 2\u20136&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. The tissue of the gill is bilateral, meaning it diverges from the center of the gill to its outer edge. The subhymenium is ramose\u2014composed of relatively thin branching, unclamped hyphae. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are club-shaped, thin-walled, without clamps, with dimensions of 34\u201345 by 4\u201311&nbsp;\u03bcm. They are typically two-spored, although rarely three- or four-spored forms have been found.<ref name=\"Jenkins140-41\"/> Although the two-spored basidia are a defining characteristic of the species, there is evidence of a tendency to shift towards producing four-spored basidia as the fruiting season progresses.<ref name=\"urlTulloss2009\"/> The volva is composed almost exclusively of densely interwoven filamentous hyphae, 2\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter, that are sparsely to moderately branched. There are few small inflated cells, which are mostly spherical to broadly elliptic. The tissue of the stipe is made of abundant, sparsely branched, filamentous hyphae, without clamps, measuring 2\u20135&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. The inflated cells are club-shaped, longitudinally oriented, and up to 2\u20133 by 15.7&nbsp;\u03bcm. The annulus is made of abundant moderately branched filamentous hyphae, measuring 2\u20136&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. The inflated cells are sparse, broadly elliptic to pear-shaped, and are rarely larger than 31 by 22&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=\"Jenkins140-41\"/> [[wikt:Pleurocystidium|Pleurocystidia]] and [[wikt:cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] ([[cystidia]] found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent, but there may be cylindrical to sac-like cells of the partial veil on the gill edges; these cells are hyaline and measure 24\u201334 by 7\u201316&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>\n[[File:Amanita bisporigera basidia.jpg|thumb|right|Development of basidia, as illustrated by Lewis in 1906<ref name=Lewis1906/>]]In 1906 Charles E. Lewis studied and illustrated the development of the basidia in order to compare the [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] behavior of the two-spored with that of the four-spored forms. Initially (1), the young basidium, appearing as a club-shaped branch from the subhymenium, is filled with [[cytoplasm]] and contains two primary nuclei, which have distinct [[nucleolus|nucleoli]]. As the basidium grows larger, the membranes of the two nuclei contact (2), and then the membrane disappears at the point of contact (3). The two primary nuclei remain distinct for a short time, but eventually the two nuclei fuse completely to form a larger secondary nucleus with a single secondary nucleolus (4, 5). The basidium increases in size after the primary nuclei fuse, and the nucleus migrates towards the end of the basidia (6, 7). During this time, the nucleus develops [[vacuole]]s \"filled by the nuclear sap in the living cell\". [[Chromosome]]s are produced from the nucleolar threads, and align transversely near the apex of the basidium, connected by [[spindle apparatus|spindles]] (8\u201310). The chromosomes then move to the poles, forming the daughter nuclei that occupy different positions in the basidium; the daughters now have a structure similar to that of the parent nuclei (11). The two nuclei then divide to form four nuclei, similar to fungi with four-spored basidia (12, 13). The four nuclei crowd together at some distance from the end of the basidium to form an irregular mass (14). Shortly thereafter, the sterigmata (slender projections of the basidia that attach the spores) begin to form (15), and cytoplasm begins to pass through the sterigmata to form the spores (16). Although Lewis was not able to clearly determine from observation alone whether the contents of two or four nuclei passed through the sterigmata, he deduced, by examining older basidia with mature spores, that only two nuclei enter the spores (16, 17).<ref name=Lewis1906/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n[[File:Alpha-amanitin structure.png|thumb|left|\u03b1-amanitin, principal toxic component of ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'']]\n''Amanita bisporigera'' is considered the most toxic North American ''Amanita'' mushroom, with little variation in toxin content between different fruit bodies.<ref name=Tyler1966/><ref name=Dart2003/> Three subtypes of amatoxin have been described: [[alpha-Amanitin|\u03b1-]], [[beta-Amanitin|\u03b2]], and [[Gamma-Amanitin|\u03b3-amanitin]]. The principal amatoxin, \u03b1-amanitin, is readily absorbed across the intestine, and 60% of the absorbed toxin is excreted into [[bile]] and undergoes [[enterohepatic circulation]]; the kidneys clear the remaining 40%. The toxin [[enzyme inhibition|inhibits]] the enzyme [[RNA polymerase II]], thereby interfering with [[DNA transcription]], which suppresses RNA production and [[protein synthesis]]. This causes cellular [[necrosis]], especially in cells which are initially exposed and have rapid rates of protein synthesis. This process results in severe acute liver dysfunction and, ultimately, [[liver failure]].<ref name=Madhok2006/> Amatoxins are not broken down by boiling, freezing, or drying.<ref name=Benjamin1995/><ref name=Hall2003/> Roughly 0.2 to 0.4&nbsp;[[milligram]]s of \u03b1-amanitin is present in 1&nbsp;gram of ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera''; the [[lethal dose]] in humans is less than 0.1&nbsp;mg/kg body weight.<ref name=Madhok2006/> One mature fruit body can contain 10\u201312&nbsp;mg of \u03b1-amanitin, enough for a lethal dose.<ref name=Hallen2007/> The \u03b1-amanitin concentration in the spores is about 17% that of the fruit body tissues.<ref name=McKnight2010/>  ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'' also contains the [[phallotoxin]] phallacidin, structurally related to the amatoxins but considered less poisonous because of poor absorption.<ref name=Hallen2007/> Poisonings (from similar white amanitas) have also been reported in domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and cows.<ref name=Tu1992/>\n\nThe first reported poisonings resulting in death from the consumption of ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'' were from near [[San Antonio (disambiguation)|San Antonio]], Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three children consumed the fungus; only the man survived.<ref name=Helm1957/> ''Amanita'' poisoning is characterized by the following distinct stages:<ref name=Fineschi1996/> the ''incubation stage'' is an [[asymptomatic]] period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In the ''gastrointestinal stage'', about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe [[electrolyte]] imbalances, and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as [[phalloidin]]. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as [[jaundice]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[acidosis]], and [[hemorrhage]] appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of [[prothrombin]] and blood levels of [[ammonia]], and the signs of [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and/or [[kidney failure]] appear. The [[risk factor]]s for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe [[coagulopathy]] (blood clotting disorder), severe [[hyperbilirubinemia]] (jaundice), and rising serum [[creatinine]] levels.<ref name=Madhok2006/>\n\n==Similar species==\nThe color and general appearance of ''A.&nbsp;bisporigera'' are similar to those of ''[[Amanita verna|A.&nbsp;verna]]'' and ''[[Amanita virosa|A.&nbsp;virosa]]''.

Although few ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been tested in this way, the authors suggest that the absence of plant cell wall-degrading ability may correlate with the ectomycorrhizal ecological niche.<ref name=Nagendran2009/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n*[[List of deadly fungi]]\n*[[Silibinin]] \u2013 a liver-protecting compound used in cases of ''Amanita'' mushroom poisoning\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Adams2006>{{cite journal|vauthors=Adams RI, Hallen HE, Pringle A |year=2006 |title=Primer note: Using the incomplete genome of the ectomycorrhizal fungus ''Amanita bisporigera'' to identify molecular polymorphisms in the related ''Amanita phalloides'' |journal=Molecular Ecology Notes |volume=6 |pages=218\u2013220 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-8286.2005.01198.x |url=http://www.msu.edu/user/hallenhe/Adams, |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919212514/http://www.msu.edu/user/hallenhe/Adams%2C%20Hallen%2C%20Pringle%20paper.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-19 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ammirati1985>{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati JF, Traquair JA, Horgen PA |title=Poisonous Mushrooms of Canada: Including other Inedible Fungi |publisher=Fitzhenry & Whiteside in cooperation with Agriculture Canada and the Canadian Government Publishing Centre, Supply and Services Canada |location=Markham, Ontario |year=1985 |pages=85\u201387 |isbn=978-0-88902-977-4}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ammirati2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati J, Trudell S |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest: Timber Press Field Guide (Timber Press Field Guides) |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2009 |page=80 |isbn=978-0-88192-935-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC&pg=PA80}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Benjamin1995>{{cite book |author=Benjamin DR |title=Mushrooms, Poisons and Panaceas.

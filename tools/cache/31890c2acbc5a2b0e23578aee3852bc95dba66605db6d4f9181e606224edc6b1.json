The genus has been segregated from ''[[Volvariella]]'' with which it shares some [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics such as the presence of a [[volva (mycology)|volva]] and a pink to pink-brown [[spore print]].<ref name=Justo2011/> [[Molecular phylogenetics|Phylogenetic analyses of DNA data]] have shown that ''Volvopluteus'' is closely related to ''[[Pluteus]]'' and both genera currently are classified in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Pluteaceae]], while ''Volvariella'' is not closely related to either genus<ref name=moncalvo2002/> and its position in the [[Agaricales]] is still uncertain.<ref name=Justo2011/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Volvopluteus'' literally means \"''Pluteus'' with a volva\", making reference at the same time to the close relationship between both genera and to the presence of a volva, one of the [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics that separates them.<ref name=Justo2011/>\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Macroscopic characters ===\n''Volvopluteus'' [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] vary from relatively small ([[pileus (mycology)|cap]] {{convert|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter) to large (cap {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter), are pluteoid (i.e. with free [[lamella (mycology)|lamellae]] and discontinuous context of cap and [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]<ref name=Vellinga1988/>) and have a membranous white volva at the base of the stipe. The cap is ovate when young and then expands to convex or flat, it is always viscid to gelatinous when fresh and has white, grey or grey-brown color. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free from the stipe and they start out as white but they soon change to pink and then pinkish-brown as the spores are being produced. The stipe is centrally attached to the cap, more or less cylindrical, white and with a smooth or slightly [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] surface and it has white membranous volva at the base. The odor and taste are often reported as raphanoid (radish-like) or similar to that of raw potatoes in ''V.&nbsp;gloiocephalus''. The spore print is pink or pinkish-brown.<ref name=Justo2011/>\n\n=== Microscopic characters ===\n[[File:Volvopluteus gloiocephalus - Basidiospores.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Basidiospores]] of ''Volvopluteus gloiocephalus'']]\n[[File:Pileipellis (ixocutis) of Volvopluteus gloiocephalus.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Pileipellis]] (ixocutis) of ''Volvopluteus gloiocephalus'']]\n\nThe [[Basidiospore|spores]] of  ''Volvopluteus'' are relatively large (above 11&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] in length), ellipsoid to oblong, relatively thick-walled and not [[Amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] or [[dextrinoid]]. [[Basidia]] are usually 4-spored but 2- and 1-spored versions can sometimes occur. [[Pleurocystidia]] and [[cheilocystidia]] might be present or absent, and this character as well as the size and shape of these structures, can be used for morphologically separating the different species of the genus. The [[pileipellis]] is an ixocutis composed of parallel [[hypha]]e embedded in a gelatinous matrix. The [[Pellis|stipitipellis]] is a cutis and can be set with cylindrical [[caulocystidia]]. [[Clamp connections]] are absent from hyphae in all parts of the fruit body.<ref name=Justo2011/>\n\n=== Ecology ===\nAll species of ''Volvopluteus'' are [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophs]], and grow terrestrially in gardens, grassy fields (in or outside forests) and on accumulations of vegetable matter (compost, wood chips).<ref name=Justo2011/>\n\n== Classification ==\nThe type species, ''Volvopluteus gloiocephalus'', has been traditionally included in the genus ''Volvariella''.<ref name=Singer1986/><ref name=Boekhout1990/> The first comprehensive [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogeny]] of the Agaricales by Moncalvo et al.<ref name=moncalvo2002/> sampled two species of ''Volvariella'' (''[[Volvariella volvacea|V.&nbsp;volvacea]]'' and ''[[Volvariella hypophytis|V.&nbsp;hypophytis]]'') that were placed in a distant position from ''Pluteus''. The study of Matheny et al. in 2006 <ref name=matheny2006/> included ''Volvariella gloiocephala'' that was placed as the sister group of ''Pluteus''. The 2011 study of Justo et al. included a broader sampling of ''Volvariella'' species and confirmed that the genus, as traditionally defined, was [[polyphyletic]]: (i) the bulk of the genus, including the paddy-straw mushroom ''Volvariella volvacea'',  is not closely related to ''Pluteus'' and (ii) the group of species around ''Volvariella gloiocephala'' forms a separate [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] that constitutes the [[sister group]] of ''Pluteus''. The name ''Volvopluteus'' was then proposed to accommodate the latter group.<ref name=Justo2011/>\n\n''Volvopluteus'' differs from ''Volvariella'' morphologically by the average spore length over 11&nbsp;\u00b5m and the [[pileipellis]] composed of relatively thin [[hyphae]] embedded in a conspicuous gelatinous matrix. The same characters and the presence of a volva separate ''Volvopluteus'' from ''Pluteus''. All three genera are characterized by the pink to pink-brown spore prints and inverse [[Hymenophore|hymenophoral]] [[Trama (mycology)|trama]].\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe genus is [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] and has been reported from all [[continents]] except [[Antarctica]].<ref name=Singer1986/>\n\n== Edibility ==\n''Volvopluteus gloiocephalus'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]] although is cited as mediocre or of poor quality.<ref name=Davis2012/> Young specimens of ''V.&nbsp;gloiocephalus'' have white gills so it is possible to mistake them for an ''[[Amanita]]'' and vice versa.\n\nThe edibility of other species of the genus is not known.\n\n== Species ==\n[[File:Phylogeny volvopluteus.jpg|thumbnail|right|Phylogenetic relationships among the species ''Volvopluteus'' as inferred from [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] data. Based on the results presented by Justo et al.<ref name=Justo2011b/>]]\nFour species are currently accepted in the genus:\n\n*''[[Volvopluteus asiaticus]]'' Justo & Minnis\n*''[[Volvopluteus earlei]]'' (Murrill) Vizzini, Contu & Justo\n*''[[Volvopluteus gloiocephalus]]'' (DC) Vizzini, Contu & Justo\n*''[[Volvopluteus michiganensis]]'' (A.H. Sm.) Justo & Minnis\n\nOther species that probably belong in ''Volvopluteus'' based on their morphological characteristics:\n\n*''[[Volvaria microchlamida]]'' (Speg.) Sacc. Originally described from [[Argentina]].\n*''[[Volvariella alabamensis]]'' (Murrill) Shaffer. Originally described from [[Alabama]] (USA).\n*''[[Volvariella arenaria]]'' (Pat.) Singer. Originally described from the [[Arabian desert]].\n*''[[Volvariella californica]]'' (Earle) Singer. Originally described from [[California]] (USA).\n*''[[Volvariella canalipes]]'' (Murrill) Shaffer. Originally described from [[Florida]] (USA).\n*''[[Volvariella cnemidophora]]'' (Mont.) Singer. Originally described from [[Brazil]].\n*''[[Volvariella insignis]]'' Heinem. Originally described from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]\n*''[[Volvariella macrospora]]'' Singer. Originally described from [[Brazil]].\n*''[[Volvariella stercoraria]]'' (Peck) Singer. Originally described from [[Kansas]] (USA).\n\nAll these species are only known from their respective original descriptions, making it very difficult to establish if they represent independent [[taxa]]. For this reason they have not been formally reclassified in the genus ''Volvopluteus''.<ref name=Justo2011/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Justo2011>{{cite journal |author1=Justo A |author2=Vizzini A |author3=Minnis AM |author4=Menolli Jr. N |author5=Capelari M |author6=Rodr\u00edguez O |author7=Malysheva E |author8=Contu M |author9=Ghignone S |author10=Hibbett DS. |title=Phylogeny of the Pluteaceae (Agaricales, Basidiomycota): Taxonomy and character evolution |journal=Fungal Biology |year=2011 |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201320 |doi=10.1016/j.funbio.2010.09.012 |pmid=21215950|url=https://iris.unito.it/bitstream/2318/74776/1/Phylogeny%20of%20the%20Pluteaceae_4aperto.pdf }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=moncalvo2002>{{cite journal |vauthors=Moncalvo JM, Vilgalys R, Redhead SA, Johnson JE, James TY, Catherine Aime M, Hofstetter V, Verduin SJ, Larsson E, Baroni TJ, Greg Thorn R, Jacobsson S, Cl\u00e9men\u00e7on H, Miller OK Jr |title=One hundred and seventeen clades of euagarics |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |year=2002 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=357\u2013400 |pmid=12099793 |doi=10.1016/S1055-7903(02)00027-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=matheny2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Matheny PB, Curtis JM, Hofstetter V, Aime MC, Moncalvo JM, Ge ZW, Slot JC, Ammirati JF, Baroni TJ, Bougher NL, Hughes KW, Lodge DJ, Kerrigan RW, Seidl MT, Aanen DK, DeNitis M, Daniele GM, Desjardin DE, Kropp BR, Norvell LL, Parker A, Vellinga EC, Vilgalys R, Hibbett DS |title=Major clades of Agaricales: A multilocus phylogenetic overview |journal=Mycologia |year=2006 |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=982\u2013985 |pmid=17486974 |doi=10.3852/mycologia.98.6.982 |url=https://naldc-legacy.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=349&content=PDF |access-date=2018-04-29 |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Singer1986>{{cite book |author=Singer R. |title=The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy |edition=4th |publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books |location=Koenigstein K\u00f6nigstein im Taunus, Germany |year=1986 |page= |isbn=3-87429-254-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Vellinga1988>{{cite book |author=Vellinga EC. |chapter=Glossary |editor-last=Bas |title=Flora Agaricina Neerlandica |volume=1 |edition=1st |publisher=AA Balkema |location=Rotterdam, Netherlands |year=1988 |pages=54\u201364 |isbn=90-6191-859-6|display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Boekhout1990>{{cite book |author=Boekout T. |chapter=''Volvariella'' |editor-last=Bas |title=Flora Agaricina Neerlandica |volume=2 |edition=1st |publisher=AA Balkema |location=Rotterdam, Netherlands |year=1990 |pages=56\u201364 |isbn=90-6191-971-1|display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Davis2012>{{cite book |vauthors=Davis M, Sommer R, Menge JA |title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America |edition=1st |publisher=University of California Press |location=California |year=2012 |page=192 |isbn=978-0-520-27108-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Justo2011b>{{cite journal |title=Species recognition in Pluteus and Volvopluteus (Pluteaceae, Agaricales): morphology, geography and phylogeny |journal=Mycological Progress |year=2011 |author1=Alfredo Justo |author2=Andrew M.

It is pale in colour, and found on the floor in [[beech]] or [[birch]] woodland. Its smooth [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] features a particularly thick layer of flesh, and often has an incurved margin. Though generally considered [[edible mushroom|edible]], it is not recommended to be eaten raw. It is common in [[Europe]], and less common in [[North America]] and [[Australasia]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''L. pallidus'' was classified as a member of ''Lactarius'' by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]].

In shape, it is initially a flattened convex, developing a funnel-shaped depression with age. It is pale buff in colour, sometimes dull but often with rosy tint. It can also be a pale brown or pale flesh colour. The cap is smooth, firm and sticky, and has a thick layer of white to buff flesh. The margin is incurved on younger specimens.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The pale colour, incurved margin and smooth cap are its most distinguishing features.<ref name=\"Pegler\"/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|3|to|8|cm|in}} long, by {{convert|6|to|28|mm|in}} thick. In shape, the stem is cylindrical or slightly narrowed at the base, and is concolorous with the cap or whitish. The moderately decurrent, crowded gills are a pale rosy buff to yellowish buff, and leak white [[latex|milk]]. The spores are elliptic, with ridges of varying thickness running across them, forming few cross-connections. They typically measure 8 to 10 by 6 to 7 [[micrometre]]s. The spores leave a [[spore print]] that is pale ochre with a slight salmon tinge.<ref name=\"Phillips\">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Other Fungi of Great Britain and Europe|last= Phillips|first= Roger|year= 1981|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page= 83}}</ref>\n\n''L. pallidus'' is similar in appearance to ''[[Lactarius affinis|L. affinis]]'', but is differentiated by the fact that the former lacks the peppery taste of the latter.<ref name=\"McKnight\"/>\n\n==Edibility==\nThough generally considered edible,<ref>{{cite book |title= British Edible Fungi|last= Cooke|first= M.

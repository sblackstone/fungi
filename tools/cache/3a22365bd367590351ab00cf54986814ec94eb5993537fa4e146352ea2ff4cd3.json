It was placed in the Section ''Mexicanae'' of genus ''Psilocybe'' by [[Gast\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n]] due to its rhomboid-shaped spores. It has been found in [[Koh Samui]], a small tropical island in [[Thailand]], where some psychoactive species are consumed by both natives and tourists.<ref name=\"Allen1992\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is typically 7&ndash;15&nbsp;mm in diameter, almost convex to conic in shape, [[umbonate]] with a small [[Papilla (mycology)|papilla]]. The cap is viscid and has a separable [[Pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]]. It is a reddish-brown color when moist, but becomes lighter brown when dry. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 4.0&ndash;6.5&nbsp;cm high&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;cm thick, equal or slightly bulbous. The stipe is hollow, whitish in color, and covered with white [[fibril]]s. It is the same color as the cap, and stains blue when bruised.\nThe odor and taste are slightly like grain meal (''[[farinaceous]]'').{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Spores have been recorded in the range of 10.4-12.8 by 6.4-8&nbsp;[[\u03bcm]] and have a thick wall with a flattened, broad germ pore.\n\n==Habitat==\n''Psilocybe samuiensis'' was first picked in soil containing mixtures of sand and clay west of the village of Ban Hua Thanon, in [[Koh Samui]].  Since then it is now known to occur in Ranong Province in Thailand and also at Angkor Wat in Siem Riap, Kampuchea; and verified by Gaston Guzman. It grows scattered to gregarious in [[rice paddy|rice paddies]], fruiting from early July to late August.<ref name=\"Guzman1993\"/>\n\n==Chemistry==\nAnalysed by [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] and [[Thin layer chromatography|TLC]], [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] in the fruit bodies ranged from 0.023&ndash;0.90% (dry weight) and 0.05&ndash;0.81%, respectively. [[Baeocystin]] was also detected at the concentration of 0.01&ndash;0.05%.<ref name=\"Gartz1994\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Psilocybin mushrooms]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Allen1992\">Allen JW, Merlin MD.

It was [[species description|described]] as new to science by Japanese mycologist [[Tsuguo Hongo]] in 1953.<ref name=\"Hongo 1953\"/> Fruit bodies have convex, dark gray to blackish [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] measuring {{convert|3|\u2013|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], largely free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], are white and have short gills (lamellulae) interspersed. The [[basidiospore|spores]] are roughly spherical, [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and typically measure 8\u201311 by 7\u20139.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The mushroom is common in China, where it has caused poisonings,<ref name=\"urlAmanitaceae: Amanita fuliginea\"/> a review of cases in southern China finding it had been responsible for the poisoning of 352 people, 79 of which died, between 1994 and 2012.<ref name=chen14>{{cite journal | title=Investigation and analysis of 102 mushroom poisoning cases in Southern China from 1994 to 2012 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263574634 |author=Zuohong Chen & Ping Zhang & Zhiguang Zhang |journal = Fungal Diversity | year=2014|volume= 64|pages=123\u201331|doi= 10.1007/s13225-013-0260-7}}</ref>\n\nSeveral toxic [[peptide]]s have been identified from the mushroom: [[\u03b1-amanitin]], [[\u03b2-amanitin]], [[amaninamide]], [[phallacin]], [[phallacidin]], [[phallisacin]], [[desoxoviroidin]], and an additional unidentified [[phallotoxin]].<ref name=\"Deng 2011\"/> ''A.&nbsp;fuliginea'' is classified in ''[[Amanita]]'' section ''Phalloideae'', which contains several deadly toxic species. Mushroom poisoning is the main cause of mortality in food poisoning incidents in China. Although some responsible mushroom species have been identified, some were identified inaccurately. This study investigated and analyzed 102 mushroom poisoning cases in southern China from 1994 to 2012, which involved 852 patients and 183 deaths, with an overall mortality of 21.48 %. The results showed that 85.3 % of poisoning cases occurred from June to September, and involved 16 species of poisonous mushroom including the Amanita species\u201d<ref name=chen14/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n*[[List of deadly fungus species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Deng 2011\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Deng WQ, Li TH, Xi PG, Gan LX, Xiao ZD, Jiang ZD |title=Peptide toxin components of ''Amanita exitialis'' basidiocarps |journal=Mycologia |year=2011 |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=946\u20139 |doi=10.3852/10-319 |pmid=21471295|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1038605 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hongo 1953\">{{cite journal |author =Hongo T. |title=Larger fungi of the provinces of Omi and Yamashiro (4) |journal=Journal of Japanese Botany |year=1953 |volume=28 |pages=69\u201375}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlAmanitaceae: Amanita fuliginea\">{{cite web |author =Tulloss RE |title=''Amanita fuliginea'' |url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20fuliginea |publisher=Amanitaceae.org |accessdate=2014-11-30}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IndexFungorum|292451}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q19595858}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1953]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Deadly fungi]]\n\n{{Agaricales-stub}}"}]}}}}

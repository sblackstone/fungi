The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], or [[mushroom]]s, have a conical brownish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter atop a slender [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] up to {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. It has a white [[partial veil]] that does not leave a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the stem. American mycologist [[Alexander H. Smith]] first [[species description|described]] the species in 1937 as a member of the genus known today as ''[[Psathyrella]]''; it was transferred to ''[[Psilocybe]]'' by [[Rolf Singer]] in 1958.\n\n''Psilocybe pelliculosa'' is found in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the United States and Canada, where it grows on the ground in groups or clusters along trails or forest roads in [[coniferous forest|coniferous woods]]. A single collection has also been reported from Finland. The mushrooms contain the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] compounds [[psilocybin]] and [[baeocystin]], although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to ''P.&nbsp;pelliculosa'' can be distinguished by subtle differences in the form of the fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically by [[Alexander H. Smith]] in 1937 as ''Psathyra pelliculosa'',{{#tag:ref|Depending on the authority consulted, the taxon ''Psathyra'' is considered either a subgenus of ''[[Psathyrella]]'',<ref name=vanWaveren1985/> or synonymous with ''Psathyrella''.<ref name=Kirk2008/>|group=nb}} based on specimens he collected in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. The [[type specimen]] was collected near [[Tahkenitch Lake]], Oregon, in November  1935.<ref name=Smith1937/> In a 1941 publication, Smith revised his opinion, and considered the species to be the same as ''Hypholoma silvatica'' (later ''[[Psilocybe silvatica]]''), as he thought that the slight differences between the two were of no [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] significance.<ref name=Smith1941/> After reevaluating these two species in addition to several others closely related, [[Rolf Singer]] and Smith later reestablished the taxon and transferred it to ''[[Psilocybe]]'' in 1958.<ref name=Singer1958/> ''Psilocybe'' authority [[Gast\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n]] [[classification (biology)|classified]] the species in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Semilanceatae'', a grouping of related species characterized by having roughly ellipsoid, usually thick-walled [[spore]]s, and lacking [[pleurocystidia]].<ref>Guzm\u00e1n (1983), p. 342.</ref>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''pelliculosa'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''pellicula'', meaning \"film\",<ref name=Brodsky2008/> and refers to the gelatinous [[cap cuticle|pellicle]] of the cap.<ref name=\"Guzman1983 p.357\"/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"conifer Psilocybe\"<ref name=Lincoff2008/> or the \"striate Psilocybe\".<ref name=Miller1981/>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| caption1 = Spores are ellipsoid with an apical germ pore; ''top'': light microscopy; ''bottom'': [[scanning electron microscopy]]\n| width = 160\n| align = left\n| image1 = Psilocybe pelliculosa 13210.jpg\n| image2 = Psilocybe pelliculosa 13212.jpg\n}}\nThe cap of ''P.&nbsp;pelliculosa'' is initially sharply cone-shaped, and expands slightly over time to become broadly bell-shaped, but it never expands to become completely flat. The cap margin is pressed against the stem initially, and for a short time is appendiculate (has partial veil fragments hanging from the margin). The caps of mature specimens are smooth, sticky, and have translucent radial striations that reach dimensions of {{convert|0.8|to|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The color ranges from [[umber]] to [[Isabelline (colour)|isabella]] (dark dingy yellow-brown) when the mushroom is moist, and changes to pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]] when dry. The cap margin can have a greenish-gray tinge. The cap cuticle is a thin gelatinous covering that can be peeled off.<ref name=Smith1937/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an [[adnation|adnate]] attachment to the cap, are narrow to moderately broad, closely spaced, and eventually separate from the stem. Young gills are cinnamon-brown in color, with lighter edges, but darken in maturity because they become covered with the dark spores. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|6|to|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1.5|to|2|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, and roughly equal in width throughout except for a slightly enlarged base. The lower region of the stem is brownish in color and has silky \"hairs\" pressed against the stem; the upper region is grayish and pruinose (lightly dusted with powdery white granules).<ref name=Smith1937/> The flesh turns slightly bluish or greenish where it has been injured.<ref name=Singer1958/> The application of a drop of dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] solution on the cap or flesh will cause a color change to pale to dark yellowish to reddish brown; a drop on the stem produces a less intense or no color change.<ref name=\"Guzman1983 p.357\"/>\n\nThe [[spore print]] is purplish brown.<ref name=Ammirati2009/> Under the [[light microscopy|microscope]], the [[spore]]s appear dull purple-brown. They are ellipsoid to somewhat egg-shaped, and, according to Singer's original description, measure 8\u201310 by 4\u20135&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=Smith1937/> A later study of specimens collected from British Columbia, Canada, instead reported a larger spore size range of 10\u201313 by 6\u20137&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Guzman2008/> The spores have an apical [[germ pore]].<ref name=Singer1958/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and measure 22\u201335 by 7\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=\"Guzman1983 p.357\"/> There are abundant [[cystidia]] that form a sterile band on the edges of the gills (cheilocystidia); these cystidia are smooth, inflated, and fusoid-ventricose (enlarged in the middle and tapered toward both ends) with an sharp tip, and measure 25\u201330 by 6\u20139&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Smith1937/> The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] (an ixocutis) is made of a layer of roughly horizontal, gelatinized, wavy, hyaline [[hypha]]e that are 0.8\u20135.5&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter.<ref name=Singer1958/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Psilocybe semilanceata 6514.jpg|150px|thumb|right|''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'']]\nThe overall stature of the fruit bodies of ''P.&nbsp;pelliculosa'' is generally similar to those of ''[[Mycena]]'', ''[[Galerina]]'', or ''[[Hypholoma]]''.<ref name=Ammirati2009/> Smith noted a superficial resemblance to ''[[Psathyra fagicola|Psathyrella fagicola]]'', based on similarities in the nature of the cap cuticle, the coloring, and the stem base covered in silky fibers. ''Psilocybe pelliculosa'' may be distinguished from ''Psathyra fagicola'' by the presence of a partial veil, firm gills, and smaller fruit bodies.<ref name=Smith1937/> ''P.&nbsp;pelliculosa'' is frequently mistaken for the widespread ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata|P.&nbsp;semilanceata]]'', but the latter can be distinguished by its larger spores and a conical, [[umbo (mycology)|papillate]] cap.<ref name=Guzman2008/> Another similar species is ''[[Psilocybe silvatica]]'', and a microscope is needed to reliably distinguish between the two species.<ref name=Beug2011/> ''P.&nbsp;silvatica'', found from [[New York (U.S. state)|New York]] to [[Michigan]] and north to Canada, has longer spores.

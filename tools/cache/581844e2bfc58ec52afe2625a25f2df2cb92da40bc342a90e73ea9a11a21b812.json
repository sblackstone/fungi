The [[Gill (mycology)|gills]] are adnate and white. Short [[Gill (mycology)|gills]] are present. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is around 50\u201380&nbsp;mm (5\u20138&nbsp;cm) high, [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], stuffed, white, becoming orangish-brown. The bulb is fleshy, [[globose]] to [[ovoid]]. The ring is membranous, white, superior, skirt-like. The [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] is [[Membrane (biology)|membranous]], limbate, and fulvous-white. The spores measure 7 - 8 \u00d7 6 [[\u00b5m]] and are [[ovoid]] to subglobose. Its [[Spore (mycology)|spores]] have a length of around  9.2 - 10.3&nbsp;\u00b5m and a width of 7.5 - 7.8 [[\u00b5m]]. The spores are nothing but [[amyloid]] rubble and the collected specimens are unfortunately, almost entirely useless.<ref name=Amanitaceae>{{cite web | url = http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+manginiana| title = ''Amanita manginiana''|work=Amanitaceae.org |accessdate=2016-08-25}}</ref>\n\nThis species is very poorly known.

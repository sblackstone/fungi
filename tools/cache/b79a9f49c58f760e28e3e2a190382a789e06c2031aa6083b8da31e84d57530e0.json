Although it has [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]], it is a member of the order [[Boletales]], along with the boletes. It is a coral pink-capped mushroom which appears in pine forests in autumn, always near the related mushroom ''[[Suillus bovinus]]'', on which it appears to be [[Parasitism|parasitic]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n''Gomphidius roseus'' was initially described by [[Sweden|Swedish]] mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as ''Agaricus glutinosus \u03b2 roseus'' in 1821,<ref>{{cite book |title=Systema mycologicum, sistens fungorum ordines, genera et species huc usque cognitas [Taxonomical System for Mycology, consisting of an ordering of the fungi, genera and species, as currently understood], Vol. 1 |last=Fries |first=Elias Magnus |authorlink=Elias Magnus Fries|year=1821 |location= |page=315|language=la}}</ref> before he elevated it to species status and gave its current genus and binomial name in 1838. The genus name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]  '\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2' ''gomphos'' meaning \"plug\" or \"large wedge-shaped nail\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Liddell HJ, Scott R|year=1980|title=Greek-English Lexicon, Abridged Edition|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-910207-5|url=https://archive.org/details/lexicon00lidd}}</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''roseus'' is the [[Latin]] adjective \"pink\".<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=978-0-304-52257-6}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe mushroom has a coral-pink [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter, though sometimes larger, which is initially convex and later flattens and becomes a more brick-like colour with maturity.

It is white with a pinkish or wine-coloured tint and often flushed yellow at the base. The whitish flesh may also be tinged pink and has little taste or smell.

However, it is found exclusively with the related  Jersey cow mushroom (''[[Suillus bovinus]]''), and is now thought to be [[parasitism|parasitic]] upon its [[mycelia|mycelium]].<ref name=\"Olsson 2000\"/> This is evidenced by microscopic examination, which shows that ''G.&nbsp;roseus'' inserts [[Haustorium|haustoria]] in plant root cells and does not produce significant mycelium itself. Furthermore, ''G.&nbsp;roseus'' is never found growing in isolation, only with ''S.&nbsp;bovinus'' though the latter species is found without the former.<ref name=\"Olsson 2000\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsson PA, Munzenberger B, Mahmood S, Erland S |year=2000 |title=Molecular and anatomical evidence for a three-way association between ''Pinus sylvestris'' and the ectomycorrhizal fungi ''Suillus bovinus'' and ''Gomphidius roseus'' |journal=Mycological Research |volume=104 |issue=11 |pages=1372\u201378  |doi=10.1017/S0953756200002823|url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/146986 }}</ref><!-- cites previous 2 sentences -->\n\n== Edibility ==\n\n''Gomphidius roseus'' is not known to be [[Toxin|toxic]] but is reported to be of poor quality and hence not recommended for picking.<ref name=Phillips06/><ref name=Lamaison05>{{cite book |title=The Great Encyclopedia of Mushrooms |last=Lamaison |first=Jean-Louis |author2=Polese, Jean-Marie |year=2005 |publisher=K\u00f6nemann |isbn=978-3-8331-1239-3|page=34}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1931554}}\n\n[[Category:Boletales]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]"}]}}}}

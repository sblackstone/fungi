First formally [[species description|described]] in 1803, it was given its current name in 1872. Widely distributed, it is common in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in [[North Africa]], Central America, and Japan. The fungus is [[saprobic]], and produces [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) that grow on the [[forest floor|floor]] of [[coniferous forest]]s. The mushrooms have a bell-shaped to conical [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, set atop a slender [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] up to {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long with yellow to orange hairs at the base. The fungus is named after its characteristic bright orange [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] edges. A microscopic characteristic is the club-shaped [[Cystidium|cystidia]] that are covered with numerous spiky projections, resembling a [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom has not been determined. ''M.&nbsp;aurantiomarginata'' can be distinguished from similar ''[[Mycena]]'' species by differences in size, color, and [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. A 2010 publication reported the discovery and characterization of a novel [[pigment]] named mycenaaurin&nbsp;A, isolated from the mushroom. The pigment is responsible for its color, and it has [[antibiotic]] activity that may function to prevent certain bacteria from growing on the mushroom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species, originally named ''Agaricus marginatus'' by the Danish naturalist [[Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher]] in 1803, has several [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].<ref name=\"Schumacher 1803\"/> [[Elias Magnus Fries]] renamed it ''Agaricus aurantio-marginatus'' in his 1821 ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'',<ref name=\"Fries 1821\"/> while [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] called it ''Agaricus schumacheri'' in 1828.<ref name=\"Persoon 1828\"/> Although Schumacher had the earliest publication date, Fries's name is [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]], and so the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] he used is given [[Nomenclature#Scientific nomenclature|nomenclatural]] precedence. French mycologist [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] transferred the species to the genus ''[[Mycena]]'' in 1872.<ref name=\"Qu\u00e9let 1872\"/> In 1930 [[Karel Cejp]] considered it to be a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''[[Mycena elegans]]''.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena elegans var. aurantiomarginata\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Alexander H. Smith]]'s organization of the genus ''Mycena'', ''M.&nbsp;aurantiomarginata'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in [[section (biology)|section]] ''Calodontes'', subsection ''Granulatae'', which contains species with roughened cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on gill edges), such as ''[[Mycena rosella|M.&nbsp;rosella]]'', ''[[Mycena flavescens|M.&nbsp;flavescens]]'', ''M.&nbsp;elegans'', and ''[[Mycena strobilinoides|M.&nbsp;strobilinoides]]''.<ref>Smith (1947), [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=fung1tc&cc=fung1tc&idno=agk0806.0001.001&q1=mycena+elegans&view=image&seq=214&size=100 p. 196.]</ref> In his 1992 study of ''Mycena'', Dutch mycologist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus]] put ''M.&nbsp;aurantiomarginata'' in the section ''Luculentae'', characterized by species with an olive to yellowish-olive and moist cap, pallid to gray-olive gills with bright orange margins, brownish to grayish-olive stipes, white [[spore print|spore deposit]], and spiny cystidia.<ref name=\"MaasGeesteranus 1992\"/>'' M.&nbsp;aurantiomarginata'' was included in a 2010 [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis focused on clarifying the [[phylogenetic]] relationships between Northern European species in the section ''Calodontes''. The results suggested that, based on the similarity of [[60S|nuclear large subunit]] [[ribosomal DNA]] sequences, the fungus is closely related to ''[[Mycena crocata|M.&nbsp;crocata]]'' and ''[[Mycena leaiana|M.&nbsp;leaiana]]''.<ref name=\"Harder 2010\"/> This conclusion was previously corroborated by research that used molecular analysis to demonstrate that several ''Mycena'' species can be [[mycorrhiza]]l partners of the orchid ''[[Gastrodia confusa]]''.<ref name=\"Ogura-Tsujita 2009\"/>\n\nThe specific epithet ''aurantiomarginata'' is [[Latin]], and refers to the orange edges of its gills (''aurantius'', \"orange\"; ''marginata'', \"bordered\").<ref name=\"Rea 1922\"/> In the United Kingdom, the mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"golden-edge bonnet\".<ref name=\"urlRecommended English Names for Fungi - Scottish Fungi\"/>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Mycena aurantiomarginata 34028.jpg\n| caption1 = The cap color is somewhat variable, but typically darker in the center and lighter around the margin.\n| image2 = Mycena aurantiomarginata 286841.jpg\n| caption2 = The gills have orange edges that are brighter than the gill faces.\n}}\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''M.&nbsp;aurantiomarginata'' ranges in shape from obtusely conic to bell-shaped, and becomes flat in maturity, reaching diameters of {{convert|0.8|\u2013|2.0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The cap color is variable, ranging from dark [[olive (color)|olive]] [[wikt:fuscous|fuscous]] (dark brownish-gray) to yellowish-olive in the center, while the margin is orangish. Alexander H.

They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges.<ref name=\"Smith1947 pp.198-99\"/> Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted on the walls of the cystidia, is found in the [[cytosol]] and therefore more readily diffusible.<ref name=\"Smith 1975\"/> The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe,<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/> and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena aurantiomarginata\"/>\n\nThe cylindrical [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|3|\u2013|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.1|\u2013|0.2|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, hollow, and stiff but flexible;<ref name=\"Smith1947 pp.198-99\"/> it is somewhat thicker at the base.<ref name=\"Massee 1892\"/> It has a brownish to grayish-olive color that is sometimes tinged with shades of orange. The surface is smooth except for orange powder near the top, while the base is covered with stiff orange hairs. Smith reports the mushroom tissue to have no distinctive taste or odor,<ref name=\"Smith1947 pp.198-99\"/> while Aronsen says the odor is \"very conspicuous; sweet, fruity, often experienced as farinaceous or faintly of anise\".<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/> Like many small ''Mycena'' species, the [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown, as it is too insubstantial to consider collecting for the table.<ref name=\"Smith 1975\"/>\n\n[[File:Mycena aurantiomarginata 9900.jpg|thumb|right|The cystidia are club-shaped and spiny.]]\nThe [[spore]]s are elliptic, smooth, and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], with dimensions of 7\u20139 by 4\u20135&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=\"Smith1947 pp.198-99\"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells of the [[hymenium]]) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25\u201332 by 5.5\u20137&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/> Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are abundant and similar in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]: club-shaped to somewhat [[wikt:capitate|capitate]] (with a head),<ref name=\"Smith1947 pp.198-99\"/> the tops sparsely to densely covered with small spines (said to resemble a mace<ref name=\"Ammirati 2009\"/>), filled with a bright orange [[pigment]], and measuring 28\u201336 by 7\u201312&nbsp;\u03bcm.

This system prevents [[self-fertilization]] and ensures a high degree of [[genotype|genotypic]] diversity. When the fungal mycelia is grown in [[pure culture|culture]] on a [[petri dish]], the [[clonal colony|colonies]] are white, odorless, and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface, which abruptly become flattened to submerged, and occasionally form faint zone lines. The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts, especially where the hyphae are [[vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]] incompatible and destroy each other by [[lysis]].<ref name=\"Petersen 1997\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Mycena leaiana 58075.jpg|thumb|right|The bright orange ''Mycena leaiana'' grows in clusters on rotting wood.]]\n''Mycena aurantiomarginata'' is generally recognizable in the field by its olive-brown to orangish cap, bright orange gill edges, and yellowish hairs at the base of the stipe.

Fruit bodies of the fungus grow scattered, in groups, or in [[wikt:tuft|tufts]] under [[conifer]]s (usually [[spruce]] and [[fir]]), and are often found on [[moss]]. In North America, it is found in [[California]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[British Columbia]],<ref name=\"E-Flora BC\"/> and the species is widely distributed in western and northern Europe.<ref name=\"url:GBIF Portal\"/> In Central America, the mushroom has been collected on the summit of [[Cerro de la Muerte]] in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]], Costa Rica, on [[plant litter|leaf litter]] of ''[[Comarostaphylis arbutoides]]'' (a highly branched evergreen shrub or tree in the [[heath family]]).<ref name=\"urlFungi of Costa Rica\"/> In 2010, it was reported from [[Hokkaido]] in northern Japan, where it was found growing on ''[[Picea glehnii]]'' forest litter in early winter.<ref name=\"Shirayama 2010\"/> It has also been recorded from North Africa.<ref name=\"Breitenbach 1991\"/>\n\n==Bioactive compounds==\n[[File:Mycenaaurin A.png|thumb|right|250px|Mycenaaurin A]]\nIn 2010, a pigment compound isolated and characterized from fruit bodies of ''Mycena aurantiomarginata'' was reported as new to science by Robert Jaeger and Peter Spiteller in the ''[[Journal of Natural Products]]''. The chemical, mycenaaurin&nbsp;A, is a [[polyene]] compound that consists of a tridecaketide (i.e., 13 adjacent [[methylene bridge]] and [[carbonyl]] [[functional group]]s with two [[amino acid]] [[wikt:moiety|moieties]] on either end of the molecule). The authors posit that the flanking amino acid groups are probably derived [[biosynthesis|biosynthetically]] from [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-Adenosyl methionine]]. The tridecaketide itself contains an alpha-[[pyrone]], a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] [[wikt:hexaene|hexaene]], and a single [[alkene|alkenyl]] moiety. Jaeger and Spiteller suggest that mycenaaurin&nbsp;A might function as a defense compound, since it exhibits [[antibacterial]] activity against the [[Gram-positive]] bacterium ''[[Bacillus pumilus]]''. The chemical is only present in the fruit bodies, and not in the colorless [[mycelia]].<ref name=\"Jaeger 2010\"/> An earlier screening for antimicrobial activity in the fruit bodies revealed a weak ability to inhibit the growth of the fungi ''[[Candida albicans]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]''.<ref name=\"Suay 2000\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Ammirati 2009\">{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati J, Trudell S |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest |series=Timber Press Field Guide |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2009 |page=124 |isbn=0-88192-935-2}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Arora 1986\">{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=228 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Breitenbach 1991\">{{cite book |vauthors=Breitenbach J, Kr\u00e4nzlin F |title=Fungi of Switzerland: A Contribution to the Knowledge of the Fungal Flora of Switzerland : Boletes and Aparics |volume=3 |year=1991 |publisher=Verlag Edition Mycologia/Mad River Press |location=Lucerne, Switzerland |isbn=978-3-85604-030-7}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"E-Flora BC\">{{cite web |author=Gibson I. |editor-last=Klinkenberg B. |title=''Mycena aurantiomarginata'' (Fr.)

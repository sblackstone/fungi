The species is similar in appearance to several other closely related species in the genus ''[[Inocybe]]'' that also associate with willow, and so is most reliably differentiated microscopically.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n''Inocybe salicis'' was [[species description|described and named]] by [[Robert K\u00fchner]] in 1955 in the ''Bulletin Trimestriel de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mycologique de France''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=282702|title= ''Inocybe salicis''|publisher= [[Index Fungorum]].

The former was originally described in 1979 by [[Henri Romagnesi]], and had different [[spore]]s from those of ''I.&nbsp;salicis''. However, the [[holotype]] was reexamined in 2009 by Ukka Vauras and Katri Kokkonen, who observed that the spores were in fact identical to those of ''I.&nbsp;salicis'', which was described earlier, and so had precedence.<ref name=\"Vauras\">{{cite journal |last1= Vauras|first1= Ukka|last2= Kokkonen|first2= Katri|year= 2009|title= Finnish records on the genus ''Inocybe''.

Their surface can be cracked, covered in fibres or scaly. The caps change in shape as the mushrooms mature; while younger specimens have campanulate (bell-shaped) to conical caps, the caps of older specimens expand and flatten, with a broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] emerging. The [[cap cuticle]] forms a cutis. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are almost free, meaning that they only just connect to the stem, and are initially a pale grey, becoming an ochre-grey (or brownish) as they age. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] has a white to honey-coloured surface entirely covered in powdery granules. The stem is {{convert|1.5|to|3.5|cm|in|1}} long by {{convert|0.4|to|1|cm|in|1}} thick. There is a well-defined \"bulb\" at the base of the stem. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] smells spermatic, but the scent is not distinctive.<ref name=\"Collins1999\">{{cite book |title= A Photographic Guide to the Mushrooms of Britain and Europe|last= Courtecuisee|first= R\u00e9gis|year= 1999|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|isbn= 9780002200127|page= 520}}</ref>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n''Inocybe salicis'' produces [[spores]] of 9 to 11 by 6 to 8&nbsp;[[micrometers]] (\u03bcm).

The [[cystidia]] on the face and edge of the gills measure 50 to 70 by 12 to 25&nbsp;\u03bcm with a [[cell wall]] 2 to 3&nbsp;\u03bcm thick, and either taper at each end, or are shaped like swollen bottles, with the cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) more variable.

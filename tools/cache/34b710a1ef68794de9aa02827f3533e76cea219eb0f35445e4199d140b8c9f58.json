It is usually pale pink, but can be darker, pinker, or redder. It usually fades with age. At first it is convex, but later flattens, and has a tendency to become wavy. It is smooth and dry. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|4|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} high and the same colour as the cap, and is smooth, or finely fibrillose;<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |page=176 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref> often narrowing towards the base, and often misshapen. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed to almost free; sometimes notched and are white, giving a [[spore print]] of the same colour. They are quite closely spaced initially. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white; with very little taste, or smell.\n\nA similar species, ''[[Calocybe persicolor]]'' (Fr.) Singer, grows in tufts, has a liking for manured ground, and is sometimes recorded as a variety or variant of ''C.&nbsp;carnea''.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Calocybe carnea'' appears in spring, summer, and early autumn (usually after rain). It is frequent in Britain, Europe, Asia, and North America, growing in grassy meadows and fields and on lawns. It is very rarely found in woods, unless a grassy clearing is present. It seems to tolerate agricultural practices, because its fruiting bodies often appear on fertilized farmland.<ref name=T.Laessoe/>\n\n==Edibility==\nThis mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but is unsubstantial, as it is small and thin fleshed. It is also potentially confused with poisonous species.<ref name=Arora2nd/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3490762}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1972]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Lyophyllaceae]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]"}]}}}}

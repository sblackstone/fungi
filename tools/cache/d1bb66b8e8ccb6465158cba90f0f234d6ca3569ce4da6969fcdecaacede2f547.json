It is also known as ''Psilocybe galindii''. The species was named in honor of Mr. Carlos Galindo Arias and his family by Dr. [[Gast\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n]].\n\n==Description==\n*'''Cap''': 1.9 \u2013 2&nbsp;cm in diameter, [[conic]] to [[wikt:campanulate|campanulate]] or [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]], with a very slight [[Plant cuticle|papilla]], [[glabrousness (botany)|glabrous]], even to striate when moist, [[hygrophanous]], brown or yellowish brown fading to pale [[ochraceous]] or straw color. Staining blue-green where injured.\n*'''Gills''': [[Adnation|Adnate]], brown to dark purple brown, with whitish edges.\n*'''Stipe''': 5 \u2014 6.5&nbsp;cm x 1 \u2013 2&nbsp;mm, equal, hollow, no annulus, reddish brown in the middle, darker towards the base with long [[rhizomorphic]] strands. Veil inconspicuous, except for some white appressed silky fibrils on the pileus.\n*'''Spores''': Dark purple gray in deposit. (8.1)9.6 \u2014 12(14) x 7.1 \u2014 8 [[\u00b5m]], [[subrhomboid]] in face view or [[subellipsoid]] in side view(around 1 [[\u00b5m]]), yellowish brown, thick walled with a broad germ pore.\n*'''Odor''': [[Farinaceous]]\n*'''Taste''': [[Farinaceous]]\n*''' Microscopic Features''': Basidia: 18 \u2014 24 x 7.2 \u2014 9.6 [[\u00b5m]], [[hyaline]], 4-spored, [[ventricose]]. [[Pleurocystidia]]: 14.4 \u2014 21 x 7 \u2014 8.4 [[\u00b5m]], hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous, with short necks.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Psilocybe galindoi'' is found growing [[gregarious]]ly in soil at higher elevations and in tall grass in or near ''[[Pinus]]''-''[[Quercus]]'' (pine with oak) forests in [[Mexico]]. The holotype location is Pie de la Cuesta, Jalisco, Mexico - a bit south of Guadalajara.\n\n==Consumption and cultivation==\n[[File:Sclerotia galindoi.JPG|thumb|right|''Psilocybe galindoi'' [[sclerotia]] ]]\nLike several other [[psilocybin mushrooms]] in the [[genus]], a mushroom going under the name ''Psilocybe galindoi'' has been consumed by indigenous North American and Central American peoples for its [[entheogen]]ic effects.   This is a misidentification, as the mushroom they are cultivating is ''Psilocybe tampanensis'', and the real ''Psilocybe ganindoi'' is a synonym of ''Psilocybe mexicana''.\n\nIn the Western world, [[sclerotia]] of a mushroom misidentified as ''Psilocybe galindoi'' are sometimes cultivated for [[entheogenic]] or medicinal use. The sclerotia usually have a lower content of active substances than the actual mushrooms themselves.\n\n==References==\n*Guzman, G.

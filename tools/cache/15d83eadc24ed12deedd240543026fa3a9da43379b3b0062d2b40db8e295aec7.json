The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] has a diameter of up to {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} and is yellow, often brownish towards the centre. The appearance of the cap may be convex to plano-convex. The volva is present as felty, floccose patches, 2\u20135&nbsp;mm wide and up to 1&nbsp;mm thick. Unlike many of its relatives (for example, the ''[[Amanita pantherina]]''), the remnants of the [[universal veil]] do not usually persist on the cap, being easily washed away by rain.<ref name=\"urlTulloss\"/> The yellowish [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is relatively long (up to 16&nbsp;cm), and usually tapers upwards. There is a large, persistent [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free, crowded, and white to cream-colored to yellowish. The short gills (lamellulae) are truncate, numerous, and are evenly distributed. The [[basidiospore|spores]] measure 8.0\u201310.0 by 7.5\u20139.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] and are spherical (or nearly so) and [[inamyloid]]. There are no [[clamp connection|clamps]] present at the bases of [[basidia]]. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white in color and inedible.\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\nThis species is widespread in southwestern [[People's Republic of China|China]], mostly in [[Yunnan]].<ref name=\"Zhang 2004\"/>  It has also been reported that it is found in eastern [[Himalayas]] and adjacent regions.<ref name=\"Yang 2004\"/> It grows on soil in coniferous (''Abies'', ''Picea'') and broadleaved (''Betula'', ''Quercus'', ''Salix'') woodland in southwestern China up to an altitude of {{convert|4000|m}}.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Yang 2004\">{{cite journal |vauthors =Yang ZL, Weib M, Oberwinkler F |title=New species of ''Amanita'' from the eastern Himalaya and adjacent regions |journal=Mycologia |year=2004 |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=636\u201346 |url=http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/reprint/96/3/636.pdf |format = PDF |doi=10.2307/3762180 |pmid=21148883}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlTulloss\">{{cite web |author =Tulloss RE. |title=''Amanita altipes'' Zhu L.

''Pholiota'' spp. are separated from Armillaria by its yellowish to greenish-yellow tone and a dark brown to grey-brown spore print. [[Mushroom hunter]]s need to be wary of ''[[Galerina]] '' spp. which can grow side-by-side with ''Armillaria'' spp. on wood. ''[[Galerina]]'' have a dark brown spore print and are deadly poisonous ([[alpha-amanitin]]) \u2013 see: [[mushroom poisoning]].\n\n== Plant pathology ==\n{{main|Armillaria root rot}}\n\nHoney fungus is a \"white rot\" fungus, which is a [[pathogen]]ic organism that affects [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, woody climbers and, rarely, woody [[herbaceous perennial|herbaceous perennial plant]]s. Honey fungus can grow on living, decaying, and dead plant material.\n\nHoney fungus spreads from living trees, dead and live [[root]]s and stumps by means of reddish-brown to black [[rhizomorph]]s (root-like structures) at the rate of approximately 1 m a year, but infection by root contact is possible. Infection by spores is rare. Rhizomorphs grow close to the [[soil]] surface (in the top 20&nbsp;cm) and invade new roots, or the root collar (where the roots meet the stem) of plants. An infected tree will die once the fungus has [[Girdling|girdled]] it, or when significant root damage has occurred. This can happen rapidly, or may take several years. Infected plants will deteriorate, although may exhibit prolific [[flower]] or [[fruit]] production shortly before death.\n\nInitial symptoms of honey fungus infection include [[Forest dieback|dieback]] or shortage of leaves in spring. Rhizomorphs appear under the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] and around the tree, and mushrooms grow in clusters from the infected plant in autumn and die back after the first frost. However these [[Symptom#Symptom versus sign|symptoms and signs]] do not necessarily mean that the pathogenic strains of honey fungus are the cause, so other identification methods are advised before diagnosis. Thin sheets of cream colored [[mycelium]], beneath the bark at the base of the trunk or stem indicated that honey fungus is likely the pathogen. It will give off a strong [[mushroom]] scent and the mushrooms sometimes extend upward. On [[conifers]] honey fungus often exudes a gum or [[resin]] from cracks in the bark.\n\nThe linkage of morphological, genetic, and molecular characters of ''Armillaria'' over the past few decades has led to the recognition of intersterile groups designated as \u201cbiological species\u201d. Data from such studies, especially those using molecular diagnostic tools, have removed much uncertainty for mycologists and forest pathologists. New questions remain unanswered regarding the phylogeny of North American ''Armillaria'' species and their relationships to their European counterparts, particularly within the \u201c''Armillaria mellea'' complex\u201d. Some data suggest that North American and European ''A. gallica'' isolates are not monophyletic. Although North American and European isolates of ''A. gallica'' may be interfertile, some North American isolates of ''A. gallica'' are more closely related to the North American taxon ''A. calvescens'' than to European isolates of ''A. gallica''. The increase in genetic divergence has not necessarily barred inter-sterility between isolated populations of ''A. gallica''. Although the relationships among some groups in the genus seem clearer, the investigation of geographically diverse isolates has revealed that the relationship between some North American species is still unclear (Hughes et al. 2003).<ref name=\"hugh\">Hughes, M.B.; Weir, A.; Rogers, S.O. 2003.

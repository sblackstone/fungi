It is easily identified by its oily scent and the [[concentric]] bands on its cap. It is brown, and is probably named after its matt, \"quiet\" surface and colouration. It is found exclusively under oak trees in Europe, where it grows solitarily or in scattered groups in autumn months. In North America, the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''L. quietus'' var. ''incanus'' is fairly common in the same habitat. The mushroom's edibility is disputed.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n''L. quietus'' was first described and named by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]],<ref name=\"Cooke\">{{cite book |title= British Edible Fungi|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lOrahbcWdKAC&pg=PA230&dq=%22Lactarius+quietus%22&lr=lang_en&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES&client=firefox-a|last= Cooke|first= M.C.|year= 2007|publisher= Read Books|isbn= 978-1-4067-5608-1|page= 230}}</ref> who named it ''Agaricus quietus'' in the first volume of his ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'', published in 1821.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=241249|title= ''Agaricus quietus'' Fr. 1821 |publisher= [[MycoBank]]|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref> In his later ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici'', published in 1838, Fries transferred the species to ''Lactarius''.<ref name=\"MB\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=157234|title= ''Lactarius quietus'' (Fr.)

''incanus'' is typically slightly larger than the nominate variety, and younger specimens feature a whitish bloom, after which the variant is named. It has a sweet smell reminiscent of [[maple syrup]], and can be commonly found under oak trees. It can be confused with ''[[Lactarius aquifluus|L. aquifluus]]'' and ''[[Lactarius mutabilis|L. mutabilis]]'', but both of these species are found in coniferous woodland.<ref name=\"Roody\">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians|last= Roody|first= William C.|year= 2003|publisher= [[University Press of Kentucky]]|isbn= 978-0-8131-9039-6|page= 101|accessdate= 2008-08-18|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5HGMPEiy4ykC&pg=PA82&dq=%22Lactarius+quietus%22&lr=lang_en&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES&client=firefox-a#PPA101,M1}}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\n''Lactarius quietus'' has been variously described as edible<ref name=\"Cooke\"/><ref name=\"Phillips\"/> and inedible.<ref name=\"Jordan\"/><ref name=\"Pegler\"/> The milk has a mild or slightly bitter taste.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> ''L. quietus'' var.

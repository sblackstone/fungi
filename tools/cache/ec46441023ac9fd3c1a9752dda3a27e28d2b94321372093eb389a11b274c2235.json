For a modest psychedelic effect, a minimum of one gram of dried ''Psilocybe cubensis'' mushrooms is ingested orally. 0.25\u20131&nbsp;gram is usually sufficient to produce a mild effect, 1\u20132.5&nbsp;grams usually provides a moderate effect. 2.5&nbsp;grams and higher usually produces strong effects.<ref name=\"erowiddosage\">{{cite web|url=https://erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_dose.shtml |title=Erowid Psilocybin Mushroom Vault: Dosage|accessdate=2006-11-26|publisher=Erowid|year=2006|author=Erowid|format=shtml}}</ref> For most people, 3.5 dried grams (1/8 oz) would be considered a high dose and may produce an intense experience; this is, however, typically considered a standard dose among recreational users. For many individuals doses above 3&nbsp;grams may be overwhelming. For a few rare people, doses as small as 0.25&nbsp;grams can produce full-blown effects normally associated with very high doses. For most people, however, that dose level would result in virtually no effects. Due to factors such as age and storage method, the psilocybin content of a given sample of mushrooms will vary. \nEffects usually start after approximately 20\u201360 minutes (depending on method of ingestion and stomach contents) and may last from four to ten hours, depending on dosage. Visual distortions often occur, including walls that seem to breathe, a vivid enhancement of colors and the animation of organic shapes.\n\nThe effects of very high doses can be overwhelming depending on the particular phenotype of cubensis, growth method, and the individual. ''Psilocybe cubensis'' mushrooms can come in rather different sizes. It is recommended that one weigh the actual mushrooms, as opposed to simply counting them. People taking [[MAOI]]s need to be careful, as psilocybin and psilocin are metabolized by the enzyme [[monoamine oxidase]]. A [[MAOI|monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] reduces the body's ability to metabolize psilocin and psilocybin, greatly increasing the intensity of the experience. This can sometimes produce uncomfortable or undesirably intense experiences.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== Legality ==\n{{Main|Legal status of psilocybin mushrooms}}\n\n[[Psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] are listed as [[Schedule I drug]]s under the United Nations 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref>{{cite web|title=List of  psychotropic substances  under international control |publisher=[[International Narcotics Control Board]] |date=August 2003 |accessdate=25 June 2007 |url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205125434/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |archivedate= 5 December 2005 }}</ref>  However, mushrooms containing psilocybin and psilocin are not illegal in some parts of the world.  For example, in Brazil they are legal, but extractions from the mushroom containing psilocybin and psilocin remain illegal. In the United States, ''Psilocybe cubensis'' is illegal in all states. However, as of May 8, 2019 Denver, Colorado has decriminalized it for those 21 and up. On June 4th, 2019, Oakland, California followed suit, decriminalizing psilocybin containing mushrooms as well as the Peyote cactus.\n\n== Cultivation  ==\n\nPersonal-scale cultivation of ''Psilocybe cubensis'' mushrooms ranges from the relatively simple and small-scale [[PF Tek]] and other \"cake\" methods, that produce a limited amount of mushrooms, to advanced techniques utilizing methods of professional mushroom cultivators. These advanced methods require a greater investment of time, money, and knowledge, but reward the diligent cultivator with far larger and much more consistent harvests.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n[[Terence McKenna]] and his brother [[Dennis McKenna|Dennis]] made ''Psilocybe cubensis'' particularly famous when they published ''Psilocybin: The Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide'' in the 1970s upon their return from the [[Amazon rainforest]], having deduced new methods (based on pre-existing techniques originally described by J.P. San Antonio<ref>''San Antonio, J.P. \"A Laboratory Method to Obtain Fruit from Cased Grain Spawn of the Cultivated Mushroom \n''[[Agaricus bisporus]]''\". ''Mycologia'' 63: 16-21 (1971).</ref>) for growing [[psilocybin mushrooms]] and assuring their audience that ''Psilocybe cubensis'' were amongst the easiest psilocybin-containing mushrooms to cultivate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.levity.com/eschaton/tmUSed.html|title=Terence McKenna's books in print|publisher=|accessdate=December 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nPotency of cultivated specimens can vary widely in accordance with each flush (harvest). In a classic paper published by Jeremy Bigwood and M.W. Beug, it was shown that with each flush, [[psilocybin]] levels varied somewhat unpredictably but were much the same on the first flush as they were on the last flush; however, [[psilocin]] was typically absent in the first two flushes but peaked by the fourth flush, making it the most potent. Two strains were also analyzed to determine potency in caps and stems: In one strain the caps contained generally twice as much psilocybin as the stems, but the small amount of psilocin present was entirely in the stems. In the other strain, a trace of psilocin was present in the cap but not in the stem; the cap and stem contained equal amounts of psilocybin. The study concluded that the levels of psilocybin and psilocin vary by over a factor of four in cultures of ''Psilocybe cubensis'' grown under controlled conditions. <ref>Bigwood, J. and M.W. Beug. \"Variation of psilocybin and psilocin levels in repeated flushes (harvests) of mature sporocarps of Psilocybe cubensis (Earle) Singer.\" Journal of Ethnopharmacology 5(3): 287-291 (1982).</ref>\n\n== Relationship with cattle  ==\n\nWith cow dung being the preferred habitat of  ''Psilocybe cubensis,'' its circumtropical distribution is largely encouraged, if not caused, by the worldwide cattle ranching industry.<ref>http://www.psilosophy.info/resources/Psilocybin.magic.mushroom.growers.guide.pdf</ref>\n\nBecause ''Psilocybe cubensis'' is intimately associated with cattle ranching, the fungus has found unique dispersal niches not available to most other members of the [[Strophariaceae]] family. Of particular interest is the [[cattle egret]] (''Bubulcus ibis''), a colonizer of Old World origin (via S. America), whose range of distribution overlaps much of that of ''Psilocybe cubensis.'' Cattle egrets typically walk alongside cattle, preying on insects; they track through spore-laden vegetation and cow dung, and transfer the spores to suitable habitat, often thousands of miles away during migration activities. This type of spore dispersal is known as [[zoochory]], and it enables a parent species to propagate over a much greater range than it could achieve alone. The relationship between cattle, cattle egrets, and ''Psilocybe cubensis'' is an example of [[symbiosis]] -- a situation in which dissimilar organisms live together in close association.<ref>Smith, D. \"The cattle egret (''Bubulcus ibis''): colonizer of Old World origin and a vector of ''Psilocybe cubensis'' spores.\" Stain Blue Press, Spring, Texas (1996). http://www.stainblue.com/cubensis.html</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of psilocybin mushrooms]]\n* [[Psilocybin mushrooms]]\n* [[Botanical identity of soma-haoma]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n<ref name=\"Stamets2\">{{cite book |last1=Stamets |first1=Paul |title=The Mushroom Cultivator |date=1983 |publisher=Agarikon Press |location=Olympia, Washington, 98507, USA |isbn=0-96 1 0798-0-0}}</ref>\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Guzman, G.

This mushroom is closely related to ''[[Psilocybe subfimetaria]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe stuntzii]]''.\n\n== Description ==\n\n*The '''cap''' is 1\u20136&nbsp;cm, conical to convex, tan brown, [[hygrophanous]], margin striate when moist, and often has a broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. It bruises bluish where damaged.\n*The '''gills''' are crowded, sometimes forking, slightly mottled, cream color when young, violet brown in age, with adnate to adnexed and sometimes subdecurrent attachment.  \n*The '''spores''' are dark violet brown, rhomboid to subrhomboid to subellipsoid, and 7.5-12 x 6.5-8.5 [[\u00b5m]].\n*The '''stipe''' is 2.5 to 6.5&nbsp;cm long, .2 to .3&nbsp;cm thick, white to gray, finely striate, and equal to slightly enlarged near the base. It has a well-developed partial veil which leaves a persistent membranous annulus on the upper stem. It bruises blue where damaged.\n*The '''taste''' and ''odor'' are farinaceous.\n<!-- *'''Microscopic features''': -->\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n{{primary sources|section|date=December 2008}}\n''Psilocybe subaeruginascens'' grows in gregariously and in cespitose clusters in wood chips, piles of leaves, and woody debris in urban areas and along trails and roads in deciduous forests and gardens. It is occasionally found in dung. It is found from April to July in southern [[Japan]] and subtropical [[Java]] and in [[Kwazulu-Natal]] [[South Africa]] where it occurs in February and March.  A similar species, [[Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata]] has been reported from the [[Bay Area]] of [[California]].<ref>http://www.sporeworksgallery.com/Stuntzae</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of Psilocybin mushrooms]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Guzman, G.

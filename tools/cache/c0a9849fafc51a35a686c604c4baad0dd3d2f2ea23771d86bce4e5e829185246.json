The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of the fungus has a smooth, violet-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, and a slender [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long. Distinguishing microscopic characteristics of the mushroom include the relatively large, distinctly [[amyloid]] spores (turning blue to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), the smooth, spindle-shaped cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge), the absence of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), the [[diverticulum|diverticulate]] hyphae of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]], and the absence of [[clamp connection]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==\nThe fungus was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999, and described as a new species along with seven other Japanese Mycenas in a 2007 publication. The mushroom's Japanese name is ''Izumino-ashinagatake'' (\u30a4\u30ba\u30df\u30ce\u30a2\u30b7\u30ca\u30ac\u30bf\u30b1). The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''fonticola'' is derived from [[Latin]], and means \"dweller in fountain\".<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\nAccording to Takahashi, various macro- and microscopic features suggest that this species is best [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Fragilipedes'' (Fr.) Qu\u00e9l., as defined by the Dutch ''Mycena'' specialist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus|Maas Geesteranus]].<ref name=Takahaski2007/><ref name=MaasGeesteranus1980/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|1|to|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, and ranges in shape from conical to convex to bell-shaped. The surface has radially arranged shallow grooves extending almost to the center of the cap. The cap surface is somewhat [[hygrophanous]] (changing color as it loses or absorbs water), dry, and smooth. It is colored violet-brown when young, then becomes somewhat paler from the margin. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to 1&nbsp;mm thick, and lacks any distinctive odor or taste. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is long and slender compared to the size of the cap, typically {{convert|7|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} tall by {{convert|1|to|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} thick, cylindrical, slightly enlarged at the base, and hollow. It is grayish-brown to violet-brown at the top, gradually becoming violet-brown on the lower portion. The stem surface is initially [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (appearing to be covered with a fine whitish powder), but becomes smooth in age. The stem base bears large, bristle-like coarse white hairs. The [[Lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed (narrowly attached to the stem), with between 23\u201327 reaching the stem. The gills are up to {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} broad, thin, and have a whitish or with a grayish hue; the gills edges are the same color as the gill faces.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, colorless, distinctly [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] (absorbing iodine stain from [[Melzer's reagent]]), thin-walled, and measure 11.5\u201314 by 6\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are 17\u201328 by 6\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, and four-spored. The basidioles (immature or aborted basidia) are club-shaped. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] found on the gills edges) are 32\u201339 by 5\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m, abundant, spindle-shaped to roughly club-shaped, often apically broadly rounded, smooth, colorless, and thin-walled. They form a sterile gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are absent in this species. The [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] tissue (tissue of the [[hymenium]]-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 7\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical, smooth, colorless, and [[dextrinoid]] (staining reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent). The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical, and densely covered with warty or finger-like thin-walled diverticulae that are colorless or contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap cuticle are parallel, colorless or with cytoplasmic brownish pigment, dextrinoid, and have short and inflated cells measuring up to 30&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are covered with scattered, thin-walled warty or finger-like [[diverticulum|diverticulae]] that can be either colorless, or contain brownish [[pigment]] in the [[cytoplasm]]. The flesh of the stem is made of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 5\u201317&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent in all tissues of this species.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Mycena mustea]]'' is another similar ''Mycena'' that was discovered and reported concurrently with ''M.&nbsp;fonticola''; it differs in forming a pale grayish purple cap with a low and broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. Microscopically, it has club-shaped cheilocystidia with several apical short finger-like outgrowths, and nondiverticulate hyphae in the stem cuticle.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Mycena fonticola'' is known only from [[Kanagawa]], Japan. Fruit bodies are found solitary or scattered, on dead leaves and twigs in low-elevation forests dominated by the [[oak]] species ''[[Quercus myrsinaefolia]]'' and ''[[Quercus serrata|Q.&nbsp;serrata]]''.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Fungorum>{{cite web |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=532055 |title=''Mycena fonticola'' Har.

Found exclusively in North America, the mushroom may be recognized in the field by the medium to large white [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s with pale orange tints, and the dense covering of pale orange or reddish-brown powdery conical warts on the cap surface. The mushroom also has a characteristic large bulb at the base of its [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] with a blunt short rooting base, whose shape is suggestive of the [[common name]]s '''carrot-footed Lepidella''', '''carrot-foot Amanita''', or '''turnip-foot Amanita'''. The mushroom has a strong odor that has been described variously as \"sweet and nauseous\", or compared to an old ham bone, or soap. [[Edible mushroom|Edibility]] is unknown for the species, but consumption is generally not recommended due its position in the ''[[Amanita]]'' subgroup ''Lepidella'', which contains some poisonous members.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n''Amanita daucipes'' was first described in 1856 by the mycologists [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Jean Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Camille Montagne|Camille Montagne]], who named it ''Agaricus daucipes''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Montagne JFC|year=1856|title=Sylloge Generum Specierumque Cryptogamarum|page=96|language=Latin}}</ref> It was later renamed to ''Amanitopsis daucipes'' by [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]], in 1887.<ref>{{cite journal|author =Saccardo PA|year=1887|title=Sylloge Hymenomycetum, Vol. I.

The cap surface is dry to shiny, and white with a pale orange hue. It is densely covered with white to pale orange or reddish-brown conical warts. The warts, remnants of the [[universal veil]], are randomly distributed on the cap surface and become fluffier and cotton-like ([[wikt:flocculent|flocculent]]) near the edge (or margin) of the cap.<ref name=Bhat2004/> Drier specimens may have the cap surface completely cracked around the bases of the individual warts.<ref name=\"Tullosweb\"/>[[image:Amanita daucipes 56224.jpg|thumb|left|Mature specimens have nearly flat caps.]][[image:Amanita daucipes 54738.jpg|thumb|left|The basal bulb is spindle- or turnip-shaped, and roots into the soil.]]The conical warts are detersile, meaning they may be easily removed from the cap surface without leaving a residue or a scar. The margin of the cap does not have [[wikt:striation|striations]], and like other ''Lepidella'' members, may have irregular veil remnants hanging from it. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free, crowded closely together, moderately narrow, and white to yellowish white in color. The short gills that do not extend the full distance from the stem to the cap edge (known as lamellulae) are rounded to attenuate (gradually narrowing), and of varying lengths.<ref name=Bhat2004/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|7.5|to|20|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|0.8|to|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and is attached to the center of the cap. It tapers slightly towards the apex, and is solid, dry, white or sometimes with a pale orange tint, and covered with tufts of soft woolly hairs. If handled, the stem will slowly bruise and discolor to approximately the same color as the cap.<ref name=\"Tullosweb\"/> The basal bulb is large, reaching up to {{convert|15|by|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and is broadly spindle- to turnip-shaped.<ref name=Jenkins1986>{{cite book |author =Jenkins DB |title=''Amanita'' of North America |publisher=Mad River Press |location=Eureka, California |year=1986|page=92|isbn=0-916422-55-0}}</ref> The bulb has a circular ridge on its upper part where the universal veil was previously attached, and the bulb may have longitudinal splits. It is covered with pinkish to reddish veil remains. The [[partial veil]] forms an ephemeral [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the upper part of the stem. It is white to pale yellow, and usually falls off as the cap expands; fragments of the ring may often be found lying on the ground near the base of the stem.<ref name=Roody2003/> The universal veil remnants, when present, are similar to that on the cap.

They can be found growing in small groups along the side of tree roots. This mushroom is [[edible mushrooms|edible]], but a few expert [[mushroom hunter]]s insist that young specimens should be avoided as can be confused with ''[[Stropharia aeruginosa]]''. The [[anise]] odor is due to the presence of [[Anisaldehyde|''p''-anisaldehyde]] and a small amount of [[benzaldehyde]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/content/full/94/3/373|title=The anise-like odor of ''Clitocybe odora'', ''Lentinellus cochleatus'' and ''Agaricus essettei''|journal=Mycologia|year=2002|volume=94|pages=373\u2013376|doi=10.1080/15572536.2003.11833201 |author=Sylvie Rapior|author2=Sophie Breheret|author3=Thierry Talou|author4=Yves P\u00e9lissier|author5=Jean-Marie Bessi\u00e8re|last-author-amp=yes}}</ref> This odor can give away the mushroom's presence before it is observed by eye.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst described by the French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Francois Pierre Bulliard]] (1742\u20131793). The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''odora'' is from the [[Latin]] meaning \"perfumed\".<ref name=GiovanniPacioni1993>{{cite book | author = Giovanni Pacioni  | year = 1993 | title = The Macdonald Encyclopedia of Mushrooms and Toadstools (English version) | publisher = Little, Brown & Company Ltd. | isbn = 0-316- 90625-5}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nYoung specimens have a light blue texture on the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] which fades to grey in age. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] and [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] are white with no [[annulus (mycology)|ring]].\n\nFull grown specimens have blue-green, flowery, cup-shaped caps; the gills are creamy white, or reflect the blue-green color of the cap. The cap's surface feels rough. The stem is thick, is attached to the gills with no rings, and is textured, with a pale-yellow colour. The younger ones have a bell-shaped cap with a light blue or icy blue colour. The gills and stem are white, or bluish green.  It has a strong scent and taste of [[aniseed]], hence its name.\n\nThere is a white [[variety (botany)|variety]] (''Clitocybe odora var.alba'' [[Jakob Emanuel Lange|Lange]]) that has the same strong odour.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nFound in both [[deciduous]], and [[coniferous]] woods, it is widespread in the temperate zones, occurring in Asia, Europe, and North America. On the East Coast of North America it favours [[oak]] woodland, but it is often abundant in the coniferous forests of the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nThe caps can be dried, and used as a condiment, or used fresh for flavouring.<ref name=R.Mabey>{{cite book |first1= Richard |last1= Mabey |authorlink=Richard Mabey |year= 1975 |title= Food For Free, a guide to the edible wild plants of Britain |publisher= Fontana / Collins }}</ref> Mushroom hunters should be sure to pick mature ones, mainly because the younger ones can be confused with several similar poisonous ones that grow along with this mushroom. Every part of the mushroom should be examined before collecting for the table. Also, the stem and the cut cap should be checked to see if there are any fly larvae.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.mycologia.org/content/vol94/issue3/images/medium/myco-94-03-01-t01.gif Volatile composition of fresh Clitocybe odora fruiting bodies]\n* [http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/content/full/94/3/373 Mycologia - The anise-like odor of Clitocybe odora, Lentinellus cochleatus and Agaricus essettei]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091124235715/http://healing-mushrooms.net/archives/clitocybe-odora.html healing-mushrooms.net's entry on ''Clitocybe odora'']\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q913466}}\n\n[[Category:Clitocybe|odora]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]"}]}}}}

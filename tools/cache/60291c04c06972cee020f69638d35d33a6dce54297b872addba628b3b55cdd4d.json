It has a distinctive orange cap, yellow gills and stem. Similar orange-capped species occur in North America and India. It was known to and valued by the Ancient Romans, who called it Boletus, a name now applied to a very different type of fungus. The word Amanita comes from Greek 'amanites' meaning mushroom and the word Caesarea comes from Latin 'caesarea' meaning caesarean, of, for, or belonging to Caesar, as this mushroom was highly valued by Roman emperors.<ref>Amanita caesarea. http://alphagamma.150m.com/Amanita_caesarea.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707055156/http://alphagamma.150m.com/Amanita_caesarea.html |date=2011-07-07 }}</ref><ref>http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/amanita/species/caesarea.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716104330/http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/amanita/species/caesarea.html |date=2011-07-16 }} by R.E.

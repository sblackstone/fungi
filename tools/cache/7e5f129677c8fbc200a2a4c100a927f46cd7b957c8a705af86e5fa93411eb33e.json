The chaga spores enter the tree through wounds, particularly poorly healed branch stubs. The white rot decay will spread throughout the [[Wood|heartwood]] of the host. During the infection cycle, penetration of the [[Wood|sapwood]] occurs only around the sterile exterior [[mycelium]] mass.<ref name=\"Lee 199\u2013202\"/> The chaga fungus will continue to cause decay within the living tree for 10\u201380+ years. While the tree is alive, only sterile mycelial masses are produced (the black exterior conk). The sexual stage begins after the tree, or some portion of the tree, is killed by the infection. ''I. obliquus'' will begin to produce fertile fruiting bodies underneath the bark. These bodies begin as a whitish mass that turn to brown with time. Since the sexual stage occurs almost entirely under the bark, the fruiting body is rarely seen.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/inonotus_obliquus.html|title=Inonotus obliquus (MushroomExpert.Com)|last=MushroomExpert.Com|website=www.mushroomexpert.com|access-date=2017-08-15}}</ref> These fruiting bodies produce [[basidiospore]]s which will spread the infection to other vulnerable trees.\n\n== Common names ==\nThe name ''chaga'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t\u0283|\u0251\u02d0|\u0261|\u0259|}} ) comes from the Russian name of the fungus ([[wikt:transliterate|transliterated]] from ''\u0447\u0430\u0433\u0430''), which in turn is purportedly derived from the word for the fungus in [[Komi-Permyak language|Komi-Permyak]], the language of the [[indigenous peoples]] in the [[Kama River|Kama River Basin]], west of the [[Ural Mountains]].

Currently, three extraction processes are used.\n* Hot water extraction is the most common and the cheapest method.

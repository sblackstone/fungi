Characterized by their bright orange [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] and stalks and reddish-orange [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] edges, they usually grow in dense clusters on [[deciduous]] logs. The [[biological pigment|pigment]] responsible for the orange color in this species has [[antibiotic]] properties. A [[Variety (botany)|variety]] of the species, ''Mycena leaiana'' var.

The species was named after Thomas Gibson Lea (1785\u20131844), a mushroom collector from Ohio who had sent a collection of specimens to Berkeley for identification.<ref name=\"isbn0-919433-47-2\">{{cite book |author=Schalkwijk-Barendsen, Helene M.

The surface of the cap is sticky, especially in moist weather, and smooth, while the margin often has striations. The [[flesh|trama]] is soft, watery, and white. The gills are adnexed in attachment (gills narrowly attached/tapering toward stem so that their attachment is almost free), crowded together, and yellowish in color, with the color deepening to bright orange-red at the edges. The deepening in color at the edges is due to an orange [[pigment]] that is contained largely within cells called [[cheilocystidia]].<ref name=\"urlMycena leaiana, the orange Mycena, Tom Volks Fungus of the Month for September 2005\">{{cite web |url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/sep2005.html |title=''Mycena leaiana'', the orange Mycena, Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for September 2005 |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> If handled, the yellow pigment will rub off and stain the skin.<ref name=\"urlMycena leaiana\">{{cite web |url=http://www.messiah.edu/Oakes/fungi_on_wood/gilled%20fungi/species%20pages/Mycena%20leaiana.htm |title=Mycena leaiana |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is typically {{convert|3|to|7|cm|in}} long by 2\u20134&nbsp;mm thick.<ref name=\"isbn1-58729-627-6\"/> The diameter of the stipe is more or less equal throughout its length, although it may be slightly enlarged at the base.

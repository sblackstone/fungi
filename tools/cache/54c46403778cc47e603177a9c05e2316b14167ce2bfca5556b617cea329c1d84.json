It is a large [[bolete]] from Western North America with distinguishing features that include a netted surface on the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], a red to brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and stem color, and red pores that stain blue upon injury.  Until 2005 this was the only bolete that has been implicated in the death of someone consuming it; a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms in 1994 after eating this fungus with the husband succumbing. Autopsy revealed [[infarction]] of the midgut.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nAmerican mycologists [[Harry D. Thiers]] and Roy E. Halling were aware of confusion on the west coast of North America over red-pored boletes; two species were traditionally recognised\u2014''[[Boletus satanas]]'' and ''[[Boletus eastwoodiae]]''. However, they strongly suspected the type specimen of the latter species was in fact the former. In reviewing material they published a new name for the taxon, which Thiers had written about in local guidebooks as ''B. eastwoodiae'', as they felt that name to be invalid. Hence in 1976 they formally described ''Boletus pulcherrimus'',<ref name=Thiers1976/><!-- cites previous 3 sentences --> from the [[Latin]] ''pulcherrimus'', meaning \"very pretty\".<ref>{{Cite book|author = Simpson DP.| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=978-0-304-52257-6}}</ref> It was transferred to the genus ''[[Rubroboletus]]'' in 2015 along with several other allied reddish colored, blue-staining bolete species such as ''B. eastwoodiae'' and ''B. satanas''.<ref name=\"Frank 2015\">{{cite journal |author=Frank JL. |title=Nomenclatural novelties |journal=Index Fungorum |issue=248 |date=June 11, 2015 |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Publications/Index%20Fungorum%20no.248.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nColored various shades of olive- to reddish-brown, the cap may sometimes reach {{convert|25|cm|in|0|sp=us}} in diameter and is convex in shape before flattening at maturity.

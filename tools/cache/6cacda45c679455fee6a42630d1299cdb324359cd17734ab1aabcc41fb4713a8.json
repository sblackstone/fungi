Commonly known as the '''bird's nest fungi''', their [[fruiting body|fruiting bodies]] resemble tiny egg-filled birds' nests. As they are [[saprobic]], feeding on decomposing [[organic matter]], they are often seen growing on decaying wood and in soils enriched with wood chips or [[Bark (botany)|bark]] [[mulch]]; they have a widespread distribution in most ecological regions. The five genera within the family, namely, ''[[Crucibulum]]'', ''[[Cyathus]]'', ''[[Mycocalia]]'', ''[[Nidula]]'', and ''[[Nidularia]]'', are distinguished from each other by differences in morphology and peridiole structure; more recently, [[phylogenetic]] analysis and comparison of DNA sequences is guiding new decisions in the taxonomic organization of this family.\n\n==History==\n\nBird's nest fungi were first mentioned by Flemish botanist [[Carolus Clusius]] in ''Rariorum plantarum historia'' (1601). Over the next couple of centuries, these fungi were the subject of some controversy regarding whether the peridioles were seeds, and the mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature. For example, the French botanist [[Jean-Jacques Paulet]], in his work ''Trait\u00e9 des champignons'' (1790&ndash;3), proposed the erroneous notion that peridioles were ejected from the fruiting bodies by some sort of spring mechanism.<ref name=Brodie15>Brodie p. 15.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe Nidulariaceae have a ''gasteroid'' fruiting body, meaning that the spores develop internally, as in an ''angiocarp''. Fruiting bodies are typically gregarious (growing together in groups, but not joined together). Young fruiting bodies are initially covered by a thin membrane that [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehisces]] irregularly or by a ''circumscissile'' split, in a circular line around the circumference of the cup opening. Fruiting bodies (also called ''peridia'') are small, generally between 5&ndash;15&nbsp;mm wide and 4&ndash;8&nbsp;mm high, urn- or vase-shaped, and contain one to several disc-shaped peridioles that resemble tiny eggs.<ref name=\"isbn0-916422-74-7\">{{cite book |vauthors=Miller HR, Miller OK |title=Gasteromycetes: morphological and developmental features, with keys to the orders, families, and genera |publisher=Mad River Press |location=Eureka, California |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=978-0-916422-74-5 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>\nThis fungus is inedible.\n\n;Peridiole structure\n\nPeridioles contain glebal tissue, [[basidium|basidia]], and [[basidiospore]]s, surrounded by a hardened wall. They are commonly ''lenticular'' in shape (like a [[biconvex lens]]), measuring 1&ndash;3&nbsp;mm in diameter. The color of the peridioles is characteristic of the genera: ''Cyathus'' has black peridioles, ''Nidularia'' and ''Nidula'' have brown peridioles, ''Mycocalia'' has yellow- to red-brown peridioles, and ''Crucibulum'' has black peridioles that are surrounded by a whitish membrane called the tunica, which makes them appear white.<ref name=Lloyd1906>{{cite journal |author=Lloyd CG.|year=1906|title=The Nidulariaceae |journal=Mycological Writings |volume=2|pages=1\u201330}}</ref> In most species, the peridioles are dispersed by rain, but they may also be free in the peridium, surrounded by a jelly-like mucilage.<ref name=Cannon2008>{{cite book |vauthors=Cannon PF, Kirk PM |title=Fungal Families of the World |publisher=CABI|location=Wallingford |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0-85199-827-5}}</ref>\n\n; Microscopic characteristics\n\n[[Basidiospore]]s are oval or elliptical in shape, smooth, [[hyaline]], and thin-walled.<ref name=\"isbn0-916422-74-7\"/>\n\n[[File:Bird's_Nest_Fungi_from_the_Missouri_Ozarks.jpg|thumb|right|Bird's Nest Fungi from the Missouri Ozarks]]\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nSpecies in this family are [[cosmopolitan (distribution)|cosmopolitan]] in distribution, and are largely [[saprobic]], obtaining nutrition from the decomposition of wood and plant organic matter.\n\n==Life cycle==\n\nThe life cycle of the Nidulariaceae, which contains both [[haploid]] and [[diploid]] stages, is typical of [[taxa]] in the [[basidiomycetes]] that can reproduce both asexually (via [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] spores), or sexually (with [[meiosis]]). Like other wood-decay fungi, this life cycle may be considered as two functionally different phases: the vegetative stage for the spread of [[mycelia]], and the reproductive stage for the establishment of spore-producing structures, the fruiting bodies.<ref name=\"isbn3-540-32138-1\">{{cite book |author=Schmidt O.|title=Wood and Tree Fungi: Biology, Damage, Protection, and Use |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2006 |pages=10&ndash;11 |isbn=978-3-540-32138-5}}</ref>\n\nThe vegetative stage encompasses those phases of the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called [[hypha]]e, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are [[homokaryotic]], containing a single [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]] in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by [[mitosis]] and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different [[mating type|mating compatibility groups]] fuse with one another, they form a [[dikaryon|dikaryotic]] mycelia in a process called [[plasmogamy]]. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. The majority of ''Nidulariaceae'' species are [[saprobic]], so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of [[enzyme]]s that break down complex [[polysaccharide]]s (such as [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]]) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.<ref>Deacon pp. 231&ndash;34.</ref>\n\nAfter a period of time and under the appropriate environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruiting body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruiting bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the [[basidia]] upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce [[basidiospore]]s, each containing a single haploid nucleus.<ref>Deacon pp. 31&ndash;32.</ref> The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruiting bodies are produced is long-lasting, and will continue to produce successive generations of fruiting bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.\n\n==Spore dispersal==\nThe nests are \"splash-cups\".<ref>THE SPLASH-CUP DISPERSAL MECHANISM IN PLANTS, Harold J. Brodie, Canadian Journal of Botany, 1951, 29(3): 224-234, 10.1139/b51-022, [http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/b51-022#.VCyZGizn_IU]</ref> When a raindrop hits one at the right angle, the walls are shaped such that the eggs are expelled to about 1 m away from the cup in some species. Some species have a sticky trailing thread, a ''funicular cord'', attached to the peridiole. If that thread encounters a twig on its flight, the peridiole will swing around and wrap itself around the twig. The spores are thought to be ingested by herbivores and grow in their droppings to continue the life cycle.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Splash and grab: Biomechanics of peridiole ejection and function of the funicular cord in bird's nest fungi| journal=Fungal Biology|volume =117|issue= 10|year= 2013|pages =708\u2013714|first1=Maribeth O. |last1=Hassett|first2= Mark W.F. |last2=Fischer|first3= Zachary T. |last3=Sugawara|first4= Jessica |last4=Stolze-Rybczynski|first5= Nicholas P. |last5=Money|doi=10.1016/j.funbio.2013.07.008| pmid=24119409}}</ref>\n\n==Genera==\n\nThere are five [[genus (biology)|genera]] in the Nidulariaceae:\n\n;''[[Crucibulum]]''\nFruiting bodies light tan to cinnamon-colored, cup- or crucible-shaped, and typically 1.5\u201310&nbsp;mm wide by 5\u201312&nbsp;mm tall. \n;''[[Cyathus]]''\nFruiting bodies vase-, trumpet- or urn-shaped with dimensions of 4\u20138&nbsp;mm wide by 7\u201318&nbsp;mm tall.

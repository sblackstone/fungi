Commonly known as the '''dune brittlestem''', this [[agaric]] primarily grows on sand dunes near [[marram grass]], feeding [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophically]] on the decaying roots.  The season of growth is generally May to November.\n\n''P. ammophila''<!--the fungus as a whole, or just the visible mushroom?--> is variable in appearance, changing colour and shape during its lifespan.  Initially bell-shaped and tan or pale brown, the cap gradually flattens and darkens, becoming dark brown with a [[:File:Mushroom cap morphology2.png|depressed shape]] as it ages.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Psathyrella ammophila'' was first described in 1868 by [[Michel Charles Durieu de Maisonneuve]] and [[Joseph-Henri L\u00e9veill\u00e9]] in one of Durieu de Maisonneuve's publications on the flora and fauna of Algeria, ''Exploration scientifique de l'Alg\u00e9rie: Sciences naturelles, botanique''.  They gave it the scientific name ''Agaricus ammophilus''.  The species was identified and described a further five times under different names, until 1960, when the botanist [[P.D. Orton]] gave the definitive classification in the journal ''Transactions of the British Mycological Society'' (now ''[[Fungal Biology]]'').<ref name=\"Orton\"/>\n\nThe genus name ''Psathyrella'' is a diminutive form of ''Psathyra'', derived from the Greek word meaning \"friable\", ''psathuros'' (\u03c8\u03b1\u03b8\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2).  This name, like the common name brittlestem for many of the ''Psathyrella'' species, is related to the fragile nature of the cap and stem.  The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''ammophila'' originates from the Greek words ''ammos'' (\u1f04\u03bc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), meaning sand, and ''phillia'' (\u03d5\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2), meaning lover, a reference to the mushroom's sand dune habitat.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}\n\n==Description==\nTypically small- to medium-sized, ''P. ammophila'' is found growing singly or in small clumps near [[marram grass]].  The cap is a light clay-brown or tan when younger and about {{convert|1|to|4|cm|in|1}} in diameter.  Although the cap is generally smooth, it possesses microscopically tiny hairs and is often coated with sand particles.  The tissue is not [[hygrophanous]] and therefore does not change colour with moisture loss and absorption, but the mushrooms do darken to a dark brown as they age.  Cap shape begins as campanulate or convex, gradually flattening and possibly becoming depressed in shape.<ref name=\"first nature\"/><ref name=\"Jordan\"/><ref name=\"Pegler\"/>\n\nThe gills of ''P. ammophila'' are crowded and attached to the stem usually broadly (adnate) but occasionally narrowly (adnexed).  At a very young age they may be a pallid brown, but for most of the lifespan are dark brown, sometimes turning black.<ref name=\"first nature\"/><ref name=\"Jordan\"/><ref name=\"Pegler\"/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]/stem is light grey to pale brown and centrally attached to the cap.  The surface is smooth, sometimes with small vertical ridges.  It is deeply rooted in the substrate for feeding on the roots of marram grass and for stability in its sand dune habitat.  Above ground, its height is typically {{convert|3|to|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall and its diameter is slender, about {{convert|2|to|5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.  There is no ring.<ref name=\"first nature\"/><ref name=\"Jordan\"/><ref name=\"Pegler\"/>\n\nThe [[basidia]] bear four spores.  The spores are dark brown and smooth, ellipsoid in shape, and 10 to 11&nbsp;\u00b5m \u00d7 6 to 7&nbsp;\u00b5m.  There is a large [[germ pore]] on each spore.<ref name=\"Jordan\"/><ref name=\"Pegler\"/>\n\nFlesh of the cap and stem is pale, thin, and brittle.  Neither the taste nor the odour of the mushroom is distinctive, and it is considered inedible, though not particularly noted as being toxic.<ref name=\"Jordan\"/><ref name=\"Pegler\"/>\n\n''[[Conocybe dunensis]]'' is a similar species that is mainly differentiated from ''P. ammophila'' by the rust colour of its gills.<ref name=\"Pegler\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Psathyrella ammophila'' has a wide but sparse distribution throughout the European continent and in limited coastal locations outside Europe, with records of collection in Algeria, New Zealand, and Canada.  It can sometimes be found near the shoreline, inside the [[littoral zone]], but is most often encountered in more stable and established sand dunes and [[dune slack]]s inland.<ref name=\"first nature\"/><ref name=\"Rotheroe\"/>  The presence of [[marram grass]] nearby is a key aspect of its habitat, as it has a [[symbiotic]] (specifically, [[commensal]]) relationship with the plants, using their decaying roots as food.<ref name=\"first nature\"/><ref name=\"Jordan\"/><ref name=\"Pegler\"/>  The mushrooms grow singly or in clumps and are, to some degree, [[sympatric]] with the fly ''[[Delia albula]]''.  The [[fungivorous]] larvae of the fly develops in ''P. ammophila'' parasitically, though will also attack other fungi.<ref name=\"Stubbs\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Jordan\">{{cite book\n | last = Jordan\n | first = Michael\n | authorlink = Michael Jordan (mycologist)\n | title = The Encyclopaedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe\n | publisher = Frances Lincoln Ltd\n | year = 2004\n | page = 237\n | isbn = 9780711223790}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Orton\">{{cite journal\n | last = Orton\n | first = P.D.\n | authorlink = P.D.

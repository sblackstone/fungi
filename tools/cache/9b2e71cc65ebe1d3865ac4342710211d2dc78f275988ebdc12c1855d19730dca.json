Previously known as ''Coprinus atramentarius'', it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus ''[[Coprinus]]'' after ''[[Coprinus comatus|C.&nbsp;comatus]]''. It is a widespread and common [[fungus]] found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as [[land lot|vacant lots]] and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is [[poison]]ous when consumed with [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] \u2013 hence another common name, '''tippler's bane'''.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nThe common ink cap was first described by French naturalist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] in 1786 as ''Agaricus atramentarius'' before being placed in the large genus ''[[Coprinus]]'' in 1838 by [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''atramentum'' \"ink\".<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063005-8|page=72}}</ref>\n\nThe genus was formerly considered to be a large one with well over 100 species. However, [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular analysis]] of DNA sequences showed that most species belonged in the family [[Psathyrellaceae]], distinct from the [[type species]] that belonged to the [[Agaricaceae]]. It was given its current binomial name in 2001 as a result, as this and other species were moved to the new genus ''[[Coprinopsis]]''.<ref name=\"Red01\">{{cite journal|year=2001|title=''Coprinus'' Pers. and the disposition of ''Coprinus'' species ''sensu lato''.|journal=Taxon|volume=50|issue=1|pages=203\u201341|doi=10.2307/1224525|jstor=1224525|author1=Redhead, Scott A|author2=Vilgalys, Rytas|author3=Moncalvo, Jean-Marc|author4=Johnson, Jacqui|author5=Hopple, Jr. John S|publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT)}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"tippler's bane\" is derived from its ability to create acute sensitivity to alcohol, similar to [[disulfiram]] (Antabuse).<ref name=\"arora86\">{{cite book |last=Arora |first=David |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms demystified: a comprehensive guide to the fleshy fungi |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |pages=347\u201348 |authorlink=David Arora |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref> Other common names include common ink cap and inky cap.

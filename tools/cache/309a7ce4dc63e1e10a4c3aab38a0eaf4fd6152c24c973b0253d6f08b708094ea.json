A common and widely distributed species, it is found in North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and North America. It was first described scientifically by [[Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer]] in 1774 as an ''[[Agaricus]]'', and later transferred to the genus ''[[Lactarius]]'' in 1821 by [[Samuel Frederick Gray]]. A [[variety (botany)|variety]], ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' var. ''nordmanensis'', is known from the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' officially became the [[type species]] of ''Lactarius'' in 2011 after [[molecular phylogenetic|molecular]] studies prompted the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] reshuffling of species between several [[Russulaceae]] genera.\n\nA [[mycorrhiza]]l species, ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' associates with various trees, most commonly [[birch]], and its [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) grow on the ground singly or in groups in [[mixed forest]]s. The [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' mushrooms are convex with a central depression, and attain a diameter of up to {{convert|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. A blend of pink and [[ochre]] hues, the cap sometimes has concentric zones of alternating lighter and darker shades. The edge of the cap is rolled inward, and shaggy when young. On the underside of the cap are narrow flesh-colored [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that are crowded closely together. The cylindrical [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is a pale flesh color with a delicately downy surface and brittle [[trama (mycology)|flesh]]; it is up to {{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.6|\u2013|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. When cut or injured, the fruit bodies ooze a bitter white [[latex]] that does not change color upon exposure to air. The variety ''nordmanensis'', in contrast, has latex that changes from white to yellow. ''Lactarius torminosus'' can be distinguished from similar species like ''[[Lactarius pubescens|L.&nbsp;pubescens]]'' or ''[[Lactarius villosus|L.&nbsp;villosus]]'' by differences in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and coloration, or by microscopic characteristics like [[spore]] shape and size.\n\nAlthough it is valued for its peppery flavor and eaten after suitable preparation in Russia and Finland, the species is highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking. Studies have identified several chemicals present in the mushrooms, including [[ergosterol]] and [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] thereof, and the pungent-tasting [[velleral]].\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\nGerman naturalist [[Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer]] was the first to describe the species, placing it in ''Agaricus'' in 1774.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4ffer1774\"/> Seven years later in 1781, [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Jean Bulliard]] described a species he called ''Agaricus necator'' and illustrated it in the first volume of his ''Herbier de la France'';<ref name=Bulliard1781/> this name and the synonym ''Lactarius necator'', resulting from [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]]'s 1800 transfer<ref name=Persoon1800/> to ''Lactarius'', are both considered to refer to ''L.&nbsp;torminosus''.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Lactarius necator\"/> [[Otto Kuntze]], for his part chose to put it in ''Lactifluus'',<ref name=Kuntze1898/> while [[Paul Kummer]] thought ''Galorrheus''<ref name=Kummer1871/> was the appropriate placement; until the recent resurrection of ''Lactifluus'', both genera had been long considered to be unnecessary segregates of ''Lactarius''.<ref name=Buyck2010/> According to [[Index Fungorum]],<ref name=\"urlFungorum synonymy\"/> another synonym is [[Samuel Frederick Gray]]'s<ref name=Gray1821/> ''Lactarius necans''. Gray also gave the species its modern name when he transferred it to ''Lactarius'' in his 1821 ''Natural Arrangement of British Plants''.<ref name=\"urlFungorum synonymy\"/><ref name=Gray1821/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''torminosus'' means \"tormenting\" or \"causing colic\", in reference to the gastrointestinal distress associated with consuming the raw mushroom.<ref name=Roody2003/> Early English [[common name|vernacular]] names were Gray's \"bellyach milk-stool\" (1821),<ref name=Gray1821/> and [[James Edward Smith]]'s \"bearded pepper agaric\" (1824).<ref name=Smith1824/> More recent common names include \"shaggy milkcap\",<ref name=Dickinson1982/> \"powderpuff milkcap\",<ref name=McKnight1987/> \"pink-fringed milkcap\",<ref name=Arora1991/> \"bearded milkcap\",<ref name=Arora1986/> and the [[British Mycological Society]]-recommended \"woolly milkcap\".<ref name=BMS/>\n\nAccording to [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler|Hesler]] and [[Alexander H. Smith|Smith]]'s 1979 [[biological classification|classification]] of the genus ''[[Lactarius]]'', ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' belongs to [[subgenus]] ''Piperites'', [[section (biology)|section]] ''Piperites'' (in which it is the [[type species]]), subsection ''Piperites''. Species in this subsection are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow.<ref>Hesler and Smith (1979), [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/f/fung1tc/AAC3719.0001.001/249?rgn=full+text;view=image p. 237.]</ref> A 2004 [[phylogenetic]] analysis of European ''Lactarius'' species concluded that ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' falls into a [[clade|group]] that includes ''[[lactarius torminosulus|L.&nbsp;torminosulus]]'', and that these two species are [[sister group|closely related]] to a group that includes ''[[Lactarius tesquorum|L.&nbsp;tesquorum]]'', ''[[Lactarius scoticus|L.&nbsp;scoticus]]'', and ''[[Lactarius pubescens|L.&nbsp;pubescens]]''.<ref name=Nuytinck2004/>\n\nA multi-gene [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis published in 2008 demonstrated that species then distributed in the genera ''Lactarius'' and ''[[Russula]]'' actually consisted of four distinct [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]].<ref name=Buyck2008/> The subsequent reorganization of [[Russulaceae]] species\u2014a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] change needed to make ''Russula'' and ''Lactarius'' [[monophyletic]]\u2014required that a new type species be defined for ''Lactarius'', since the previous type, ''[[Lactarius piperatus|L.&nbsp;piperatus]]'', belonged to the clade that will be transferred to genus ''[[Lactifluus]]''. A proposal to [[conserved name|conserve]] ''Lactarius'' with ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' as the type was accepted by the Nomenclatural Committee for Fungi<ref name=Norvell2011/> and passed at the 2011 [[International Botanical Congress]].<ref name=Barrie2011/> The change minimizes \"taxonomic disruption\", allowing most of the common and well-known ''Lactarius'' species to retain their names.<ref name=Buyck2010/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Young Lactarius torminosus (cropped).JPG|left|thumb|200px|Young fruit body showing the tomentose cap margin and forked gills]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially convex, but as it matures the center forms a depression and the outer edges rise until it assumes the shape of a shallow funnel; its final width is typically between {{convert|2|and|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> The cap margin is strongly curled inward; when young, it is [[Trichome#Plant trichomes|tomentose]] (covered with a thick matting of hairs), forming a [[veil (botany)|veil]]-like structure that partly covers up the gills.<ref name=Arora1986/> This tomentum diminishes with age. The cap surface is at first similarly tomentose, but eventually the hairs wear off, leaving the surface more or less smooth.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> The surface starts off somewhat sticky with clear concentric rings of darker shade (a ''[[zonate]]'' pattern); these rings, especially the outer ones, usually fade in maturity.<ref name=McKnight1987/> The cap color is pinkish-orange to pale dull pink, becoming orange to whitish toward the margin as the pink gradually fades. The white to flesh-colored [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm and brittle, but becomes flaccid in age. The [[latex]] that is produced when the mushroom tissue is cut or injured is white to cream, and does not change color with prolonged exposure to air, nor does it stain the gills.

Their color is whitish, becoming pink-tinged, turning pale tan with age. The adult [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|1.5|\u2013|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|0.6|\u2013|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, fragile, more or less equal in width throughout, and cylindrical or narrowed at the base. Its surface is dry, and either smooth to [[Pruinescence|pruinose]] (covered with a very fine whitish powder on the surface). The color ranges from pale light pink to yellowish-tinged or slightly pinkish orange to orange white, sometimes spotted. The interior of the stem is firm, beige white, and filled with a soft pith, but it eventually becomes hollow.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> Occasionally, white [[mycelium]] is visible at the base of the stem where it meets the ground.<ref name=\"Bessette pp. 257-8\">Bessette ''et al''. (2009), pp. 257\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe fruit body [[Morphogenesis|formation]] of ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' is pileostipitocarpic. In this type of development, the [[hymenium]] forms early on the underside of the cap and upper stem of the mushroom [[primordium]]. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous [[hypha]]e that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering [[basidia]] and macrocystidia (very long [[cystidia]]) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.<ref name=Watling1985/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore print]] of ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' is cream to pale yellow, and the spores 8\u201310.2 by 5.8\u20136.6&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]], roughly spherical to broadly elliptical in side view, and [[hyaline]] (translucent). Only the ornamentation on their surface is [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]; it is partially reticulate (network-like) with interrupted ridges roughly 0.5\u20130.7&nbsp;\u03bcm high, and a few isolated warts. Spores have a conspicuous [[wikt:apiculus|apiculus]], demarcating where it was once attached to the basidia via the [[sterigma]]. The basidia are four-spored, hyaline and club-shaped to cylindrical, measuring 30\u201347.7 by 7.3\u20138.2&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>\n\n[[cystidium|Pleurocystidia]] are present only in the form of macrocystidia embedded and originating in the hymenium and just below it, they reach 40.3\u201380.0 by 5.1\u20139.5&nbsp;\u03bcm. Macrocystidia are abundant in the hymenium. Characterized by their spindle-shaped to [[wikt:ventricose|ventricose]] (swollen on one side) form that gradually tapers in width, they have [[granule (cell biology)|granular]] hyaline contents. Gill edge cystidia (cheilocystidia) are smaller: 30\u201352 by 4.5\u20138.0&nbsp;\u03bcm. The [[cap cuticle]] is made of gelatinized, interwoven hyphae arranged more or less parallel to the cap surface (a form known as ''ixocutis''); the thin-walled, threadlike hyphae of this layer are 2.5\u20137.3&nbsp;\u03bcm wide.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>\n\n===Variety ''nordmanensis''===\n''Lactarius nordmanensis'' was described by Alexander Smith in 1960 to account for a North American species closely resembling ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' in appearance, but with a slightly larger range of spore sizes (9\u201311 by 6.5\u20138&nbsp;\u03bcm). In contrast to the unchanging latex of ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'', ''L.&nbsp;nordmanensis'' has whitish latex that slowly changes to pale yellow upon exposure to air; the latex also stains mushroom tissues and paper yellow.<ref name=Smith1960/> Hesler and Smith reduced ''L.&nbsp;nordmanensis'' to the status of a [[variety (botany)|variety]] under ''L.&nbsp;torminosus'' in 1979.<ref name=\"S&H pp.277-8\"/> ''Lactarius torminosus'' var. ''nordmanensis'' has been recorded from [[California]],<ref name=Methven1985/> [[Idaho]], [[Michigan]], and [[Wisconsin]] in the United States, [[Quebec]] in Canada, and Switzerland.

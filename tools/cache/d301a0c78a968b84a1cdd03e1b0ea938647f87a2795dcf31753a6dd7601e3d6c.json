These waxcaps are found across the [[Northern Hemisphere]] from [[China]] and [[Japan]] to [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. The small bright red mushroom is a familiar sight in unimproved grasslands in Europe in late summer and autumn, and woodlands in North America in winter.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe scarlet hood was first described as ''Agaricus coccineus'' by German [[mycology|mycologist]] [[Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer]] in 1774, before being transferred to the genus ''[[Hygrophorus]]'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838, and finally ''[[Hygrocybe]]'' by [[Paul Kummer]] in 1871. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''coccinea'' is [[Latin]] for \"scarlet\".\n\n==Description==\nA small waxcap with an initially bell-shaped, and later flattening, [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] 2\u20135&nbsp;cm (\u00be\u20132 in) across, scarlet in colour and slimy in texture. The adnate gills are thick and widely spaced, yellow red in colour. The [[spore print]] is white. The ringless [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is up 2\u20135&nbsp;cm (\u00be-2 in) high and 0.3\u20131&nbsp;cm (\u215b-\u2153 in) wide, red with a yellowish base. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is yellowish-red and the smell and taste faint. The oval [[basidospore|spores]] measure 7\u20139.5 x 4\u20135 [[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=Nilper77/><ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Phillips R | year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms | page = 75 | publisher = Pan MacMillan|location=London | isbn = 978-0-330-44237-4}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Hygrocybe coccinea'' has a wide distribution in unimproved grasslands across Europe from August to October.<ref name=Nilper77>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-063006-0|page= 22}}</ref> In Britain, like all Hygrocybes, it has its best seasons in frost-free late autumn months, and in western North America it may be found under [[Coast Redwood|redwood]]s or in mixed woodland in winter.<ref name=\"arora86\">{{cite book |last=Arora |first=David |authorlink=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms demystified: a comprehensive guide to the fleshy fungi |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |pages=114 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref> It has been recorded growing under ''[[Rhododendron]]'' and oak (''[[Quercus]]'') in [[Sagarmatha National Park]] in [[Nepal]], and also occurs in [[India]], China and Japan.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giri A, Rana P|date=June 2007|title=Some Higher Fungi from Sagarmatha National Park (SNP) and its adjoining areas, Nepal|journal=Scientific World |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=67\u201374 |doi=10.3126/sw.v5i5.2659}}</ref>\n\nSpecimens initially identified as ''H.&nbsp;coccinea'' in [[Australia]] have been reclassified as ''[[Hygrocybe miniata|H.&nbsp;miniata]]'' or ''[[Hygrocybe kandora|H.&nbsp;kandora]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author= Young, A.M. | year =2005 | title = Fungi of Australia: Hygrophoraceae | publisher = (Australian Biological Resources Study) CSIRO, Canberra, ACT | isbn = 978-0-643-09195-5|page= 148}}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nThe scarlet hood is [[edible mushroom|edible]],<ref name=Phillips06/> but of fairly little interest.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Hygrocybe species|List of ''Hygrocybe'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q39528}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hygrocybe Coccinea}}\n[[Category:Hygrocybe|Coccinea]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1774]]"}]}}}}

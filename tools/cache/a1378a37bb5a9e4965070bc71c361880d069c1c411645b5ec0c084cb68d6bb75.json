Domestic production of matsutake in Japan has been sharply reduced over the last 50 years due to the pine-killing [[nematode]] ''[[Bursaphelenchus xylophilus]]'', which has influenced the price a great deal.  The annual harvest of matsutake in Japan is now less than 1,000 tons, and the Japanese mushroom supply is largely made up by imports from [[China]], [[Korea]], the [[North America]]n [[Pacific Northwest]] ([[Northern California]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[British Columbia]]), and [[Northern Europe]] ([[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Norway]]).<ref>{{ja icon}} [http://www.j-cast.com/2007/09/26011666.html \u8f38\u5165\u30de\u30c4\u30bf\u30b1\u306b\u7570\u5909\u3000\u4e2d\u56fd\u7523\u6fc0\u6e1b\u3001\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u53c2\u6226], J-CAST, 2007/9/26.</ref>  The price for matsutake in the Japanese market is highly dependent on quality, availability, and origin.

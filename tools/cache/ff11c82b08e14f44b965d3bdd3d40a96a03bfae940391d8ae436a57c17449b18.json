After cutting, the yellow interior quickly turns blue due to oxidation.]]'''''Neoboletus luridiformis''''' is a large solid fungus with a bay-brown hemispherical to convex [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] that can grow up to {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} wide, and is quite felty initially. It has small orange-red pores that become rusty with age, and bruise blue to black. The tubes are yellowish-green, and become blue quickly on cutting. The fat, colourful, densely red-dotted yellow [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is 4&ndash;12&nbsp;cm (2&ndash;5 in) high, and has '''no network pattern''' (reticulation). The flesh stains dark blue when bruised; broken, or cut.<ref name=Phillips06/> There is little smell. The spore dust is olive greenish-brown.\n\nThe similar ''[[Suillellus luridus]]'' has a network pattern on the stem, and seems to prefer chalky soil. ''Rubroboletus satanas'' also has a stem network, but a very-pale whitish cap.\n''[[Rubroboletus pulcherrimus]]'' has a reticulate stipe, and is larger in size.<ref name=\"Desjardin 2015\">{{cite book |author=Desjarind D.E, Wood M.G, Stevens F.A. |title=California Mushrooms.

It is often found in the same places as ''[[Boletus edulis]]''. It is also widely distributed in [[North America]], and is especially common under [[spruce]] in its range from Northern [[California]] to [[Alaska]]. In Eastern North America it grows with both soft, and hardwood trees.<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref> It seems to prefer acid soils.\n\n==Toxicity and edibility==\nMild tasting, ''Neoboletus luridiformis'' is edible after longer cooking (some literature recommends 20 minutes). It is commonly collected in several European countries. \n\nWhen raw or insufficiently cooked it can cause gastric upset, for the same reason it is not recommended for drying. Caution is advised as it resembles other less edible blue-staining boletes, and should thus be avoided by novice mushroom hunters.<ref name=\"Arora2nd\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Vizzini 2014\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gelardi M, Simonini G, Vizzini A |title=Nomenclatural novelties |journal=Index Fungorum |issue=192 |date=October 17, 2014 |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Publications/Index%20Fungorum%20no.192.pdf}}</ref>\n\n}}\n*{{cite book | author = Phillips R | year = 1985 | title = Mushrooms and other fungi of Great Britain and Europe| publisher = pan Books | isbn = 978-0-330-26441-9}}\n* {{cite book|author=Zeitlmayr L|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms:An Illustrated Handbook|publisher=garden City Press, Hertfordshire|isbn=978-0-584-10324-3}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q728666|from2=Q26203718}}\n\n[[Category:Neoboletus|luridiformis]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1844]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]"}]}}}}

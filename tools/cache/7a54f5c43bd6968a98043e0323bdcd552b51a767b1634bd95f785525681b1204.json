It is widely distributed and common in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It has a rusty orange spore print and a bitter taste and contains the hallucinogen [[psilocybin]]. It was given its current name by mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Singer R. |year=1951 |title=The Agaricales in modern taxonomy |journal=Lilloa |volume=22 |issue= |page=560}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n===Cap===\nThe cap is (2) 5\u201315&nbsp;cm (23) across, convex with an incurved margin and expands to broadly convex to almost plane in age. The top is dry, fibrillose, and scaly, often with a blueish-green tinge when young. The color is variable, often with various bluish green, pink, or [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] patches. The cap is sometimes cracked in age. The flesh is pallid to whitish, sometimes turning buff or pinkish-buff in age. The scales are tawny or reddish becoming dark brown.\n\n===Gills===\nThe [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are close or crowded, and broad. They are buff to yellow-orange or ochre, and [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] to [[wikt:adnate|adnate]]. They are at first slightly [[Lamella (mycology)|decurrent]], often seceding. The edges are even to slightly rough.\n\n===Spores===\nSpores are 6\u20149&nbsp;\u00b5m by 3.5\u20144.5&nbsp;\u00b5m and have no [[germ pore]]. They are roughened and elliptical. [[Pleurocystidia]] are rare and clamp connections are present. The basidia each have four spore. ''Gymnopilus aeruginosus'' has a rusty to rusty-orange or rusty-cinnamon [[spore print]].\n\n===Stipe===\nThe stipe is (3) 5 \u2013  12&nbsp;cm long, (0.4) 1.0 \u2014  1.5&nbsp;cm (4) thick, and has a more or less equal structure. It is covered with [[wikt:appressed|appressed]] fibrils, soon disappearing. It is smooth, dry, dusted with rusty orange spores and has a cottony, scanty, yellowish, partially fibrillose veil that leaves an evanescent zone of hairs near the apex of the stipe. It is colored more or less like the cap; it is flesh whitish, tinged greenish or bluish green,  becoming yellowish or pinkish brown when dry. It is solid but becomes hollow, and is sometimes striated.\n\n==Habitat and formation==\n\n''Gymnopilus aeruginosus'' grows gregariously to cespitosely on stumps, logs, and woodchip mulch/sawdust on hardwood and conifers; ''Gymnopilus aeruginosus'' grows in spring, fall, and winter, common in the [[Pacific Northwest]], it also grows in some of the southern states of the United States, such as [[Tennessee]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  It is also found in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]].<ref>[Occurrences of ''Gymnopilus eruginosus'' ([data.gbif.org])]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Gymnopilus species|List of ''Gymnopilus'' species]]\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Stamets | year=1996 | title=Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World | publisher=Ten Speed Press | location=Berkley | isbn=0-9610798-0-0}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5973~gid~.asp Rogers Mushrooms - Gymnopilus aeruginosus]\n*  {{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.2307/3761920 \n| last1 = Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos | first1 = Laura \n| last2 = Mueller | first2 = Gregory M. \n| last3 = Cifuentes | first3 = Joaqu\u00edn \n| last4 = Miller | first4 = Andrew N. \n| last5 = Santerre | first5 = Anne \n| title = Traditional infrageneric classification of Gymnopilus is not supported by ribosomal DNA sequence data \n| journal = Mycologia \n| volume = 95 \n| issue = 6 \n| pages = 1204\u20131214 \n|date=Nov\u2013Dec 2003\n| pmid = 21149021\n| jstor = 3761920\n| url = http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/reprint/95/6/1204.pdf <!-- alternate URL: http://files.shroomery.org/attachments/7243261-PHYLOGENYOFGYMNOPILUSWITHDNADATA.pdf -->\n}}\n\n{{Hallucinogenic mushrooms}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q4387845}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gymnopilus Aeruginosus}}\n[[Category:Gymnopilus|aeruginosus]]\n[[Category:Entheogens]]\n[[Category:Psychoactive fungi]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic tryptamine carriers]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Charles Horton Peck]]"}]}}}}

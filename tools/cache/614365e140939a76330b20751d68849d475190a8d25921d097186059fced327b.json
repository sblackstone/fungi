[[Ascocarp|Fruit bodies]] have small, bright red cups up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide atop a slender whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] that is between {{convert|1|to|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long. A [[saprobic]] species, it is found growing on [[hardwood]] twigs, particularly those that are partially buried in moist and shaded [[humus]]-rich soil. The fungus is distributed in the continental United States east of the [[Rocky Mountain]]s, Central America, the Caribbean, and Asia. It is distinguished from the related species ''[[Sarcoscypha coccinea|S.&nbsp;coccinea]]'' and ''[[Sarcoscypha austriaca|S.&nbsp;austriaca]]'' by differences in geographical distribution, fruiting season, and fruit body structure. [[Phylogenetic]] analysis has shown that it is most closely related to other ''Sarcoscypha'' species that contain large oil droplets in their [[spore]]s. The species ''Molliardiomyces occidentalis'' is an [[imperfect fungi|imperfect]] form of the fungus that lacks a [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproductive]] stage in its [[biological life cycle|life cycle]].\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe fungus, originally collected from [[Muskingum County, Ohio]], was named ''Peziza occidentalis'' by [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]] in 1832.<ref name=Schweinitz1832/> It was assigned its current name by  [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] in 1888.<ref name=Saccardo1888/> [[Andrew Price Morgan]] renamed the species ''Geopyxis occidentalis'' in 1902 because of a perceived similarity with ''[[Geopyxis hesperidea]]'',<ref name=Morgan1902/> but the name change was not adopted by subsequent authors. In 1928, [[Fred Jay Seaver]] overturned Saccardo's naming and applied the name ''Plectania'' to ''Sarcoscypha coccinea'' and other red cup fungi.<ref name=Seaver1928/> In later [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] revisions, [[Richard P. Korf]] reinstated the genus name ''[[Sarcoscypha]]''.<ref name=Korf1953/><ref name=Korf1972/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''occidentalis'', derived from the [[Latin]] word for \"western\", may refer to the distribution of the species in the [[western hemisphere]]. It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the stalked scarlet cup<ref name=Roody2003/> or the western scarlet cup.<ref name=McKnight1987/>\n\n==Phylogeny==\n\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n| clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n| label1=\n| 1={{clade\n     |1=''[[Sarcoscypha coccinea|S. coccinea]]'' and four other ''Sarcoscypha'' spp.\n     |2={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n           |1={{clade\n              |1=''[[Sarcoscypha korfiana|S. korfiana]]''\n              |2={{clade\n                 |1='''''S. occidentalis'''''\n                 |2=''[[Sarcoscypha mesocyatha|S. mesocyatha]]''\n                }}\n              }}\n         |2={{clade\n            |1={{clade\n               |1=''[[Sarcoscypha dudleyi|S. dudleyi]]''\n               |2=''[[Sarcoscypha emarginata|S. emarginata]]''\n              }}\n            |2=''[[Sarcoscypha hosoyae|S. hosoyae]]''\n           }}\n        }}\n}}}}}}\n| caption=Phylogeny and relationships of ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' and related species based on [[internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] sequences and [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics.<ref name=Harrington1998/>}}\nThe [[phylogenetic]] relationships in the genus ''Sarcoscypha'' were analyzed by Francis Harrington in the late 1990s.<ref name=Harrington1998/><ref name=Harrington1997/> The [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis combined comparison of [[DNA sequence|sequences]] from the [[internal transcribed spacer]] in the non-functional [[RNA]] with fifteen traditional [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characters, such as [[spore]] features, fruit body shape, and degree of hair curliness. Based on this analysis, ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' is part of a [[clade]] of evolutionarily related taxa that includes the species ''[[Sarcoscypha dudleyi|S.&nbsp;dudleyi]]'', ''[[Sarcoscypha emarginata|S.&nbsp;emarginata]]'', ''[[Sarcoscypha hosoyae|S.&nbsp;hosoyae]]'', ''[[Sarcoscypha korfiana|S.&nbsp;korfiana]]'' and ''[[Sarcoscypha mesocyatha|S.&nbsp;mesocyatha]]''.<ref name=Harrington1998/> All of these species contain large oil droplets in their spores, in contrast to the other major clade of ''Sarcoscypha'' (containing the [[type species]] ''S.&nbsp;coccinea''), characterized by having smaller, more numerous droplets.<ref name=Harrington1997/> The species most closely related to ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' is ''S.&nbsp;mesocyatha'', known only from [[Hawaii]].<ref name=Hemmes2002/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Sarcoscypha occidentalis 45258.jpg|thumb|left|''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' grows on sticks and twigs.]]\nDepending on their age, the fruit bodies of ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' may range in shape from deep cups to saucers to discs in maturity, and they can reach diameters up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. In young specimens, the edges of the cup are curled inwards, and crenulate (with small rounded scallops); the cup edges in older specimens become laciniate (with jagged edges cut into irregular segments). The cups rest atop a [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] that is small to medium-sized, up to {{convert|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and 1.5\u20132&nbsp;mm thick,<ref name=Harrington1990/> and attached centrally or to the side to the underside of the cup. The base of the stem may be covered with translucent \"hairs\".<ref name=Kanouse1948/> The fertile [[spore]]-bearing inner surface of the cups, the [[hymenium]], is bright red but fades to yellow or orange when dry. It is smooth or becomes so with time.<ref name=Denison1972/> The fruit bodies are fleshy to rubbery when fresh, but become leathery when dry.<ref name=Harrington1990/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and has no distinctive odor or taste. ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' is \"of no culinary value\".<ref name=Roody2003/> A Jamaican [[variety (botany)|variety]] has been named (as ''Plectania occidentalis'' var. ''jamaicensis''); it has a pinker hymenium.<ref name=Dennis1954/>\n\n[[File:Sarcoscypha occidentalis 523786.jpg|thumb|right|Micrograph of spores and asci]]\n''Exipulum'' is a term used to refer to the tissue or tissues containing the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20\u201330&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] thickness), made of a tissue type known as ''texura porrecta'', consisting of more or less parallel [[hypha]]e all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200\u2013600&nbsp;\u00b5m) and made of ''textura intricata'', a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The [[ascus|asci]] (filamentous structures in which the [[ascospore]]s develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240\u2013280 by 12\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19\u201322 by 10\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The [[paraphyses]] (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2\u20133&nbsp;\u00b5m thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes [[anastomosis|anastomose]], but do not form a conspicuous network.<ref name=Denison1972/> The paraphyses contain numerous red [[granule (cell biology)|granules]].<ref name=Healy2008/>\n\n===Anamorph form===\nAnamorphic or [[fungi imperfecti|imperfect fungi]] are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]], and typically reproduce by the process of [[mitosis]] in structures called [[conidium|conidia]]. In some cases, the sexual stage\u2014or [[teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]] stage\u2014is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' is ''Molliardiomyces occidentalis'', described by [[John W. Paden]]. This form produces smooth, colorless [[conidiophore]]s (specialized stalks that bear [[conidia]]) measuring 20\u2013230 by 2\u20133.2&nbsp;\u00b5m. The conidia are roughly spherical to [[wikt:ovoid|ovoid]], smooth, translucent ([[hyaline]]), and 4.6\u20137.0 by 3.0\u20133.8&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Paden1984/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Microstoma floccosum 13099.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = <center>''Microstoma floccosum''</center>\n| image2 = Scutellinia scutellata Dan Molter crop.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = <center>''Scutellinia scutellata''</center>\n| footer = \n}}\n''Sarcoscypha occidentalis'' is frequently confused with ''[[Sarcoscypha coccinea|S.&nbsp;coccinea]]'', but is distinguished macroscopically from this species by its smaller fruit bodies, smaller spores, and less hairy exterior. The two also differ in seasonal and geographic distribution: ''S.&nbsp;coccinea'' fruits earlier in the year, and is distributed in eastern North America, in the midwest, in the valleys between the Pacific coast and the Sierras and Cascades, as well as Europe, Africa, Australia, and India.<ref name=Denison1972/> Another eastern North American species, ''[[Sarcoscypha austriaca|S.&nbsp;austriaca]]'', has scarlet fruit bodies up to {{convert|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, and fruits in the early spring.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' may also be mistaken for ''[[Microstoma floccosum]]'', which occurs in the same habitat. ''M.&nbsp;floccosum'', however, has taller cups and is covered with stiff white hairs.<ref name=Seaver1904/> Another cup-fungus, ''[[Scutellinia scutellata]]'', is disc-shaped without a stem, and is fringed with black hairs around its rim.<ref name=Roody2003/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\nAs a [[saprobic]] fungus, ''Sarcoscypha occidentalis'' is part of a community of fungi that play an important role in the forest ecosystem by breaking down the complex insoluble molecules [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]] of wood and leaf litter into smaller [[oligosaccharide]]s that may be used by a variety of microbes.<ref name=Edwards2008/> Fruit bodies of ''S.&nbsp;coccinea'' may grow either solitarily, scattered or grouped together on sticks, twigs, and fragments of dead wood,<ref name=Denison1972/> usually somewhat decomposed and partially buried in the top {{convert|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} of soil and forest litter. It prefers soil that is moist and shaded and has a high content of [[humus]]. Like all ''Sarcoscypha'' species, it prefers the wood of [[angiosperm]]s, such as [[oak]], [[maple]], and [[basswood]];<ref name=Harrington1990/> one field guide notes a preference for [[shagbark hickory]].<ref name=Healy2008/> In the United States, it fruits from late spring to early autumn, which contrasts it with ''S.&nbsp;coccinea'', found usually in the spring.<ref name=Harrington1990/>\n\nThe fungus is found in North America east of the [[Rocky Mountains]], and at higher elevations in [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]].<ref name=Denison1972/> It has also been collected in Japan<ref name=Nagao2002/> and Taiwan.<ref name=Liou1977/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Denison1972>{{cite journal |author=Denison WC. |year=1972 |title=Central American Pezizales.

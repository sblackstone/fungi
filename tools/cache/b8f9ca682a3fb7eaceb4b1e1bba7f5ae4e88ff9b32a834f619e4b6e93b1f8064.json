Distinctive features of this species are found in its medium-sized, dark violet [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and slender [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] that are about {{convert|30|to|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. Microscopic characteristics include the amyloid [[spore]]s (staining when treated with [[Melzer's reagent]]), the club-shaped cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) that are covered with one or more, knob-like, apical protuberances, the absence of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), and the cylindrical, [[diverticulum|diverticulate]] caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem).\n\n==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==\nThe mushroom was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 2000, and, along with seven other ''Mycena'' species, was reported as a new species in a 2007 publication. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''clari-'' (meaning \"clear\") and ''violacea'' (\"[[wikt:violaceous|violaceous]]\"). The Japanese name is ''Shikon-sakuratake'' (\u30b7\u30b3\u30f3\u30b5\u30af\u30e9\u30bf\u30b1).<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\nAccording to Takahashi, the amyloid spores, the cheilocystidia covered with one or more, knob-like, apical excrescences, the diverticulate elements in the cortical layer of [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and the diverticulate caulocystidia suggest that the species is best [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Fragilipedes'', as defined by the Dutch ''Mycena'' specialist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus|Maas Geesteranus]].<ref name=Takahaski2007/><ref name=MaasGeesteranus1980/>\n\n==Description==\n\nDepending on the age of the mushroom, the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] can range in shape from conic to convex to bell-shaped to somewhat flattened in age; it reaches {{convert|10|to|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. It is sometimes shallowly [[wikt:umbilicate|umbilicate]] (with a small depression like a navel), radially grooved almost to the center, and somewhat [[hygrophanous]] (changing color as it loses or absorbs water). The cap surface is dry, and [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (covered with what appears to be a fine white powder), but this soon sloughs off, leaving the surface smooth. Initially, the cap color is dark violet, but it later fades to grayish-violet around the edges. The whitish [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to 0.5&nbsp;mm thick, and lacks any distinctive taste or odor. The slender [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|30|to|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|to|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, centrally attached to the stem, and hollow. Its surface is dry, pruinose over the entire length, and grayish-violet to dark violet in color. The base is covered with a white mycelial [[wikt:tomentum|tomentum]] (a hairy covering of short, closely matted hairs). The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate (fused to the stem), and distantly spaced, with about 15\u201319 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to {{convert|2.5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad, thin, and the same color as the cap or paler.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spores]] are broadly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, colorless, [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] ([[staining]] bluish to blue-black when treated with [[Melzer's reagent]]), thin-walled, and measure 8\u20139 by 5\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The [[basidia]] are 40\u201360 by 10\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are abundant, club-shaped, and measure 30\u201345 by 10\u201317&nbsp;\u00b5m. Their tips are covered with one or more, knob-like short excrescences that are colorless and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] tissue (tissue of the [[hymenium]]-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 12\u201321&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical (but often somewhat inflated), smooth, and contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment. These hyphae are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are smooth, or can be covered with scattered, warty or finger-like thin-walled [[diverticulum|diverticulae]] that are colorless or pale brownish, and dextrinoid. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap cuticle is parallel, cylindrical, hyaline or brownish, and dextrinoid; it has short and inflated cells that are up to 48&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and similar to the hyphae of the cap cuticle. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are 45\u201388 by 5\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m, cylindrical, diverticulate, colorless or brownish, and thin-walled. The flesh of the stem is composed of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 8\u201325&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the cap cuticle, the stem cuticle, the gill flesh, and at the basal [[septum|septa]] of the basidia.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''Mycena clariviolacea'' is similar to the Brazilian species ''[[Mycena cerasina|M.&nbsp;cerasina]]'' and the European ''[[Mycena diosma|M.&nbsp;diosma]]''. ''Mycena cerasina'', which belongs in the section ''Cerasinae'' of the genus ''Mycena'', differs in having a grayish-purple cap and stem, and forming somewhat [[wikt:utriform|utriform]] ([[wineskin]]-shaped) to [[wikt:lageniform|lageniform]] (flask-shaped), smooth cheilocystidia. ''Mycena diosma'', classified in the section ''Calodontes'', subsection ''Purae'', may be distinguished microscopically from ''M.&nbsp;clariviolacea'' by its smooth, spindle-shaped cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia, and nondiverticulate hyphae in the cortical layer of cap and stem.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Mycena clariviolacea'' is known only from [[Kanagawa]], Japan. Fruit bodies are found growing solitary or scattered, on dead fallen twigs in forests that are dominated by [[oak]] and [[Castanopsis|chinquapin]] trees. The mushroom fruits from June to September.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Fungorum>{{cite web |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=532054 |title=Index Fungorum \u2013 Names Record |publisher=CAB International |work= |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=MaasGeesteranus1980>{{cite journal |author=Maas Geesteranus RA. |title=Studies in Mycenas 15.

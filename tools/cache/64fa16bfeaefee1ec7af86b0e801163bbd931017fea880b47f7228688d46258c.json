The [[fruit bodies]] are dark purple [[mushroom]]s with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across, sporting [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]] underneath. The [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] measures {{convert|6|to|12|cm|in|frac=3}} by {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|frac=8}}, sometimes with a thicker base. The dark [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] has a smell reminiscent of [[cedar wood]]. Forming [[symbiotic]] ([[ectomycorrhizal]]) relationships with the roots of various plant species, ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' is found predominantly in [[conifer forest]]s in North America and [[deciduous forest]]s in Europe.\n\nThough they are [[edible mushroom|edible]], the appearance of these mushrooms is more distinctive than their taste. The species was first [[species description|described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753, and has undergone several name changes. It is the [[type species]] of the genus ''Cortinarius'', but is readily distinguished from other species in the genus by its dark colouration and distinct [[cystidia]]. There are some populations that seem to prefer [[deciduous]] trees and others that prefer [[pine]]s, but no [[genetic divergence]] between the two has been found. When identified as [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] separate from the deciduous-preferring populations, the pine-preferring populations have been referred to either as a separate species, ''C.&nbsp;hercynicus'', or as a [[subspecies]], ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' ssp. ''hercynicus''. Other populations once identified as ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' or close to that species have now been described as new and separate species, such as ''[[Cortinarius palatinus|C.&nbsp;palatinus]]'', ''[[Cortinarius neotropicus|C.&nbsp;neotropicus]]'', ''[[Cortinarius altissimus|C.&nbsp;altissimus]]'', ''[[Cortinarius kioloensis|C. kioloensis]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius hallowellensis|C.&nbsp;hallowellensis]]''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Agaricus violaceus'' was one of the few fungal species named by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1753 work ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.<ref>{{cite book| author=Linnaeus C| authorlink=Carl Linnaeus| title=Species Plantarum| publisher=Laurentii Salvii| location=Stockholm, Sweden| year=1753| chapter=Tomus&nbsp;II| url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/359194| page=1173| language=la| access-date=2018-02-21| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015162934/https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/359194| archive-date=2017-10-15| url-status=live}}</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''violaceus'' refers to the deep violet colour of its cap.<ref name=Weber/> In English, it is [[common name|commonly known]] as the violet webcap,<ref name=\"Phillips 2006\"/> or violet cort.<ref name=\"Bessette 1997\"/> French naturalist [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] viewed it as a [[variety (taxonomy)|variety]] (''violaceus'') of a variable species he described as ''Amanita araneosa'' in 1783,<ref name=lamarck1783/> and [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] placed it in the [[Section (botany)|Section]] ''Cortinaria'' of ''Agaricus'' in his 1801 work ''Synopsis Methodica Fungorum''.<ref name=Persoon1801/> ''Cortinarius'' was established as a genus by English botanist [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] in the first volume of his 1821 work ''A Natural Arrangement of British Plants'', where the species was recorded as ''Cortinaria violacea'', \"the violet curtain-stool\".<ref name=\"Gray 1821\"/>\n\nThe starting date of fungal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] had been set as 1&nbsp;January 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of the \"father of mycology\", the Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]], which meant the name ''Cortinarius violaceus'' required [[sanctioned name|sanction]] by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid. Thus the species was written as ''Cortinarius violaceus'' (L.: Fr.) Gray. However, a 1987 revision of the ''[[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]'' set the starting date at 1&nbsp;May 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's ''Species Plantarum''.<ref name=Esser1994/> Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries's authority, and is thus written as ''Cortinarius violaceus'' (L.) Gray.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Cortinarius violaceus\"/>\n\nGerman botanist [[Friedrich Otto W\u00fcnsche]] described the species as ''Inoloma violaceum'' in 1877. In 1891, his countryman [[Otto Kuntze]] published ''[[Revisio Generum Plantarum]]'', his response to what he perceived as a poor method in existing nomenclatural practice.<ref name=\"Kuntze\"/> He called the violet webcap ''Gomphos violaceus'' in 1898.<ref name=\"Kuntze 1898\"/> However, Kuntze's revisionary programme was not accepted by the majority of biologists.<ref name=\"Kuntze\"/>\n\n''Cortinarius violaceus'' was designated as the [[type species]] for the genus ''Cortinarius'' by [[Frederic Clements]] and [[Cornelius Lott Shear]] in their 1931 work ''The Genera of Fungi''.<ref name=clements1931/> [[Mycologist]] [[David Arora]] considers this odd, due to the mushroom's unusual colour and [[Cystidium|cystidia]]. Because of this designation, if ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' were to be split from the rest of the current genus, then, according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, it would retain the name ''Cortinarius'', while the other species would have to be reclassified.<ref name=Arora/> The species was one of only two placed in the ''Cortinarius'' subgenus ''Cortinarius'' by the Austrian mycologist [[Meinhard Michael Moser|Meinhard Moser]].<ref name=\"Phillips 2006\"/> [[molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] investigation of webcaps worldwide has increased this number to at least twelve.<ref name=\"Harrower E 2015\"/>\n\nA 2015 genetic study by evolutionary biologist Emma Harrower and colleagues of ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' and its closest relatives suggests that the group (section ''Cortinarius'') originated in Australasia and began [[Genetic divergence|diverging]] from a common ancestor around twelve million years ago in the [[Miocene]], with ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' itself diverging from its closest relative around 3.9 million years ago. The fact that these species diverged relatively recently indicates that some form of dispersal must have taken place across large bodies of water. The original plant hosts were flowering plants ([[angiosperm]]s), and ''C.&nbsp;violaceus''\u2014or its direct ancestor\u2014developed a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with pines, as well as multiple flowering plants; this may have facilitated its expansion across the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"Harrower E 2015older\"/>\n\nSome mycologists classify ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' as two distinct species\u2014''Cortinarius violaceus'' and ''Cortinarius hercynicus'', with ''hercynicus'' relating to the [[Hercynian Forest]] region of southern Germany. These species are differentiated [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] by the latter population's rounder [[basidiospore|spores]].<ref name=Arora/> Persoon had described ''C.&nbsp;hercynicus'' as a separate species in 1794, though Fries regarded it as conspecific with ''C.&nbsp;violaceus''.<ref name=\"Fries 1838\"/> Moser separated them once again as species in 1967, and Norwegian biologist Tor Erik Brandrud classified ''C.&nbsp;hercynicus'' as a [[subspecies]] of ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' in 1983.<ref name=brandrud1983/> However, Harrower and colleagues, on limited molecular testing, found no genetic or ecological difference between the two [[taxon|taxa]].<ref name=\"Harrower E 2015\"/>\n\nSome fungal populations around the world that have been classified as ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' have been found to belong to separate [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]] and hence reclassified as new species within section ''Cortinarius''.<ref name=\"Harrower E 2015older\"/> Two separate lineages discovered in populations from Costa Rica have been renamed ''[[Cortinarius palatinus]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius neotropicus|C.&nbsp;neotropicus]]'',<ref name=nybg/> one from Guyana\u2014described as [[sp. aff.]] ''violaceus''\u2014has become ''[[Cortinarius altissimus|C.&nbsp;altissimus]]'', and another from Western Australia and [[Tasmania]] described as both ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' and sp. aff. ''violaceus'' has become ''[[Cortinarius hallowellensis|C.&nbsp;hallowellensis]]''. Yet another from Eastern Australia has been named ''[[Cortinarius kioloensis|C. kioloensis]]''.<ref name=\"Harrower E 2015\"/> The poorly known species ''[[Cortinarius subcalyptrosporus]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius atroviolaceus]]'' from [[Borneo]] are almost indistinguishable from ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' outside of hard-to-observe spore detail\u2014the former has smaller spores with a detached perisporium (outer layer) and the latter has smaller spores and fruiting bodies.<ref name=moser86/> Another population, known from Borneo, [[New Guinea]] and New Zealand, was ascribed to ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' by Moser. It was noted as very similar to the original species concept of ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'',<ref name=moser86/> and awaits description as a new species after a phylogenetic study revealed it to represent a distinct taxon.<ref name=\"Harrower E 2015older\"/>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | header = \n | image1 = Cortinarius violaceus (L.)

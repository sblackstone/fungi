The variety ''ardosiacum'', described by Italian mycologist [[Giacomo Bresadola]], has a dark blue-grey cap.\n\n==Description==\n''Tricholoma saponaceum'' has a convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with a vague [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] up to {{convert|9|or|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} across, which flattens with age. The colour is highly variable, with greyish, greenish, olive, yellowish and brownish shades reported. The cap is paler at the margin and fades with age. The widely spaced [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed and whitish, although may be tinted pale green and bruise pink. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and can be swollen in its midriff, and measures {{convert|4|\u2013|11|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|1|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide. A key distinguishing feature in the western United States is an orange-pink colour at the stipe's base. The [[spore print]] is white, and the oval smooth spores measure 5\u20136 \u00d7 3\u20134&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=\"arora86\"/> The odour is distinctive and has been likened to newly scrubbed floors or soap.<ref name=nilper/>\n\nIts gills may lead it to being confused with ''[[Hygrophorus]]'' species.<ref name=\"arora86\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Tricholoma saponaceum'' is a terrestrial mushroom found in Europe and North America.

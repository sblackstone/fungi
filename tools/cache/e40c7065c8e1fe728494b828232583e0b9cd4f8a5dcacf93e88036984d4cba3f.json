It is a large orange mushroom that is often found in clumps on decaying stumps, buried roots or at the base of hardwood trees in eastern North America.  Nearly all field guides claim its gills often exhibit a weak green bioluminescence when fresh; however, some dispute this entirely as a myth.<ref name=mushexp>{{cite web |last1=Kuo |first1=Michael |title=\"Omphalotus illudens\" |url=https://www.mushroomexpert.com/omphalotus_illudens.html |website=mushroomexpert.com |date=May 2015| accessdate=2018-09-01}}</ref> \n\n''Omphalotus illudens'' is sometimes confused with edible [[chanterelle]]s, but is poisonous to humans when eaten, whether raw or cooked, and typically causes vomiting, cramps, and diarrhea. Although some older literature claims the name is [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''[[Omphalotus olearius]]'', [[phylogenetic]] analysis confirms they are distinct species.<ref name=Kirchmair2004/>\n\n==Toxicity==\nThe poisonous chemical compounds [[illudin]] S and [[illudin]] M were isolated from ''Omphalotus illudens''.<ref name=\"Anchel 1950\">{{cite journal|author=Anchel, M.|author2=Herbey, A.|author3=Robbins, W.J. |title=Antibiotic Substances from Basidiomycetes: VII.

[[Muscarine]] has also been indirectly implicated in toxicity,<ref name=Clark1913/> but modern studies to demonstrate its presence in ''O. illudens'' are needed.\n \nThe [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] effect of [[illudin]] is of interest for treating some cancers, but illudin itself is too poisonous to use directly so it must first be chemically modified. Inside human cells, illudin S reacts with DNA and creates a type of DNA damage that blocks [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. This block can only be relieved by a repair system called [[nucleotide excision repair]]. Damage in non-transcribed DNA areas is left unrepaired by the cell. This property was exploited by the company [[MGI Pharma]] to develop an illudin-derivative called [[Irofulven]] for use as a cancer treatment. Its application is still in the experimental phase.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:2007-08-05 Omphalotus illudens (Schwein.)

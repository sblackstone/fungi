A widely distributed species, it grows naturally in eastern North America, East Asia, and Central America; it has also been reported in southern France. ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' grows on the ground in both [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests, where it forms [[mycorrhiza]]l associations with a broad range of trees. The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] color ranges from dark blue in fresh specimens to pale blue-gray in older ones. The milk, or [[latex]], that oozes when the mushroom tissue is cut or broken \u2014 a feature common to all members of the genus ''[[Lactarius]]'' \u2014 is also [[indigo]] blue, but slowly turns green upon exposure to air. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] has a diameter of {{convert|5|to|15|cm|0|abbr=on}}, and the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|2|to|8|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|1|to|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. It is an [[edible mushroom]], and is sold in rural markets in China, Guatemala, and Mexico.\n\n==Taxonomy and nomenclature==\nOriginally described in 1822 as ''Agaricus indigo'' by American mycologist [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]],<ref name=Schweinitz1822/> the species was later transferred to the genus ''Lactarius'' in 1838 by the Swede [[Elias Magnus Fries]].<ref name=Fries1836/> German botanist [[Otto Kuntze]] called it ''Lactifluus indigo'' in his 1891 treatise ''[[Revisio Generum Plantarum]]'',<ref name=Kuntze1891/> but the suggested name change was not adopted by others. [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler|Hesler]] and [[Alexander Hanchett Smith|Smith]] in their 1960 study of North American species of ''Lactarius'' defined ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' as the [[type species]] of subsection ''Caerulei'', a group characterized by blue latex and a sticky, blue cap.<ref name=Hesler1960/> In 1979, they revised their opinions on the organization of subdivisions in the genus ''Lactarius'', and instead placed ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' in [[subgenus]] ''Lactarius'' based on the color of latex, and the subsequent color changes observed after exposure to air.<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], p. 66.</ref> As they explained:<blockquote>The gradual development of blue to violet pigmentation as one progresses from species to species is an interesting phenomenon deserving further study. The climax is reached in ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' which is blue throughout. ''L.&nbsp;chelidonium'' and its variety ''chelidonioides'', ''L.&nbsp;paradoxus'', and ''L. hemicyaneus'' may be considered as mileposts along the road to ''L.&nbsp;indigo''.<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], p. 7.</ref></blockquote>\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''indigo'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word meaning \"indigo blue\".<ref name=Roody2003/> Its names in the English [[common name|vernacular]] include the \"indigo milk cap\",<ref name=Arora69/> the \"indigo Lactarius\",<ref name=Roody2003/> the \"blue milk mushroom\",<ref name=Russell2006/> and the \"blue Lactarius\".<ref name=Fergus2003/> In central Mexico, it is known as ''a\u00f1il'', ''azul'', ''hongo azul'', ''zuin'', and ''zuine''; it is also called ''quexque'' (meaning \"blue\") in [[Veracruz]] and [[Puebla]].<ref name=Montoya1996/>\n\n==Description==\nLike many other mushrooms, ''L. indigo'' develops from a nodule, that forms within the underground [[mycelium]], a mass of threadlike fungal cells called [[hypha]]e that make up the bulk of the organism. Under appropriate environmental conditions of temperature, humidity, and nutrient availability, the visible reproductive structures ([[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]]) are formed. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the fruit body, measuring between {{convert|5|and|15|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, is initially convex and later develops a central depression; in age it becomes even more deeply depressed, becoming somewhat funnel-shaped as the edge of the cap lifts upward.<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], p. 27.</ref> The margin of the cap is rolled inwards when young, but unrolls and elevates as it matures. The cap surface is indigo blue when fresh, but fades to a paler grayish- or silvery-blue, sometimes with greenish splotches. It is often [[wikt:zonate|zonate]]: marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones, and the cap may have dark blue spots, especially towards the edge. Young caps are sticky to the touch.<ref name=Bessette1992/>{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Lactarius indigo 54015.jpg|image2=Lactarius indigo 48609.jpg|width=160|caption1=Overhead view of caps found in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico|caption2=The cap margin is rolled inwards in young specimens.|alt1=Four light-blue colored mushroom caps growing in the ground, surrounded by dead leaves and twigs.|alt2=The underside of a circular, blue mushroom cap lying in the dirt. The edges of the cap are a much lighter blue than the gills that radiate out from the central stem, and are rolled inward, partially covering the gills.}}The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is pallid to bluish in color, slowly turning greenish after being exposed to air; its taste is mild to slightly acrid. The flesh of the entire mushroom is brittle, and the stem, if bent sufficiently, will snap open cleanly.<ref name=Arora1991/> The latex exuded from injured tissue is [[indigo]] blue, and stains the wounded tissue greenish; like the flesh, the latex has a mild taste.<ref name=Roody2003/> ''Lactarius indigo'' is noted for not producing as much latex as other ''Lactarius'' species,<ref name=\"urlFoTM\"/> and older specimens in particular may be too dried out to produce any latex.<ref name=Metzler1992/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] of the mushroom range from [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] (squarely attached to the stem) to slightly [[wikt:decurrent|decurrent]] (running down the length of the stem), and crowded close together. Their color is an indigo blue, becoming paler with age or staining green with damage. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|2|\u2013|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|1|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and the same diameter throughout or sometimes narrowed at base. Its color is indigo blue to silvery- or grayish blue. The interior of the stem is solid and firm initially, but develops a hollow with age.<ref name=Arora69/> Like the cap, it is initially sticky or slimy to the touch when young, but soon dries out.<ref name=MushroomExpert/> Its attachment to the cap is usually in a central position, although it may also be off-center.<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], pp. 68\u20139.</ref> Fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' have no distinguishable odor.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n''L. indigo'' var. ''diminutivus'' (the \"smaller indigo milk cap\") is a smaller variant of the mushroom, with a cap diameter between {{convert|3|and|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and a stem {{convert|1.5|\u2013|4.0|cm|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.3|\u2013|1.0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Bessette2007/> It is often seen in [[Virginia]].<ref name=Miller2006/> Hesler and Smith, who first described the variant based on specimens found in [[Brazoria County, Texas]], described its typical habitat as \"along [the] sides of a muddy ditch under grasses and weeds, [with] [[loblolly pine]] nearby\".<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], p. 70.</ref>\n\n===Microscopic features===\nWhen viewed in mass, as in a [[spore print]], the [[basidiospore|spores]] appear cream to yellow colored.<ref name=Roody2003/><ref name=Arora69>[[#Arora|Arora (1986)]], p. 69.</ref> Viewed with a [[light microscope]], the spores are translucent ([[hyaline]]), elliptical to nearly spherical in shape, with [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] warts, and have dimensions of 7\u20139 by 5.5\u20137.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=Roody2003/> [[Scanning electron microscopy]] reveals [[wikt:reticulation|reticulations]] on the spore surface.<ref name=Montoya1996/> The [[hymenium]] is the spore-producing tissue layer of the fruit body, and consists of [[hypha]]e that extend into the gills and terminate as end cells. Various cell types can be observed in the hymenium, and the cells have microscopic characteristics that may be used to help identify or distinguish species in cases where the macroscopic characters may be ambiguous. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are four-spored and measure 37\u201345&nbsp;\u03bcm long by 8\u201310&nbsp;\u03bcm wide at the thickest point.<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], p. 68.</ref> [[Cystidia]] are terminal cells of hyphae in the hymenium which do not produce spores, and function in aiding spore dispersal, and maintaining favorable humidity around developing spores.<ref name=Watling1977/> The [[wikt:pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] are cystidia that are found on the face of a gill; they are 40\u201356 by 6.4\u20138&nbsp;\u03bcm, roughly spindle-shaped, and have a constricted apex. The [[wikt:cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]]\u2014located on the edge of a gill\u2014are abundant, and are 40.0\u201345.6 by 5.6\u20137.2&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Montoya1996/>\n[[File:Lactarius indigo 7283.jpg|thumb|right|The \"milk\", or latex, is indigo blue.|alt=The finger of a hand are holding a light blue mushroom.

Other ''Lactarius'' species with some blue color include the \"silver-blue milky\" (''[[Lactarius paradoxus|L.&nbsp;paradoxus]]''), found in eastern North America,<ref name=Miller2006/> which has a grayish-blue cap when young, but it has reddish-brown to purple-brown latex and gills. ''[[Lactarius chelidonium|L.&nbsp;chelidonium]]'' has a yellowish to dingy yellow-brown to bluish-gray cap and yellowish to brown latex. ''[[Lactarius quieticolor|L.&nbsp;quieticolor]]'' has blue-colored flesh in the cap and orange to red-orange flesh in the base of the stem.<ref name=Arora69/> Although the blue discoloration of ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' is thought to be rare in the genus ''Lactarius'', in 2007 five new species were reported from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] with bluing latex or flesh, including ''[[Lactarius cyanescens|L.&nbsp;cyanescens]]'', ''[[Lactarius lazulinus|L.&nbsp;lazulinus]]'', ''[[Lactarius mirabilis|L.&nbsp;mirabilis]]'', and two species still unnamed.<ref name=Stubbe2007/>\n\n==Edibility==\nAlthough ''L. indigo'' is a well-known edible species, opinions vary on its desirability. For example, American mycologist [[David Arora]] considers it a \"superior edible\",<ref name=Arora69/> while a [[field guide]] on [[Kansas]] fungi rates it as \"mediocre in quality\".<ref name=Abel1993/> It may have a slightly bitter,<ref name=Hall2003/> or peppery taste,<ref name=McKnight1987/> and has a coarse, grainy texture.<ref name=Roody2003/><ref name=Abel1993/> The firm flesh is best prepared by cutting the mushroom in thin slices. The blue color disappears with cooking, and the mushroom becomes grayish. Because of the granular texture of the flesh, it does not lend itself well to drying. Specimens producing copious quantities of milk may be used to add color to [[marinade]]s.<ref name=Sicard2005/>\n\nIn Mexico, individuals harvest the wild mushrooms for sale at farmers' markets, typically from June to November;<ref name=Montoya1996/> they are considered a \"second class\" species for consumption.<ref name=Bandala1997/> ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' is also sold in Guatemalan markets from May to October.<ref name=Flores2005/> It is one of 13 ''Lactarius'' species sold at rural markets in [[Yunnan]] in southwestern China.<ref name=Wang2000/>\n\n===Chemical composition===\n[[File:Lactarius azulene.png|thumb|right|(7-Isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate, the blue lipophilic [[azulene]] pigment from ''L. indigo''.

Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also tested in the study (''[[Amanita rubescens]]'', ''[[Boletus frostii]]'', and ''[[Ramaria flava]]''), ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' contained the highest [[saturated fatty acid]]s content, including [[stearic acid]] with 32.1&nbsp;mg/g\u2014slightly over half of the total [[free fatty acid]] content.<ref name=LeonGuzman1997/>\n\nThe blue color of ''L. indigo'' is due to (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate, an [[organic compound|organic]] [[Structural analog|analogous]] to [[azulene]], which is biosynthesised from a [[sesquiterpene]] very similar to [[matricin]], the precursor for [[chamazulene]]. It is unique to this species, but similar to a compound found in ''[[Lactarius deliciosus|L.&nbsp;deliciosus]]''.<ref name=Harmon1979/>\n\n==Distribution, habitat, and ecology==\n''L. indigo'' is [[range (biology)|distributed]] throughout southern and eastern North America but is most common along the [[Gulf Coast]], Mexico, and [[Macrofungi of Guatemala|Guatemala]]. Its frequency of appearance in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the United States has been described as \"occasional to locally common\".<ref name=Roody2003/> Mycologist [[David Arora]] notes that in the United States, the species is found with [[ponderosa pine]] in [[Arizona]], but is absent in [[California]]'s ponderosa pine forests.<ref>[[#Arora|Arora (1986)]], p. 35.</ref> It has also been collected from China,<ref name=Wang2000/> India,<ref name=Sharma2002/><ref name=Upadhyay2004/> Guatemala,<ref name=Morales2002/> Costa Rica (in forests dominated by oak),<ref name=Mueller2006/> and as its southernmost distribution in the [[Quercus humboldtii|Humboldt oak]] cloud forests of Colombia.<ref name=Winkler2013/> In Europe, it has so far only been found in southern France.<ref name=Marcel1988/> A study on the seasonal appearance of fruiting bodies in the [[subtropical]] forests of [[Xalapa]], Mexico, confirmed that maximal production coincided with the [[Wet season|rainy season]] between June and September.<ref name=Chacon1995/>\n[[File:Lactarius indigo 19700.jpg|thumb|left|A collection of ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' found in [[Jalisco]], Mexico|alt=About two dozen blue mushroom of varying sizes on a plate.]]\n''L. indigo'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, and as such, establishes a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the roots of certain trees (\"hosts\"), in which the fungi exchange [[mineral]]s and [[amino acids]] extracted from the soil for [[Carbon fixation|fixed carbon]] from the host.

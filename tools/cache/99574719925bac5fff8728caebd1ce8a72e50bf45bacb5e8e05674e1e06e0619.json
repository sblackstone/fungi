The margin (cap edge) is irregular, often wavy, and lobed or ribbed. The cap surface is dry, unpolished, azonate, usually becoming somewhat wrinkled with age, pale dingy yellow-brown to whitish overall, with a smoky tinge, sometimes with tawny olive, pinkish buff, or dull brown areas. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are attached to subdecurrent (running slightly down the length of the stem), narrow, crowded together, whitish, becoming dingy yellow-[[buff (color)|buff]], staining reddish when bruised. The stem is {{convert|4|\u2013|11|cm|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|6|\u2013|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, nearly equal, dry, dull, stuffed, colored like the cap, whitish towards the base, staining reddish, but more slowly than the gills. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is pale white, staining reddish-salmon when cut. Its odor is not distinctive, but the taste is variable: quickly acrid then mild then slowly staining acrid, or very slowly faintly acrid. The [[latex]] is white on exposure, unchanging, staining tissues reddish. The [[spore print]] is pinkish-buff. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] is unknown.<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\n===Microscopic characters===\nThe spores are 6\u20138 by 6\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]], spherical or nearly so, ornamented with ridges that form a partial reticulum, prominences up to 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m high, [[hyaline]] (translucent), [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a palisade of cylindrical to club-shaped cells.<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Lactarius musciola]]'' has darker colors, and its gills do not stain reddish where bruised.<ref name=Bessette2009/> ''[[Lactarius fuliginosus]]'' differs in having broad subdistant gills.<ref name=Guevara1987/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nThe fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;fumosus'' grow solitary, scattered, or in groups on the ground in woods from July\u2013October. The fungus is widely distributed in eastern North America, and has also been reported from western Canada. Its frequency of occurrence is described as occasional.<ref name=Bessette2009/> Its range extends south to northwestern Mexico, where it is found associated with ''[[Liquidambar]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', and ''[[Quercus]]'' species.<ref name=Guevara1987/>\n\n==Bioactive compounds==\nExtracts of the fruit bodies are toxic to the corn earworm, ''[[Heliothis zea]]'' and the large milkweed bug, ''[[Oncopeltus fasciatus]]''. The [[insecticide|insecticidal]] activity is thought to be caused by compounds called [[chromene]]s.<ref name=Dowd1990/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Bessette2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette AR, Bessette A, Harris DM |title=Milk Mushrooms of North America: A Field Guide to the Genus ''Lactarius'' |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse |year=2009 |pages=177\u201378 |isbn=0-8156-3229-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Dowd1990>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dowd PF, Miller OK |year=1990 |title=Insecticidal properties of ''Lactarius fuliginosus'' and ''Lactarius fumosus'' |journal=Entomologia experimentalis et applicata |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=23\u201328 |doi=10.1007/BF00349592}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Guevara1987>{{cite journal |vauthors=Guevara G, Garcia J, Castillo J, Miller OK |year=1987 |title=New records of ''Lactarius'' in Mexico |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=30 |pages=157\u201376 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0030/0157.htm |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Peck1872>{{cite journal |author=Peck CH. |year=1872 |title=Report of the Botanist (1870) |journal=Annual Report on the New York State Museum of Natural History |volume=24 |issue= |page=74 |url= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Lactarius fumosus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=355687 |title=''Lactarius fumosus'' Peck 1872 |publisher=International Mycological Association |work=MycoBank |accessdate=2010-07-10}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n===Cited text===\n*{{cite book |title=North American Species of ''Lactarius'' |vauthors=Hesler LR, Smith AH |year=1979 |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Michigan |isbn=0-472-08440-2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IndexFungorum|355687}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q6468937}}\n\n[[Category:Lactarius|fumosus]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1872]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Charles Horton Peck]]"}]}}}}

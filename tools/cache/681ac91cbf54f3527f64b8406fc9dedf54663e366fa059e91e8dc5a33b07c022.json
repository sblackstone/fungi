It is found throughout eastern North America on the ground in [[coniferous forest]]s near [[Conium|hemlock]] or [[deciduous forest]]s near [[oak]], and in oak-dominated forests of [[Costa Rica]]. It produces large [[mushroom]]s with funnel-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] reaching up to {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, on top of hard white [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] that may reach {{convert|4|\u2013|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are closely spaced together and yellowish-cream in color. When young, the cap is white in all parts, but the depressed center becomes dull brownish in age and breaks up into scales. The edge of the cap has a roll of cottony tissue that collapses as the cap expands. The surface of the stem\u2014especially near the base\u2014has a velvety texture. The mushroom \"bleeds\" a milky white acrid [[latex]] when it is cut or injured. The fruit bodies are [[edible mushroom|edible]], but have a bitter taste that can be removed with cooking. Similar milk-cap species with which ''L.&nbsp;deceptivus'' might be confused include ''[[Lactifluus piperatus]]'', ''[[Lactifluus pseudodeceptivus|L. pseudodeceptivus]]'', ''[[Lactifluus caeruleitinctus|L.&nbsp;caeruleitinctus]]'', ''[[Lactifluus subvellereus|L.&nbsp;subvellereus]]'', ''[[Lactarius&nbsp;arcuatus]]'' and ''[[Lactarius parvulus]]''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first described in the scientific literature by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1885.<ref name=Peck1884/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''deceptivus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word for \"deceptive\".<ref name=Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991/> The name may allude to the contrasting appearance of young and old fruit bodies.<ref name=Roody2003/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"deceptive lactarius\", the \"deceiving lactarius\",<ref name=Roody2003/> or the \"deceptive milkcap\". In the state of [[Puebla]], Mexico, it is known as ''oreja de chivo'', or \"kid ear\".<ref name=Montoya1996/>\n\nFollowing the split-off of the [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] distinct genus ''Lactifluus'' from the other milk-caps in the genus ''[[Lactarius]]'',<ref name=\"Buyck2008\"/><ref name=\"verbeken2013\"/> the correct combination for the species is the one made by [[Otto Kuntze]] in 1891,<ref name=\"urlRussulales News / Lactarius deceptivus\"/> ''Lactifluus deceptivus''. Within the genus ''Lactifluus'', ''L.&nbsp;deceptivus'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[subgenus]] ''Lactifluus'', [[section (biology)|section]] ''Albati''. Characteristics of species in this section include a white or whitish immature cap that may later turn yellow-brown to cinnamon-color; white to cream-colored latex that typically has an [[wikt:acrid|acrid]] taste; a velvet-textured stem due to a cuticle made of long narrow, thick-walled hairs. Other species in this section include ''[[Lactifluus vellereus|L.&nbsp;vellereus]]'' (the [[type species]]), ''[[Lactifluus subvellereus|L.&nbsp;subvellereus]]'', and ''[[Lactifluus caeruleitinctus|L.&nbsp;caeruleitinctus]]''.<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1979, p. 191.</ref>\n\nBased on a [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] study published in 2005, ''Lactarius tomentosomarginatus'' is considered [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''Lactifluus&nbsp;deceptivus''.<ref name=Montoya2005/> ''L.&nbsp;tomentosomarginatus'', described by Hesler and Smith in their 1979 monograph of North American milk-caps, was considered by them to be a \"satellite species\", differing from ''L.&nbsp;deceptivus'' on the basis of smaller [[spore]]s, smaller ornamentations on the surface of the spores, crowded and forked narrow gills, and differences in the micro-structure of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]].<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1979, pp. 195\u201397.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lactarius deceptivus 50256.jpg|thumb|left|The closely spaced gills are whitish before turning [[tan (color)|tan]] in age.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|7.5|-|25.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, initially convex, but becomes funnel-shaped in age. The margin (cap edge) is rolled inwards and cottony when young, concealing the immature [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. The cap surface is dry, smooth and whitish when young, often with yellowish or brownish stains, but becomes coarsely scaly and darkens to dull brownish-ochre with age. The gills have an adnate to decurrent attachment to the stem, close to subdistant, white at first then cream to pale ochre. They are {{convert|5|\u2013|65|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|\u2013|7|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4|\u2013|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, nearly equal in width throughout or tapered downward. It is dry, scurfy to nearly smooth and white, staining brown with age.<ref name=\"Bessette 2009 p.167\">Bessette ''et al''., 2009, p. 167.</ref> It is initially stuffed (as if filled with cotton), but later becomes hollow. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick and white, and between {{convert|3|and|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. The latex produced by the mushroom is white, and does not change color upon exposure to air, although it stains the mushroom flesh a yellowish-brown color.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>\n\nThe odor of the flesh and latex may range from indistinct to pungent or turnip-like in age; the taste is strongly acrid\u2014so much that it may have an anesthetizing effect in the throat.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> In his original description of the species, Peck reported \"An experiment of its edible qualities was made without any evil consequences.\"<ref name=Peck1884/> Thorough cooking removes the bitter taste,<ref name=\"Bessette 2009 p.167\"/> but the mushroom is not highly regarded as an edible,<ref name=Roody2003/> and as Hesler and Smith have noted \"... but even with this compensating feature some of our acquaintances have found it rather undesirable (and indigestible).\"<ref name=\"H&S pp. 194-95\">Hesler and Smith, 1979, pp. 193\u201395.</ref> The mushroom is sold at traditional markets in Puebla, Mexico.<ref name=Montoya1996/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore print]], freshly made, is white to whitish; after drying out the spores in mass are pale yellowish. The [[spore]]s are broadly ellipsoid, [[hyaline]] (translucent) and measure 9\u201313 by 7\u20139&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. An [[wikt:apiculus|apiculus]] is prominent. The spores are ornamented with warts and spines that do not form a reticulum (a system of raised, net-like ridges) on the surface. The prominences are up to 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m high, and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning they absorb [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, and measure 46\u201358 by 7\u20139&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[wikt:pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] ([[cystidium|cystidia]] found on the face of a gill) are very abundant, roughly club-shaped to [[ventricose]](swollen in the middle), with apices often tapering; their dimensions are 48\u201396 x 6\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[wikt:cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] (cystidia on the edge of the gills) are 40\u201358 x 5\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m, and more or less similar in appearance to the pleurocystidia.<ref name=\"H&S pp. 194-95\"/>  The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of a layer of somewhat uplifted hyphae. The stem cuticle is a layer of bent-over hyphae bearing thick-walled, filamentous caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem), and it lacks a gelatinous layer.<ref name=\"Bessette 2009 p.167\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nThe fungus ''[[Lactifluus pseudodeceptivus]]'' is very similar to ''L.&nbsp;deceptivus'' in its external appearance, but it has spore ornamentation that forms a reticulum, and its stem is an [[wikt:ixocutis|ixocutis]] (a gelatinous layer of hyphae lying parallel to the surface). ''[[Lactifluus caeruleitinctus|L.&nbsp;caeruleitinctus]]'' is also similar in appearance, but it has a milky-white stem with blue tints that develops more intense blue coloration after handling, and it lacks a cottony, inrolled margin. Other lookalike species include ''[[Lactarius arcuatus]]'', which has a much smaller cap and smaller spores,<ref>Bessette ''et al''., 2009, p. 148.</ref> and ''[[Lactarius parvulus|Lactarius&nbsp;parvulus]]'', which has a small, [[wikt:zonate|zonate]] cap.<ref>Bessette ''et al''., 2009, p. 217.</ref> ''[[Russula brevipes]]'' and ''[[Russula angustispora|R.&nbsp;angustispora]]'' are also somewhat similar in appearance, but they do not produce latex when cut or injured. ''Lactifluus subvellereus'' var. ''subdistans'' has more widely spaced gills, and an even cap margin. ''[[Lactifluus piperatus]]'' has densely crowded gills, a firm rather than soft and cottony cap margin, and exceedingly acrid latex.<ref name=Roody2003/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[File:Lactarius deceptivus 56432.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Caps of older specimens break up into yellowish brown scales from the center outward.]]\nLike all milk-caps (''Lactarius'' and ''Lactifluus''), ''L.&nbsp;deceptivus'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l, meaning the fungus forms a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] association with certain trees and shrubs. The subterranean [[mycelium]] of the fungus forms an intimate association with tree roots, enveloping them in a sheath of tissue that allows both organisms to exchange nutrients they would otherwise be unable to obtain. The fruit bodies of the fungus grow solitarily, scattered, or in groups on the ground in [[coniferous forest|conifer]] or [[hardwood forest]]s, often under [[oak]] (''Quercus'') or [[Tsuga|hemlock]] (''Tsuga''). [[Alexander H. Smith|Smith]] has noted a preference for bogs and the edges of woodland pools in hardwood forests, and in oak stands that have an [[understory]] of blueberry bushes (''[[Vaccinium]]'' species).<ref name=Smith1980/> It is widely distributed in eastern North America, and has also been reported from southern<ref name=Ammirati1985/> and western Canada.<ref name=Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991/> It is a fairly common species, and fruits from June to October.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> The mushroom has also been reported from Mexico (in Puebla and in [[Veracruz]]) from oak and pine forests, at altitudes slightly over {{convert|2000|m|mi|sp=us}},<ref name=Montoya1990/> and from [[Costa Rica]], where it is abundant in oak forests.<ref name=\"urlLactarius deceptivus\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactifluus species|List of ''Lactifluus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Buyck2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Buyck B, Hofstetter V, Eberhardt U, Verbeken A, Kauff F |year=2008|title=Walking the thin line between ''Russula'' and ''Lactarius'': the dilemma of ''Russula'' subsect.

[[Common name|Commonly]] known as the '''decorated pholiota''', it is distinguished by its [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] which is covered with pointed brown, curved scales on the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and by its white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. Found in the eastern United States, France, and Pakistan, it is [[saprobic]], growing on the decaying wood of [[hardwood]] trees. ''L.&nbsp;decorosa'' was first described by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] as ''Agaricus decorosus'' in 1873, and the species has been transferred to several [[genera]] in its history, including ''[[Tricholoma]]'', ''[[Tricholomopsis]]'', ''[[Armillaria]]'', and ''[[Floccularia]]''. Three American mycologists considered the species unique enough to warrant its own genus, and transferred it into the new genus ''[[Leucopholiota]]'' in a 1996 publication. Lookalike species with similar colors and scaly fruit bodies include ''[[Pholiota squarrosoides]]'', ''[[Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus]]'', and ''[[Leucopholiota lignicola]]''. ''L.&nbsp;decorosa'' is considered an [[edible mushroom]].\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n\nThe species now known as ''Leucopholiota decorosa'' was [[species description|first described]] by [[Charles Horton Peck|Charles Peck]] in 1873, based on a specimen he found in [[New York State]]; he placed it in ''[[Tricholoma]]'', then considered a [[subgenus]] of ''[[Agaricus]]''.<ref name=Peck1873/> In 1947, [[Alexander Hanchett Smith|Alexander Smith]] and Walters transferred the species into the genus ''[[Armillaria]]'', based on its apparent close relationship to ''[[Armillaria luteovirens]]''; the presence of [[clamp connection]]s in the [[hypha]]e, the [[amyloid]] spores, and the structure of the [[partial veil|veil]] and its remnants.<ref name=Smith1947/> The genus ''Armillaria'', as it was understood at the time, would later be referred to as a \"taxonomic refugium for about 270 white-spored species with attached gills and an annulus.\"<ref name=urlTVFotM/> Smith later transferred the species to the genus ''[[Tricholomopsis]]'';<ref name=Smith1960/> however, he neglected the amyloid spores, the recurved scales of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]], and the lack of cells known as pleurocystidia, features which should have ruled out a taxonomic transfer into the genus.<ref name=Miller1996/> In 1987, the species was transferred yet again, this time to the genus ''[[Floccularia]]''.<ref name=Bon1987/>\n\nThe appearance of a specimen at a 1994 [[Mushroom hunting|mushroom foray]] in [[North Carolina]] resulted in a collaboration between mycologists Tom Volk, [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.]] and Alan Bessette, who renamed the species ''Leucopholiota decorosa'' in a 1996 ''[[Mycologia]]'' publication.<ref name=urlTVFotM/> ''[[Leucopholiota]]'' was originally  a [[subgenus]] of ''Armillaria'', but the authors raised it to generic level to accommodate ''L.&nbsp;decorosa'', which would become the [[type species]].<ref name=Miller1996/> In 2008, [[Henning Knudsen]] considered ''L.&nbsp;decorosa'' to be the same species as what was then known as ''Amylolepiota lignicola'', and considered the two names to be [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]].<ref name=Knudsen2008/> However, Finnish mycologist [[Harri Harmaja]] rejected this interpretation. Originally, Harmaja believed ''Lepiota lignicola'' sufficiently distinct from other similar taxa to deserve its own genus ''Amylolepiota'', which he described in a 2002 publication.<ref name=Harmaja2002/> He changed his mind in 2010, writing \"the differences between the type species of both genera are small and are thus best considered as differences at the species level\"; with this he transferred the taxon to ''Leucopholiota'', and it is now known as ''[[Leucopholiota lignicola]]'', the second species in genus ''[[Leucopholiota]]''.<ref name=Harmaja2010/>\n\nThe genus name ''Leucopholiota'' means \"white Pholiota\" (from \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, ''leuk\u00f3s''), referring to the gills and the spores; it was proposed in 1980 by [[Henri Romagnesi]] who originally described it as a [[subgenus]] of ''Armillaria''.<ref name=Romagnesi1980/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''decorosa'', though intended for \"elegant\" or \"handsome\", actually means \"decent\", \"respectable\", \"modest\", or \"decorous\". ''L.&nbsp;decorosa'' is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"decorated Pholiota\".<ref name=Roody2003/>\n\n==Phylogenetics==\n\n[[Phylogenetic]] analysis based on evidence from [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] and large subunit [[ribosomal RNA]] sequence data have not confirmed that ''Leucopholiota decorosa'' belongs in the [[Tricholomataceae]] family. However, the analysis does show it to be phylogenetically related to ''[[Phaeolepiota aurea]]'', a species of unclear status in the [[Agaricales]], and it confirms that ''L.&nbsp;decorosa'' does not belong in the family [[Agaricaceae]].<ref name=Vellinga2004/> According to the species authors,<ref name=Miller1996/> ''L.&nbsp;decorosa'' would fit best in the ''Biannularieae'' tribe of the Tricholomataceae as described by [[Rolf Singer]] in his comprehensive [[monograph]] on the Agaricales. This tribe also contains the [[genera]] ''[[Catathelasma]]'' and ''[[Armillaria]]''.<ref name=Singer1986/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Leucopholiota decorosa 77989.jpg|left|thumb|The gills of the mushroom are closely spaced and white.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of ''L.&nbsp;decorosa'', initially conic or hemispherical in shape, later expand to become convex or flattened in maturity. The caps are typically between {{convert|2|to|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, with surfaces covered with many small curved brown scales. The edge of the cap is typically curved inwards and may have coarse brown fibers attached.<ref name=Miller1996/> The cap is cinnamon brown, darker in the center.<ref name=Smith1947/> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are spaced together closely; they have a narrow (''adnexed'') attachment to the stem, and their edges are \"finely scalloped\".<ref name=Miller1996/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|2.5|to|7.0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|0.6|to|1.2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and like the cap, is covered with scales from the bottom to the level of the annular zone; above this point the stipe is smooth. The [[partial veil]] is made up of brown fibers \"that flare upward as an annulus.\"<ref name=Miller2006/> It is roughly the same thickness throughout the length of the stem, or may be slightly thinner near the top. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white and thick, and has a firm texture; its odor is indistinct, and the taste either mild or bitter. The [[spore print|spore deposit]] is white.<ref name=Miller1996/>\n\nThe [[basidiospore|spores]] are [[hyaline]] (translucent), roughly elliptical in shape, have thin walls, and are amyloid, meaning they absorb iodine stain in [[Melzer's reagent]].<ref name=Miller1996/> Additionally, in acetocarmine stain, they appear [[wikt:binucleate|binucleate]] (having two nuclei).<ref name=Harmaja2010/> They have dimensions of 5.5\u20136 (more rarely 7) by 3.5\u20134.0&nbsp;\u00b5m. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are club-shaped, translucent, and four-spored. The cheilocystida ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are club-shaped and 19-24 by 3\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a trichodermium\u2014a type of tissue composed of erect, long, threadlike [[hypha]]e of same or different lengths, and originating from an interwoven layer of hyphae that ascends gradually until terminal cells are somewhat parallel to each other. The trichodermal hyphae are thin-walled, measuring 7.6\u201322.0&nbsp;\u00b5m, and stain yellowish in Melzer's reagent. The hyphae comprising the cap tissue are thin-walled and 5\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, while those of the gill tissue are also thin-walled, and 3.5\u20137.0&nbsp;\u00b5m, and interspersed with oleiferous cells (characterized by strongly [[refraction|refractive]], homogeneous contents). [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of all tissues.<ref name=Miller1996/>\n\n===Edibility===\nAccording to one field guide published in 2006, ''Leucopholiota decorosa'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]], based on the following comment by McIlvaine and MacAdam, written in 1900: \"it is of good consistency and flavor, having a decided mushroom taste.\"<ref name=Miller2006/> Other older sources report the edibility as unknown.<ref name=Roody2003/><ref name=Bessette1995/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Lookalikes ''Phaeomarasmius erinaceus'' (left) and ''Pholiota squarrosoides'' (right)\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Phaeomarasmius erinaceus 50789.jpg\n| image2 = Pholiota squarrosoides 56037.jpg\n}}\nThe species ''[[Pholiota squarrosoides]]'' has a similar outward appearance, but it may be distinguished by its brown spores and sticky cap surface underneath the scales.<ref name=Roody2003/> In the hedgehog pholiota (''[[Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus]]''), the overall size is smaller\u2014cap diameter {{convert|1|to|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}\u2014and the spores are cinnamon-brown.<ref name=urlEmberger/> Some species in the genus ''[[Cystoderma]]'' also appear similar, but can be distinguished by microscopic features, like the presence of spherical (rather than club-shaped) cells in the cuticle of the cap, and also their habitat\u2014''Cystoderma'' usually grows on soil, rather than wood.<ref name=Bessette1995/>\n\nThe only other species of ''Leucopholiota'', ''[[Leucopholiota lignicola|L.&nbsp;lignicola]]'', may be distinguished from ''L.&nbsp;decorosa'' by the following characteristics: free gills in ''L.&nbsp;lignicola'' compared with adnexed gills in ''L.&nbsp;decorosa''; ''L.&nbsp;lignicola'' tends to grow on the wood of [[Birch]], and preferably in [[old-growth forest]]s; ''L.&nbsp;lignicola'' is restricted to [[boreal forest]], compared to ''L.&nbsp;decorosa'' that grows in [[temperate]] regions; ''L.&nbsp;lignicola'' has a wide distribution throughout northern [[coniferous forest]]s in [[Eurasia]].<ref name=Harmaja2002/><ref name=Harmaja2010/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\n''Leucopholiota decorosa'' is a [[saprobic]] species, deriving nutrients from decaying [[organic matter]], particularly the rotting branches and stumps of [[deciduous]] trees. One [[field guide]] notes a preference for [[sugar maple]].<ref name=Roody2003/> It grows singly or in bunches, clustered together at the base of the stem. In Ohio, it typically fruits from late September to mid November.<ref name=Smith1947/>\n\nIn addition to its known distribution in mostly eastern North America,<ref name=Miller1996/> ''Leucopholiota decorosa'' has also been collected from France.<ref name=Romagnesi1980/> In 2007, it was reported from the [[Astore District]] of [[Pakistan]], at an altitude of about {{convert|3600|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Razaq2007/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Tricholomataceae genera]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Bessette1995>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette A, ((Miller OK Jr)), Bessette AR, Miller HR |title=Mushrooms of North America in Color: a Field Guide Companion to Seldom-Illustrated Fungi |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |year=1995 |pages=82\u201383 |isbn=0-8156-2666-5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bon1987>{{cite journal |title=Cl\u00e9 monographique des russules d'Europe |journal=Documents Mycologiques |year=1987 |author=Bon M. |volume=18 |issue=70\u201371 |page=38 |language=French}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Harmaja2002>{{cite journal |author=Harmaja H. |year=2002 |title=''Amylolepiota'', ''Clavicybe'' and ''Cystodermella'', new genera of the Agaricales |journal=Karstenia |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=39\u201348 |url=http://www.karstenia.fi/42_2_02.php |accessdate=2010-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720185148/http://www.karstenia.fi/42_2_02.php |archivedate=2011-07-20 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Harmaja2010>{{cite journal |author=Harmaja H. |title=A new combination in ''Leucopholiota'' (Agaricales, Fungi) |journal=Phytotaxa |year=2010 |volume=3 |pages=59\u201360 |url=http://www.mapress.com/phytotaxa/content/2010/f/p00003p060f.pdf |format=PDF 1st page preview |issn=1179-3155}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Knudsen2008>{{cite book |title=Funga Nordica |author=Knudsen H, Vesterholt J.

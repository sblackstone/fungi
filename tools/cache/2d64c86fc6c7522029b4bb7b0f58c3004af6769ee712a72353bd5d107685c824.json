Although it has [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]], it is a member of the order [[Boletales]], along with the boletes. The fruiting bodies sprout in pine, fir and spruce woodland in Europe in autumn. Initially, are completely covered with a slimy veil, breaking through to reveal a greyish or brownish-capped mushroom with decurrent greyish gills which sometimes resembles a child's [[top]]. Opinions differ on the suitability of this mushroom for the table, some guides hold it in high regard, while others view it with caution.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Gomphidius glutinosus'' was initially described by [[Germany|German]] mycologist [[Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer]] as ''Agaricus glutinosus'' in 1774, before the father of mycology [[Elias Magnus Fries]] gave it its current genus and binomial name in 1838. The genus name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]  '\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2' ''gomphos'' meaning \"plug\" or \"large wedge-shaped nail\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Liddell HJ, Scott R|year=1980|title=Greek-English Lexicon, Abridged Edition|publisher=Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-910207-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/lexicon00lidd}}</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''glutinosus'' is the [[Latin]] adjective \"sticky\".<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-063005-3|page=112}}</ref>\n\nAlternate common names in Germany are ''Kuhmaul'' \"cow snout\",<ref name=Nilper/> and ''Rotzer''.<ref name=Zeitl76>{{cite book|author=Zeitlmayr L|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms:An Illustrated Handbook|publisher=Garden City Press, Hertfordshire|isbn= 978-0-584-10324-3|pages=93\u201394}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Gomphidius glutinosus 131007a.jpg|thumb|left|200px|young mushroom]]\nSaid to resemble a child's [[top]], the mushroom has a dark brownish or greyish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to 12&nbsp;cm (4.5&nbsp;in) in diameter; it has a central boss and an inrolled margin, and is initially convex and later flattens and may develop blackish markings.<ref name=Nilper/> As with other members of the genus, the whole mushroom is often covered with slimy or sticky veil when young.

The whitish flesh may have a  wine-coloured tinge and has little taste or smell. The widely spaced decurrent gills are waxy in texture, with a hairy surface from the [[cystidia]].<ref name=Zeitl76/> Sometimes branched, they are initially whitish, then grey and later blackening with spores, and the [[spore print]] is brownish-black.

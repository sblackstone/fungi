The small, inconspicuous, dull brown mushroom can be found in groups or clusters on the decaying wood of broad-leaved trees.  Young specimens are easily recognized by the presence of a partial veil, as there are no other agarics that lack a stipe and have a partial veil.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] may be somewhat viscid when wet. Dimensions of the cap are approximately 0.5-2.0&nbsp;cm across.  The fruit body is generally small, brown, and clamshell-shaped. '''''Tectella patellaris''''' lacks a true [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].  The stipitate point of attachment is short (0.1-0.3&nbsp;cm) and manifests as a lateral extension of the pileus.  The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] radiate from this central point of attachment. This mushroom is [[saprobic]] and found on fallen logs of hardwoods in North America and Europe.  The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''patellaris'' means \"dish shaped\". The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"Veiled Panus\".   The snuff brown gills of young specimens are covered with a buff white ephemeral partial veil that may be absent in older specimens.  The spore deposit from '''''Tectella patellaris''''' is white.<ref name=\"Central\">{{cite book | last = C.

Spores are white in mass. Cheilocystidia are present on gill edges.<ref name=\"Central\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''Tectella patellaris'' can be distinguished from other saprophytic, white-spored, pendulous species by the presence of its partial veil and unique lamellar attachment.  ''Panellus stipticus'' is tougher, lacks the partial veil, and is luminescent.  ''[[Crepidotus mollis]]'' and ''[[Crepidotus applanatus]]'' are brown-spored.\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n'' Tectella patellaris'' is widely distributed in North America and Europe and due to its inconspicuous and unassuming presence, may be more common than is reported.<ref name=\"Central\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q7692811}}\n\n[[Category:Mycenaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1838]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Inedible fungi]]"}]}}}}

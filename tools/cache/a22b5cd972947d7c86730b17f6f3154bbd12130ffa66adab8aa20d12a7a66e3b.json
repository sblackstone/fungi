It causes a [[white rot]] in various types of broadleaved trees, particularly [[beech]] (''Fagus''), but also ''[[Abies]]'', ''[[Picea]]'', ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'' and ''[[Ulmus]]'' species. This [[bracket fungi|bracket fungus]], commonly known as the '''giant polypore''' or '''black-staining polypore''', is often found in large clumps at the base of trees, although [[fruiting bodies]] are sometimes found some distance away from the trunk, parasitizing the roots. ''M. giganteus'' has a [[circumboreal]] distribution in the [[northern Hemisphere]], and is widely distributed in Europe. In the field, it is recognizable by the large, multi-capped fruiting body, as well as its pore surface that quickly darkens black when bruised or injured.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[basidiocarp]]s consist of numerous [[Rosette (botany)|rosette]]-like flattened fan-shaped [[Pileus (mycology)|pilei]]; they are typically {{convert|50|\u2013|200|cm|in}} in diameter and {{convert|20|\u2013|80|cm|in}} high. The individual caps, up to {{convert|20|-|80|cm|in}} diameter and {{convert|1|\u2013|4|cm|in}} thick, arise from a common [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/basal basal] stem.[[File:Meripilus giganteus orijaski zbunac.jpg|thumb|left|150px|An older specimen of ''M. giganteus'' with brown, [[zonate]] pilei.]]\n\nThe color of the cap surface is pale tan to dull chestnut brown in young specimens but darkens in age to become concentric zones ([http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/zonate zonate]) of various shades of brown.\n\nThe surface is also finely [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appressed-fibrillose fibrillose] with tiny scales ([http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/squamules squamules]). There are 3 to 6 pores per millimeter on the underside; the pore surface bruises brown and black, helping to distinguish it from the similar species ''[[Grifola frondosa]]''.\n\nInfection of a tree is often through a dead tap root, and decay is largely restricted to roots, and then mainly on the underside. Infected trees often show thinning of the outer crown due to impaired root function. Tree failure is due to brittle fracture of degraded lateral roots.<ref>Fungal Strategies of Wood Decay in Trees - Schartze, Engels and Mattheck (2000)</ref>\n\n;Microscopic features\n[[Spore]]s are roughly spherical to ovoid or ellipsoid in shape, with typical dimensions of 6\u20136.5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5.5\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. Under a microscope, they appear translucent ([[hyaline]]), smooth, and [[nonamyloid]], meaning that they do not absorb stain from [[Melzer's reagent]].<ref name=LarsenLombard1988>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3807709 |jstor=3807709 |title=The Status of Meripilus giganteus (Aphyllophorales, Polyporaceae) in North America |journal=Mycologia |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=612\u201321 |year=1988 |last1=Larsen |first1=Michael J |last2=Lombard |first2=Frances F }}</ref> The [[basidia]]&mdash;the spore-bearing cells&mdash;are club-shaped, 4-spored, and are 22&ndash;40 by 7&ndash;8&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=\"Ryvarden2 1993\">{{cite book |author=Ryvarden L. |title=European Polypores (Part 2)|publisher=Lubrecht & Cramer Ltd. |location=Oslo, Norway |year=1993 |pages=395\u201397|isbn=978-82-90724-12-7}}</ref>\n\nPolypore fungi may be further distinguished by the type of hyphae that makes up their fruiting body.

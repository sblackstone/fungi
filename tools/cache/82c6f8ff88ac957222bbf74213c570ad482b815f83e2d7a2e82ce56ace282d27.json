A group that have become known as '''brittlegills'''. It has been [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''Common Yellow Russula''' for some years, and latterly the '''Ochre Brittlegill'''. It is widespread, and common in mixed woodland.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Russula ochroleuca'' was first noted and named as a species of ''[[Agaricus]]'' by the pioneering South African mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801.\n\n== Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is dull yellow and {{convert|5|\u2013|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, initially convex, later flat, or slightly depressed. The cap margin becomes furrowed when mature, and it is two-thirds peeling. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white to greyish white, and are adnexed.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book| author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref> The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|3|\u2013|7|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, cylindrical, white or later greyish. The taste is mild to moderately hot.\n\nIt could be confused with the similar-looking and much better tasting ''[[Russula claroflava]]''.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n'''''Russula ochroleuca''''' grows in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous forest]], where it (at least in Northwestern Europe) is very common. In the USA it is fairly common under conifers; [[birch]], and [[aspen]] in the Northern States.<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nAlthough considered [[edible mushroom|edible]], it is not known as particularly tasty.

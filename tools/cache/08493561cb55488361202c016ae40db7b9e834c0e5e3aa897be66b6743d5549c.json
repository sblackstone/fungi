It belongs to the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'', a group collectively known as webcaps. It is found growing in conifer plantations, and has recently been given the fanciful common name of '''surprise webcap'''. In the past it has been called the '''red-gilled webcap'''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThis mushroom is placed by some authorities in the genus ''[[Dermocybe]]''. Most mycologists retain ''Dermocybe'' as merely a subgenus of ''Cortinarius''. The group contains almost 30 species. The species name ''semisanguineus'' means 'half blood-red', a reference to the [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] colour, as compared with ''Cortinarius sanguineus'' which is wholly blood-red.<ref name=H&R1992>{{cite book|author=Helmut and Renate Grunert|year=1992|title=Field Guide to MUSHROOMS of Britain and Europe (English Edition)|publisher=The Crowood Press Ltd|isbn=1-85223-592-6}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is campanulate (bell-shaped), and later flattens, but retains a broad umbo (shield-like central boss). It is usually between {{convert|2|\u2013|8|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} across, brownish ochre, or umber and with a darker centre. It is covered in fine fibrils, and is dry. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is usually the same colour as the cap or paler, and is smooth, or finely fibrillose like the cap. It is long, slim, and cylindrical. [[Cortina (mycology)|Cortinal]] remnants often left on the stem in this species can be quite fleeting. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate, markedly sinuate, and fairly crowded. They are initially blood-red, but turn cinnamon-brown on aging, giving a [[spore print]] of the same colour. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is said to smell of radishes,<ref name=H&R1992/> and it is [[ochre]] in the stem, but more olive in the cap.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book|author=Roger Phillips|year=2006|title=Mushrooms|publisher=[[Pan MacMillan]]|isbn=0-330-44237-6|page=205}}</ref>\n\nA similar species, ''Cortinarius phoeniceus''<!-- (Vent.) Maire Bull. Fr. (1911)--> has a redder cap, and more distinct red cortinal remnants around the stem.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book|author=Thomas Laessoe|year=1998|title=Mushrooms (flexi bound)|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|isbn=0-7513-1070-0}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Cortinarius semisanguineus'' appears in [[coniferous forest|conifer]], or [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed conifer]], and birch woods in autumn (fall). It is occasional in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]], [[Scandinavia]], and parts of [[North America]]. It has a [[mycorrhizae|mycorrhizal]] relationship with birch trees (''[[Betula]]''), and other [[coniferous]] softwood trees. It is often abundant under young spruce in plantations on acid soil,<ref name=T.Laessoe/> appearing from August to November.\n\n==Edibility==\n''Cortinarius semisanguineus'' cannot be recommended for the table as it is suspected of being toxic; it may contain similar poisonous compounds to those found in deadly ''Cortinarius'', such as ''[[cortinarius orellanus|C.&nbsp;orellanus]]'' and its close relatives.<ref name=H&R1992/>\n\n==Other uses==\n''Cortinarius semisanguineus'' can be used as a dye for textile yarns.\n\n[[File:Wool_yarn_Cortinarius_semisanguineus.jpg|thumb|Wool yarn dyed with ''Cortinarius semisanguineus'']]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Cortinarius species|List of ''Cortinarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Cortinarius+semisanguineus&oq=Cortinarius+semisanguineus&gs_l=youtube.3...91367.91367.0.92051.1.1.0.0.0.0.137.137.0j1.1.0...0.0...1ac.ZeQV3_xv25s Videos of ''Cortinarius semisanguineus'' on YouTube]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2475465}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cortinarius semisanguineus}}\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Cortinarius|semisanguineus]]"}]}}}}

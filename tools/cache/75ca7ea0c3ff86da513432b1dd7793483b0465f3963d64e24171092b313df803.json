It is a common mushroom in Europe and North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a slimy, dark olive colored conical head. Known as the [[gleba]], this material contains the [[spore]]s, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor\u2014described as resembling [[carrion]]. Despite its foul smell, it is not [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of [[France]] and [[Germany]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nBotanist [[John Gerard]] called it the \"pricke [[mushroom]]\" or \"fungus virilis penis effigie\" in his ''General Historie of Plants'' of 1597, and [[John Parkinson (botanist)|John Parkinson]] referred to it as \"Hollanders workingtoole\" or \"phallus hollandicus\" in his ''Theatrum botanicum'' of 1640.<ref name=Benjamin1995/> [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] described it in his 1753 ''[[Species Plantarum]]'',<ref name=Linnaeus1753/> and it still bears its original binomial name. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]], ''impudicus'', is derived from the [[Latin]] for \"shameless\" or \"immodest\".<ref name=Simpson1979/>\n\n== Description ==\n\nSometimes called the ''witch's egg'',<ref name=Persson1978/> the immature stinkhorn is whitish or pinkish, egg-shaped, and typically {{convert|4|to|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} by {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Ellis1990/>[[File:Hexenei.jpg|thumb|left|An immature fruiting body (\"egg\") in longitudinal section]]On the outside is a thick whitish [[Volva (mycology)|volva]], also known as the [[peridium]], covering the olive-colored gelatinous [[gleba]]. It is the latter that contains the spores and later stinks and attracts the flies; within this layer is a green layer which will become the 'head' of the expanded fruit body; and inside this is a white structure called the receptaculum (the stalk when expanded), that is hard, but has an airy structure like a sponge.<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> The eggs become fully grown stinkhorns very rapidly, over a day or two.<ref name=Persson1978/> The mature stinkhorn is {{convert|10|to|30|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|4|to|5|cm|1|abbr=on}} in diameter,<ref name=Ellis1990/> topped with a conical cap {{convert|2|to|4|cm|1|abbr=on}} high that is covered with the greenish-brown slimy gleba. In older fungi the slime is eventually removed, exposing a bare yellowish pitted and ridged (''reticulate'') surface. This has a passing resemblance to the common morel (''[[Morchella esculenta#Description|Morchella esculenta]]''), for which it is sometimes mistaken.<ref name=Arora1986/> The rate of growth of ''Phallus impudicus'' has been measured at {{convert|10|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} per hour. The growing fruit body is able to exert up to 1.33&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] of [[pressure]] \u2014 a force sufficient to push up through [[asphalt]].<ref name=Niksic2004/> The [[spore]]s have an elliptical to oblong shape, with dimensions of 3\u20135 to 1.5\u20132.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]].<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\nIn North America, ''Phallus impudicus'' can be distinguished from the very similar ''[[Phallus hadriani|P. hadriani]]'' by the latter's purplish-tinted volva.<ref name=Davis2012/>\n\n== Spore dispersal ==\n\nThe dispersal of spores is different from most \"typical\" mushrooms that spread their [[spore]]s through the air. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass on their tip which has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of [[carrion]] to attract [[fly|flies]] and other insects. Odorous chemicals in the gleba include [[methanethiol]], [[hydrogen sulfide]],<ref name=List1967/> [[linalool]], ''trans''-[[ocimene]], [[phenylacetaldehyde]], [[dimethyl sulfide]], and [[dimethyl trisulfide]].<ref name=Borgkarlson1994/> The latter compound has been found to be emitted from [[fungating lesion|fungating]] cancerous wounds.<ref name=Shirasu2009/> The mature fruiting bodies can be smelled from a considerable distance in the woods, and at close quarters most people find the cloying stink extremely repulsive. The flies land in the gleba and in doing so collect the spore mass on their legs and carry it to other locations.<ref name=Hall2003/> An Austrian study demonstrated that [[Blow-fly|blow-flies]] (species ''[[Calliphora vicina]]'', ''[[Lucilia caesar]]'', ''Lucilia ampullacea'' and ''[[Dryomyza anilis]]'') also feed on the slime, and soon after leaving the fruit body, they deposit liquid feces that contain a dense suspension of spores.<ref name=Schremmer1963/> The study also showed that beetles (''Oeceoptoma thoracica'' and ''Meligethes viridescens'') are attracted to the fungus, but seem to have less of a role in spore dispersal as they tend to feed on the hyphal tissue of the fruiting body.\n\nThere is also a possible ecological association between the ''P.&nbsp;impudicus'' and [[badger]] (''Meles meles'') [[sett]]s.<ref name=Sleeman1995/> Fruiting bodies are commonly clustered in a zone {{convert|24|to|39|m|ft}} from the entrances;<ref name=Sleeman1996/> the setts typically harbor a regularly-available supply of badger cadavers &ndash; the mortality rate of cubs is high, and death is more likely to occur within the sett.<ref name=Clark1996/> The fruiting of large numbers of stinkhorns attracts a high population of blowflies (''Calliphora'' and ''Lucilla'' breed on carrion);<ref name=Hancox1991/> this ensures the rapid elimination of badger carcasses, removing a potential source of disease to the badger colony. The [[laxative]] effect of the gleba reduces the distance from the fruiting body to where the spores are deposited, ensuring the continued production of high densities of stinkhorns.<ref name=Sleeman1996/>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\nThe common stinkhorn can be found throughout much of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], and it has also been collected in Asia (including [[China]],<ref name=Bau1984/> Taiwan,<ref name=Hosaka2010/> and [[India]]<ref name=Khare1976/>), [[Costa Rica]],<ref name=Saenz1982/> [[Iceland]],<ref name=Hallgrimsson1992/> [[Tanzania]],<ref name=Calonge1997/> and southeast [[Australia]].<ref name=Orchard1996/> In North America, it is most common west of the [[Mississippi River]]; Ravenel's stinkhorn (''[[Phallus ravenelii]]'') is more common to the east.<ref name=Dickinson1979/> The fungus is associated with rotting wood, and as such it is most commonly encountered in [[deciduous]] woods where it fruits from summer to late autumn, though it may also be found in [[Pinophyta|conifer]] woods or even grassy areas such as parks and gardens.<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> It may also form [[mycorrhizal]] associations with certain trees.<ref name=Andersson1989/>\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Edibility ===\n\nAt the egg stage, pieces of the inner layer (the ''receptaculum'') can be cut out with a knife and eaten raw.<ref name=Bon1987/> They are crisp and crunchy with an attractive radishy taste.<ref name=Schaechter1998/> The fungus is enjoyed and eaten in [[France]] and parts of [[Germany]], where it may be sold fresh or pickled and used in [[sausage]]s.<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> Similar species are consumed in China.\n\n=== Medicinal properties ===\n\n[[Venous thrombosis]], the formation of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on [[anticoagulant]]s for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from ''P.&nbsp;impudicus'' can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of [[platelet]] aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive preventive nutrition.<ref name=Kuznecova2007/> It was used in medieval times as a cure for [[gout]] and as a love potion.<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/>\n\n=== Folk uses ===\n\nIn Northern [[Montenegro]], peasants rub ''Phallus impudicus'' on the necks of bulls before [[bull fighting]] contests in an attempt to make them stronger. They are also fed to young bulls as they are thought to be a potent [[aphrodisiac]].<ref name=Niksic2004/>\n\nIn 1777, the reverend John Lightfoot wrote that the people of [[Thuringia]] called the unopened stinkhorns \"ghost's or daemon's eggs\" and dried and powdered them before mixing them in spirits as an aphrodisiac.<ref name=lightfoot>{{cite book | title=Flora Scotica: or, a systematic arrangement, in the Linnaean method, of the native plants of Scotland and the Hebrides | first=John | last=Lightfoot | volume= 2 | pages=1046\u201347 | location=London |publisher= B. White | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/18951434}}</ref>\n\n==In culture==\nWriting about life in Victorian Cambridge, Gwen Raverat (granddaughter of [[Charles Darwin]]) describes the 'sport' of Stinkhorn hunting: <blockquote>In our native woods there grows a kind of toadstool, called in the vernacular ''The Stinkhorn'', though in Latin it bears a grosser name. The name is justified, for the fungus can be hunted by the scent alone; and this was Aunt Etty's great invention. Armed with a basket and a pointed stick, and wearing special hunting cloak and gloves, she would sniff her way round the wood, pausing here and there, her nostrils twitching, when she caught a whiff of her prey; then at last, with a deadly pounce, she would fall upon her victim, and poke his putrid carcass into her basket. At the end of the day's sport, the catch was brought back and burnt in the deepest secrecy on the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; ''because of the morals of the maids''.<ref name=Raverat1952/></blockquote>\n\nIn Thomas Mann's novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'' (''Der Zauberberg''), the psychologist Dr. Krokowski gives a lecture on the ''phallus impudicus'': <blockquote> And Dr. Krokowski had spoken about one fungus, famous since classical antiquity for its form and the powers ascribed to it -- a morel, its Latin name ending in the adjective ''impudicus'', its form reminiscent of love, and its odor, of death. For the stench given off by the ''impudicus'' was strikingly like that of a decaying corpse, the odor coming from greenish, viscous slime that carried its spores and dripped from the bell-shaped cap. And even today, among the uneducated, this morel was thought to be an aphrodisiac.<ref name=Mann1995>Thomas Mann (1995). ''The Magic Mountain'', translated by John E. Woods. New York: Alfred A.

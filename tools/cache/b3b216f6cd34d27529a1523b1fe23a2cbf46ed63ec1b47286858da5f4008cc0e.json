Widely distributed across [[Europe]], but now sprouting in other parts of the world, ''A.&nbsp;phalloides'' forms [[mycorrhiza#Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhiza]]s with various broadleaved trees. In some cases, the death cap has been introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native species of [[oak]], [[chestnut]], and [[Pinus|pine]]. The large fruiting bodies ([[mushroom]]s) appear in summer and autumn; the [[Pileus (mycology)|caps]] are generally greenish in colour with a white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] and [[Lamella (mycology)|gill]]s.  Cap colour is variable, including white forms (see Taxonomy below), and thus not a reliable identifier.\n\nThese toxic mushrooms resemble several edible species (most notably [[Caesar's mushroom]] and the [[Volvariella volvacea|straw mushroom]]) commonly consumed by humans, increasing the risk of accidental [[poison]]ing. [[Amatoxin]]s, the class of toxins found in these mushrooms, are [[Thermostability|thermostable]]: they resist changes due to heat, so their toxic effects are not reduced by cooking.\n\n''A.&nbsp;phalloides'' is one of the most poisonous of all known mushrooms. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from [[mushroom poisoning]],<ref name=\"benjamin200\">Benjamin, p.200.</ref> possibly including the deaths of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Claudius]] in AD 54 and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1740. It has been the subject of much research, and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is [[alpha-amanitin|\u03b1-amanitin]], which damages the [[liver]] and [[kidneys]], causing hepatic and renal failure that can be fatal.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe death cap is named in Latin as such in the correspondence between the English physician [[Thomas Browne]] and [[Christopher Merrett]].<ref>' The ''fungi '''Phalloides'''\" I found not very far from Norwich, large and very fetid......I have a part of one dried still by me.

These were either accidental poisonings or [[assassination]] plots. Alleged victims of this kind of poisoning include [[Claudius|Roman Emperor Claudius]], [[Pope Clement VII]], the Russian tsaritsa [[Natalia Naryshkina]], and [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]].<ref name=\"wasson\">{{cite journal|last=Wasson|first=Robert Gordon| year=1972| title=The death of Claudius, or mushrooms for murderers|journal=Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University| volume=23| issue=3|pages=101\u2013128|issn=0006-8098|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/31872#page/124}}</ref>\n\n[[R. Gordon Wasson]] recounted<ref name=\"wasson\"/> the details of these deaths, noting the likelihood of ''Amanita'' poisoning. In the case of Clement VII, the illness that led to his death lasted five months, making the case inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning (p.&nbsp;110). [[Natalia Naryshkina]] is said to have consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms prior to her death. It is unclear whether the mushrooms themselves were poisonous or if she succumbed to [[food poisoning]].\n\n[[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] experienced [[indigestion]] after eating a dish of [[Saut\u00e9ing|saut\u00e9ed]] mushrooms. This led to an illness from which he died 10 days later\u2014symptomatology consistent with amatoxin poisoning. His death led to the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. Noted [[Voltaire]], \"this dish of mushrooms changed the destiny of Europe.\"<ref name=\"wasson\"/><ref name=\"benjamin35\">Benjamin, p.35</ref>\n\nThe case of [[Claudius]]' poisoning is more complex. Claudius was known to have been very fond of eating [[Amanita caesarea|Caesar's mushroom]]. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of Caesar's mushrooms. Ancient authors, such as [[Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]], are unanimous about poison having been added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculated the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose of an unknown poison (possibly a variety of [[nightshade]]) being administered later during his illness.<ref name=\"wasson\"/><ref name=\"benjamin33\">Benjamin, pp.33\u201334</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n*[[List of deadly fungi]]\n*[[Mushroom poisoning]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Cited texts===\n*{{cite book |last=Benjamin| first= Denis R. |title=Mushrooms: Poisons and Panaceas\u2014A Handbook for Naturalists, Mycologists and Physicians |publisher=WH Freeman and Company |location=New York |year=1995| isbn=978-0-7167-2600-5}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Jordan |first1=Peter |last2=Wheeler |first2=Steven | year=2001 | title=The Ultimate Mushroom Book | location=London |publisher=Hermes House | isbn = 978-1-85967-092-7}}\n*{{cite book|last=Zeitlmayr|first= Linus|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms: An Illustrated Handbook |publisher=Garden City Press|location=Hertfordshire|isbn= 978-0-584-10324-3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|en-Amanita_phalloides.ogg|2007-09-14}}\n{{Commons|Amanita phalloides}}\n*[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2978434/One-woman-dead-and-another-seriously-ill-after-eating-Death-Cap-mushrooms.html UK Telegraph Newspaper (September 2008) - One woman dead, another critically ill after eating Death Cap fungi]\n* [http://americanmushrooms.com/deathcap.htm AmericanMushrooms.com - The Death Cap Mushroom ''Amanita phalloides'']\n* [http://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita_phalloides.html ''Amanita phalloides'': the death cap]\n* [http://www.bayareamushrooms.org/mushroommonth/amanita_phalloides.html ''Amanita phalloides'': Invasion of the Death Cap]\n* [http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/key.dir/phallimb.html Key to species of ''Amanita'' Section ''Phalloideae'' from North and Central America - ''Amanita'' studies website]\n* [http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Amanita_phalloides.html California Fungi\u2014Amanita phalloides]\n* [http://www.anbg.gov.au/fungi/deathcap.html Death cap in Australia - ANBG website]\n* [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7251327 On the Trail of the Death Cap Mushroom] from National Public Radio\n* {{EOL}}\n\n{{Poisonous Amanitas}}\n{{Amanitas}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q188643}}\n{{Featured article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amanita Phalloides}}\n[[Category:Amanita|phalloides]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Africa]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Deadly fungi]]\n[[Category:Hepatotoxins]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1821]]\n[[Category:Fungi naturalized in Australia]]"}]}}}}

It is mostly white, with ochraceous or brownish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] markings, and a short robust [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. It is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but poor in taste, and grows in coniferous, broadleaved, or [[mixed forest|mixed woods]]. It can be confused with other white ''[[Russula]]'' species and certain white ''[[Lactarius]]'' species.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst described by the Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838, its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''delica'' is [[Latin]] for \"weaned\".<ref name=nilper>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page=112}}</ref> Older names include [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]]'s ''Lactarius piperatus'' var.

As a result, the [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] often trap the surrounding leaf debris and soil on their rough surfaces. The cap can be {{convert|16|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. It is white, usually tinged with ochre or brown, with an inrolled margin, which usually remains white.  At first it is convex, but later flattens, and is often funnel shaped.  The firm, white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is short and stout, measuring 2\u20136&nbsp;cm (0.8\u20132.4&nbsp;in) high and 2\u20134&nbsp;cm (0.8\u20131.6&nbsp;in) wide. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[decurrent]], and are quite closely spaced initially. The [[spore print]]  is creamy white, and the warty oval spores measure 8\u201312 x 7\u20139&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, and does not change colour on cutting. It has a pleasant, fruity smell when young, but at maturity it may develop a faintly fishy or unpleasant smell.<ref>Loizides M, Kyriakou T, Tziakouris A. (2011).

It can be separated by the turquoise band at the apex (at the attachment of the gills with the cap) and by its unpleasant, peppery smell.\n\n''[[Russula pallidospora]]'' is another similar species, which has very tough flesh, more distant gills and an ochraceous spore deposit.\n\n''[[Russula flavispora]]'' is also similar but rare, and has dense gills and a deep ochraceous spore deposit.\n\nSimilar whitish milk-cap species, such as ''[[Lactifluus piperatus]]'' all exude milk from the gills, and the cut flesh.<ref name=Haas69>{{cite book | last = Haas |first=Hans | year = 1969 | title = The Young Specialist looks at Fungi |page= 74| publisher = Burke | isbn= 0-222-79409-7}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Russula delica'' is widespread in the northern [[temperate]] zones, including [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].<ref name=Phillips06/> It is particularly common in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]].

Along with ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe aztecorum]]'', it is one of the mushrooms likely to have been used by the [[Aztec]]s and is currently used by [[Mazatec]] shamans for its [[entheogen]]ic properties.\n\n== Description ==\nThe taste and smell of ''Psilocybe caerulescens'' are strongly [[farinaceous]], reminiscent of cucumber, though the smell lessens with age or when dry.\n\n[[File:Psilocybe.caerulescens.spores.1000x.dic.JPG|thumb|''Psilocybe caerulescens'' spores]]\n\n== Cap ==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is (1)3\u20137(10) cm broad. [[Wikt:convex|Convex]] to obtusely [[wikt:campanulate|campanulate]] with an incurved margin at first, rarely becoming plane, and often are [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]] or with a slight depression in the center. It is [[wikt:viscid|viscid]] when moist from a separable gelatinous [[Pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]]. The margin is slightly translucent-striate when moist. The cap is [[hygrophanous]], yellowish brown to reddish brown with a silvery-blue metallic luster, paler at the margin, and drying to a beige or straw yellow. It readily bruises blue when handled, the younger specimens bruising bluish olivacous or even blackish. The cap often has a great variation in color and form.\n\n== Gills ==\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[adnation|adnate]] to [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]] and close to subclose. They are whitish, yellowish grey when young, becoming dark [[wikt:violaceous|violaceous]] brown to sepia brown with age; the edges remain slightly whitish.<br>\n''Psilocybe caerulescens'' [[spore]]s are dark violaceous brown.\n\n== Stipe ==\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is (2)5\u20139(13) cm long and (5)8\u201310(12) mm thick. It is equal or enlarging slightly at the base, and is somewhat flexous, hollow, and [[wikt:subpruinose|subpruinose]] to [[wikt:floccose|floccose]]. The stipe is whitish to reddish brown or blackish and readily bruises blue. [[mycelial cord|Rhizomorphs]] are sometimes attached to the base. The [[veil (botany)|veil]] is well-developed but does not form a permanent [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]].\n\n=== Microscopic Features ===\nThe [[spore]]s are [[wikt:hexaganal|hexagonal]] to [[wikt:subrhomboid|subrhomboid]] in frontal view and [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] in side view, (5.6)6.7\u20138(9) x (4) 4.8\u20136.4 (7.2) x 4\u20134.8 (5.5) [[\u00b5m]]. The [[basidium|basidia]] each produce four spores, and occasionally only two larger spores. The [[cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] are 16\u201327(29) x 4.5\u20138 [[\u00b5m]] and lageniform to narrowly lageniform, with a flexuous neck that is 1\u20132.5 [[\u00b5m]] broad and sometimes bifurcate.  Basidia 18.5\u201322.5 \u00d7 5.5\u20136.5 [[\u00b5m]], cylindrical, four spored, hyaline and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia 12\u201320 (\u201332) \u00d7 4.5\u20139 (\u201210) [[\u00b5m]], fusiform, occasionally conical, clavate or utriform, occasionally bifurcate, hyaline, thin-walled.  The subhymenium is ramose-inflated. Pileus trama is radial, with hyphae 5\u201332 [[\u00b5m]], yellowish to yellowish brown, thick walled (0.5\u20131 [[\u00b5m]]). Pileipellis an ixocutis, (9\u2013) 12\u201354 [[\u00b5m]] wide, hyphae 1.5\u20134 (\u20135.5) [[\u00b5m]] diameter, hyaline and thin-walled. Pileocystidia (10\u2013) 12\u201328 \u00d7 4\u20139.5 [[\u00b5m]], globose, cylindrical, clavate, flexuose or pyriform and thin-walled.  Stipitipellis a cutis, hyphae 1.5\u20139.5 [[\u00b5m]] diameter, yellowish brown, thin-walled (up to 0.5\u20130.8 [[\u00b5m]] thick). Caulocystidia (19\u2013) 22.5\u201349.5 (\u201356) \u00d7 4\u20138 (\u20139.5) [[\u00b5m]], cylindrical, lageniform, fusiform or, utriform, or lageniform, hyaline and, thin-walled.\n\n== Habitat and formation ==\n''Psilocybe caerulescens'' is found growing [[wikt:gregarious|gregariously]] or [[wikt:cespitose|cespitosely]], rarely solitarily, from June through October on disturbed  ground often devoid of herbaceous plants. It often grows in sunny locations, preferring muddy orangish brown soils with lots of woody debris. ''Psilocybe caerulescens'' was first reported from near [[Montgomery, Alabama]], by Murrill in 1923 on sugarcane mulch, not re-documented from that locality since. It was recently found in [[South Carolina]] in September 2008. ''Psilocybe caerulescens'' is common and widespread throughout northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Found in N. Georgia in 2000.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Psilocybin mushrooms]]\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nImage:Psilocybe.caerulescens.SEmushroomHunter.jpg|''Psilocybe caerulescens''\nImage:Psilocybe.caerulescens.Jalisco.jpg|''Psilocybe caerulescens''\nImage:Psilocybe.caerulescens.Jalisco.1.jpg|''Psilocybe caerulescens''\nFile:Psilocybe caerulescens -Costa Rica.jpg|''Psilocybe caerulescens from grassland'' \nFile:Psilocybe.caerulescens.Jalisco-2.jpg|''Psilocybe caerulescens from forest floor''\n</gallery>\n\n{{Hallucinogenic mushrooms}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q7255854}}\n\n[[Category:Entheogens]]\n[[Category:Psychoactive fungi]]\n[[Category:Psilocybe|caerulescens]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic tryptamine carriers]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of South America]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by William Alphonso Murrill]]"}]}}}}

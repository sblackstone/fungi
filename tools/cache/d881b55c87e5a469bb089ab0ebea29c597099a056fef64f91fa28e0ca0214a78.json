First described as a member of the [[genus]] ''[[Boletus]]'' in 1874, the [[species]] acquired several [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]], including ''Suillus pinorigidus'' and ''Suillus subluteus'', before it was assigned its current [[binomial name]] in 1983. It has not been determined with certainty whether ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor'' is distinct from the species ''[[Suillus cothurnatus|S.&nbsp;cothurnatus]]'', described by [[Rolf Singer]] in 1945. ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus\u2014meaning it forms a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] association with the [[root]]s of plants such that both organisms benefit from the exchange of nutrients. This symbiosis occurs with various species of [[pine]], and the [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] (or [[mushroom]]s) of the fungus appear scattered or in groups on the ground near the trees. The fungus is found in North America, [[Hawaii]], Asia, the Caribbean, South Africa, [[Flora of Australia|Australia]] and Central America. It has been [[introduced species|introduced]] to several of those locations via transplanted trees.\n\nThe mushroom's dingy yellow to brownish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is rounded to flattened in shape, slimy when wet, and grows up to {{convert|9.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The small pores on the underside of the cap are yellow before becoming olive-brown. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick and is covered with reddish-brown glandular dots. Young specimens are covered with a grayish, slimy [[partial veil]] that later ruptures and leaves a sheathlike [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the stem. Although the mushroom is generally considered [[edible mushroom|edible]]\u2014especially if the slimy [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] and partial veil are first peeled off\u2014opinions about its palatability vary. Other similar ''[[Suillus]]'' species include ''[[Suillus acidus|S.&nbsp;acidus]]'', ''[[Suillus subalutaceus|S.&nbsp;subalutaceus]]'', and ''[[Suillus intermedius|S.&nbsp;intermedius]]''.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically by American [[mycologist]] [[Charles Christopher Frost]] in 1874 as ''Boletus salmonicolor'', based on specimens he collected in the [[New England]] area of the United States.<ref name=Frost1874 /> In a 1983 publication, mycologist [[Roy Halling]] declared ''Boletus subluteus'' (described by [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1887;<ref name=Peck1887 /> ''Ixocomus subluteus'' is a later combination based on this name<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Ixocomus subluteus\" />) and ''Suillus pinorigidus'' (described by [[Wally Snell]] and Esther A. Dick in 1956<ref name=Snell1956 />) to be [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]]. Halling also reexamined Frost's [[type (biology)|type]] specimen of ''B.&nbsp;salmonicolor'', and considered the [[taxon]] better placed in ''Suillus'' because of its glutinous cap, dotted stem, and [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]; he formally transferred it to that genus, resulting in the combination ''Suillus salmonicolor''.<ref name=Halling1983 /> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''salmonicolor'' is a [[Latin]] color term meaning \"pink with a dash of yellow\".<ref name=Stearn2004 /> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"slippery Jill\".<ref name=\"Boletes NAm, pp.250-1\">Bessette ''et al.''

Palm}} and {{nowrap|Elwin L. Stewart}} further discussed the synonymy of ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor'', ''S.&nbsp;subluteus'', and ''S.&nbsp;pinorigidus''. They noted that [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''S.&nbsp;subluteus'' collected in Minnesota did not have the strong salmon colors considered characteristic of ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor'', as well as collections that had been named ''S.&nbsp;pinorigidus''; this is a [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] difference that could be sufficient to consider ''S.&nbsp;subluteus'' a distinct species. They explained that although the microscopic characteristics of the three taxa do not differ significantly, this is not unusual for ''Suillus'' and cannot be used as the sole proof of [[conspecificity]]. Palm and Stewart concluded that a study of specimens from various areas of their geographical ranges would be needed to fully resolve the taxonomy of these related species.<ref name=Palm1986 />\n\nThere is some disagreement in the literature about whether ''[[Suillus cothurnatus]]'' represents a different species from ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor''. The online mycological taxonomy database [[MycoBank]] lists them as synonyms,<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Suillus salmonicolor\" /> contrary to [[Index Fungorum]].<ref name=\"urlFungorum synonymy\" /> In their 2000 [[monograph]] of North American boletes, [[Alan Bessette]] and colleagues list the two taxa separately, noting that the range of ''S.&nbsp;cothurnatus'' is difficult to determine because of confusion with ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor''.<ref>Bessette ''et al.'' (2000), p. 234.</ref> In a [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analyses of ''Suillus'' [[phylogeny]], based on the [[internal transcribed spacer]], ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor'' (as ''S.&nbsp;subluteus'') and ''S.&nbsp;intermedius'' clustered together very closely, indicating a high degree of [[genetic similarity]].<ref name=Kretzer1996 /><ref name=Kretzer1997 /> These analyses were based on comparing the [[nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] differences in a single region of [[ribosomal DNA]]; more recent molecular analyses typically combine the analysis of several genes to increase the validity of inferences drawn.<ref name=Wang2009 />\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Suillus salmonicolor 167980.jpg|thumb|left|The orange flesh and booted slimy veil are distinctive characteristics of the mushroom.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor'' is bluntly rounded or convex to nearly flattened, reaching a diameter of {{convert|3|\u2013|9.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The cap surface is sticky to slimy when moist, but becomes shiny when dry. The cap color is variable, ranging from dingy yellow to yellowish-orange to [[ochre|ochraceous]]-[[salmon (color)|salmon]], cinnamon-brown or olive-brown to yellow-brown. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is pale orange-yellow to orange-[[buff (color)|buff]] or orange, and does not stain when exposed to air. The odor and taste are not distinctive. The pore surface on the underside of the cap is yellow to dingy yellow, or yellowish orange to salmon, darkening to brownish with age; it also does not stain when bruised. The pores are circular to angular, measuring 1\u20132 per mm and {{convert|8|\u2013|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} deep. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|2.5|\u2013|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|6|\u2013|16|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and either equal in width throughout or slightly enlarged in the lower portion. It is whitish to yellowish or pinkish-ochre, and has reddish-brown to dark brown glandular dots and smears on the surface. Glandular dots are made of clumps of [[pigment]]ed cells, and, unlike [[wikt:reticulation|reticulation]] or scabers (small visible tufts of fibers that occur on the stems of other ''Suillus'' species), can be rubbed off with handling. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is ochraceous to yellowish, often salmon-orange at the base of the stem. The [[partial veil]] that protects the developing gills is initially thick, baggy, and rubbery. It often has a conspicuously thickened cottony roll of tissue at its base, and sometimes flares outward from the stem on the lower portion. It forms a gelatinous [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the upper to middle part of the stem. The [[spore print]] is cinnamon-brown to brown.<ref name=\"Boletes NAm, pp.250-1\" /> The surface of the cap, when applied with a drop of dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) or [[ammonium hydroxide|ammonia solution]] (chemical reagents commonly used for [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|mushroom identification]]), will first turn a fleeting pink color, then dark red as the flesh collapses.<ref name=Baroni1970 />\n\nThe [[spore]]s are smooth, roughly [[ellipsoid]] in shape, inequilateral when viewed in profile, and measure 7.6\u201310 by 3\u20133.4&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. They appear [[hyaline]] (translucent) to yellowish in a dilute solution of KOH, and cinnamon to pale [[ochre|ochraceous]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] are somewhat collapsed, hyaline, and 5\u20136&nbsp;\u03bcm thick. The [[cystidia]] are scattered, sometimes arranged in clusters (especially on the gill edge), usually with an ochraceous-brown content, but occasionally hyaline. They are club-shaped to somewhat cylindric and measure 34\u201360 by 10\u201313&nbsp;\u03bcm. The [[pileipellis|cuticle]] of the cap is an ixotrichodermium\u2014a cellular arrangement where the outermost hyphae are gelatinous and emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are hyaline and narrowly cylindric, measuring 1.4\u20133&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. The stem surface is made of scattered bundles of caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are brown or sometimes hyaline in KOH, club-shaped to [[subcylindrical]] bundles interspersed among hyaline cells. These bundles are underlain by a layer of gelatinous, hyaline, vertically oriented and parallel hyphae that are shaped like narrow cylinders. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent from the hyphae.<ref name=Halling1983 />\n\n===Edibility===\nThe mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but removal of the slimy cap cuticle and partial veil is recommended to avoid possible [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] upset;<ref name=Bessette2001 /> similarly, the 1992 field guide ''Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America'' recommends the removal of the tube layer before preparation, as it can become slimy during cooking.<ref name=Bessette1992 /> Opinions about the quality of the mushroom vary. According to the book ''Boletes of North America'', it is \"very good\" with a \"lemony\" flavor.<ref name=\"Boletes NAm, pp.250-1\" /> A Canadian field guide is more cautious in its assessment, and suggests that one would have to be brave to consume a mushroom with such a sticky veil.<ref>\"Il faudrait une bonne dose of courage pour passer outre l'aspect assez repoussant que pr\u00e9sente le voile partiel tr\u00e8s gluant de ce champignon.\" Sicard and Lamoureux (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ8164vllNIC&pg=PA140 p. 140.]</ref> Mycologist [[David Arora]], in his ''[[Mushrooms Demystified]]'', opines that it is not worth eating.<ref name=Arora1986 /> Whatever its palatibility to humans, the mushroom serves as a habitat for [[larva]]e of [[fungivore|mycophagous]] insects such as the [[Muscidae|muscid fly]] ''[[Mydaea discimana]]'' and the [[scuttle fly]] ''[[Megaselia lutea]]''.<ref name=Bruns1984 />\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| align = right\n| image1 = Suillus acidus 110096.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (140 * 800 / 600) round 0}}\n| caption1 = ''Suillus acidus''\n| image2 = Suillus acidus 56776.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (140 * 2272 / 1704) round 0}}\n| caption2 = ''Suillus intermedius''\n}}\n''[[Suillus intermedius]]'', found in northeastern and northern North America,<ref name=\"urlKuo\" /> is similar in appearance to ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor''. It may be distinguished by a lighter-colored cap, cream to yellowish or pale ochraceous flesh, and a ring that is neither as thick nor as wide as ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor''.<ref name=Roody2003 /> It is also larger, with a cap diameter of up to {{convert|16|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and its pore surface sometimes slowly stains reddish-brown when bruised.<ref>Bessette ''et al.'' (2000), pp. 240\u20131.</ref> Although it has not been definitively established whether ''[[Suillus cothurnatus|S.&nbsp;cothurnatus]]'' is a distinct species, several characteristics have been reported to differentiate it from ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor'': a thinner, less rubbery veil that usually lacks a thickened cottony roll at the base; glandular dots on the stem that consist of bundles of [[septum|multiseptate]] hyphae in a parallel arrangement ending in an even row of large, sterile cystidia (60\u2013140&nbsp;\u03bcm long) that resemble basidia; and small hyaline cystidia shaped like swollen bottles with narrowed bases.<ref>Bessette ''et al.'' (2000), pp. 233\u20134.</ref> Other ''Suillus'' species with which ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor'' might be confused include ''[[Suillus acidus|S.&nbsp;acidus]]'' and ''[[Suillus subalutaceus|S.&nbsp;subalutaceus]]''. Both of these species have a less well-developed partial veil, and their flesh is a duller tone lacking yellow-orange tints.<ref name=Sicard2005>Sicard and Lamoureux (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ8164vllNIC&pg=PA140 p. 140.]</ref>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\n''Suillus salmonicolor'' occurs in a [[mycorrhiza]]l association with various species of ''[[pine|Pinus]]''. This is a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship in which the subterranean fungal [[mycelium|mycelia]] creates a protective sheath around the rootlets of the tree and a network of hyphae (the [[Hartig net]]) that penetrates between the tree's epidermal and cortical cells. This association helps the plant absorb water and [[dietary mineral|mineral]] nutrients; in exchange, the fungus receives a supply of [[carbohydrate]]s produced by the plant's [[photosynthesis]]. Two-, three-, and five-needled pines have all been recorded to associate with ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor''. In North America, the fungus has been found growing with ''[[Pinus banksiana|P.&nbsp;banksiana]]'', ''[[Pinus palustris|P.&nbsp;palustris]]'', ''[[Pinus resinosa|P.&nbsp;resinosa]]'', ''[[Pinus rigida|P.&nbsp;rigida]]'', ''[[Pinus strobus|P.&nbsp;strobus]]'' and ''[[Pinus taeda|P.&nbsp;taeda]]''. In [[Kamchatka]] (in the Russian Far East) it has been found in association with ''[[Pinus pumila|P.&nbsp;pumila]]'', in the [[Philippines]] with ''[[Pinus kesiya|P.&nbsp;kesiya]]'',<ref name=Reid2000 /> and in southern India with ''[[Pinus patula|P.&nbsp;patula]]''.<ref name=Natarajan1983 /> The northern limit of its North American range is eastern Canada ([[Quebec]]),<ref name=Sicard2005 /> and the southern limit is [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]<ref name=Garcia1981 /> and near Nabogame in [[Tem\u00f3sachi Municipality]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Mexico.<ref name=Laferriere1992 />\n\n''Suillus salmonicolor'' has been collected from the [[Dominican Republic]] in the Caribbean,<ref name=OrtizSantana2007 /> Japan,<ref name=Murata1976 /> Taiwan,<ref name=Hongo1985 /> and from [[Mpumalanga]], South Africa. Because there are no native ''Pinus'' species in South Africa, the fungus is assumed to be an exotic species that has been [[introduced species|introduced]] via [[pine plantation]]s.<ref name=Reid2000 /> It has also been introduced to Australia, where it is known from a single collection made in a plantation of [[Caribbean pine]] (''Pinus caribaea'') in [[Queensland]],<ref name=Leonard2010 /> and has been found growing with Caribbean pine in [[Belize]].<ref name=Kropp2001 /> It is found in Hawaii under [[Slash Pine]] (''Pinus elliotii''), including lawns where those trees are used in [[landscaping]].<ref name=Hemmes2002 /> ''S.&nbsp;salmonicolor'' is one of several ectomycorrhizal species that have \"traveled the thousands of kilometers from a mainland to Hawaii in the roots and soil of introduced seedlings.\"<ref name=Vellinga2009 />\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of North American boletes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |page=500 |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Baroni1970>{{cite journal |author=Baroni TJ. |year=1970 |title=Chemical spot-test reactions: boletes |journal=Mycologia |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=1064\u201376 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0070/005/1064.htm |jstor=3759138 |doi=10.2307/3759138}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette1992>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette A, Fischer DH |year=1992 |title=Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America: a Field-to-Kitchen Guide |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin, Texas |page=106 |isbn=978-0-292-72080-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsJN7NZutTAC&pg=PA106}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette2001>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette AR, Bessette AE, Neill WJ |title=Mushrooms of Cape Cod and the National Seashore |year=2001 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |page=43 |isbn=978-0-8156-0687-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bycZa1YVNuwC&pg=PA43}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bruns1984>{{cite book |author=Bruns T. |year=1984 |chapter=Insect mycophagy in the Boletales: fungivore diversity and the mushroom habitat |veditors=Blackwell M, Wheeler Q |title=Fungus\u2013Insect Relationships: Perspectives in Ecology and Evolution |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York City |pages=91\u2013129 (see pp.&nbsp;120 and 122) |isbn=978-0-231-05695-3 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McUWyL0wsh8C&pg=PA122}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Frost1874>{{cite journal |author=Frost CC. |year=1874 |title=Catalogue of boleti of New England, with descriptions of new species |journal=Bulletin of the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences |volume=2 |pages=100\u20135 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/5000695}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Garcia1981>{{cite journal |vauthors=Garc\u00eda J, Castillo J |year=1981 |title=Species of Boletaceae and Gomphidiaceae fungi known in Nuevo Le\u00f3n Mexico |journal=Bolet\u00edn de la Sociedad Mexicana de Micologia |volume=15 |pages=121\u201398 |language=Spanish |issn=0085-6223}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Halling1983>{{cite journal |author=Halling RE. |year=1984 |title=Boletes described by Charles C.

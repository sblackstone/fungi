It is relatively large for a jelly fungus, and can reach up to ten centimetres in height.<ref>http://www.first-nature.com/fungi/calocera-viscosa.php First Nature, retrieved 16 August 2012</ref> It is widespread and common, and its bright colour makes it stand out in its habitat. It grows on decaying [[conifer]] wood, typically stumps and roots, although this may not be obvious if the wood is covered in leaf litter. It fruits throughout the year, but is most commonly seen in autumn.\n\nIt is not poisonous, but its tough gelatinous texture and nondescript taste and odour make it unattractive as a food. Its striking colour has led to it being used as a garnish on occasion, however.<ref>http://www.mushroomdiary.co.uk/2011/10/yellow-stagshorn-fungus/ Mushroom Diary, retrieved 16 August 2012</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q256970}}\n\n[[Category:Dacrymycetes]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1827]]\n\n\n{{Basidiomycota-stub}}"}]}}}}

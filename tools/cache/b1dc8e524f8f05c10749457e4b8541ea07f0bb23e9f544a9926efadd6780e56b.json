It contains the [[hallucinogenic]] compounds [[psilocybin]], [[psilocin]] and [[baeocystin]].\nThe species is [[common name|commonly]] known by various names such as bottle caps, knobby tops, blue bells, olive caps.\n\n==Etymology and history==\n*From the Greek words ''baeo'' (little) and ''kystis'' (bladder)\n*1945 ''P. baeocystis'' is first collected in [[Eugene, Oregon]].<ref name=\"Singer&Smith1958\"/>\n*1958 ''P. baeocystis'' is formally described and published by Singer and Smith.<ref name=\"Singer&Smith1958\"/>\n*1962 [[Psilocin]] is first reported in this species.<ref name=\"pmid13867140\"/>\n*1967-68 [[Baeocystin]]<ref name=\"pmid6067681\"/> and [[norbaeocystin]]<ref name=\"pmid5684732\"/> are discovered and named.\n*1981 Testing again reveals [[psilocybin]], [[psilocin]], [[baeocystin]] and [[norbaeocystin]].<ref name=\"pmid7194879\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is 1.5\u20135.5&nbsp;cm in diameter and [[conic]] to obtusely conic to [[wikt:convex|convex]]. The cap margin is turned inwards when young, rarely becoming plane in age, often distinctly rippled, translucent-striate and bruising and aging greenish-bluish about the margin. It is dark olive brown to buff brown in color, occasionally steel blue; when dried it tends toward copper brown in the center. It is [[hygrophanous]], fading to milk white, and viscid when moist from a gelatinous [[Pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]], usually separable. The flesh is thin and bruises blue easily. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are close with [[Lamella (mycology)|adnate]] to [[Lamella (mycology)|sinuate]] attachment and are grayish to cinnamon brown, with the edges remaining pallid. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 5\u20137&nbsp;cm long, 2\u20133&nbsp;mm thick, and equal to [[wikt:subequal|subequal]]. The color is pallid to brownish with white filaments, while often more yellowish towards the apex. Distinct [[mycelial cord|rhizomorph]]s are found at the base. The stipe is brittle, stuffed with loose fibers, and the [[partial veil]] is [[wikt:evanescent|evanescent]] and rapidly becomes indistinguishable. It stains blue easily where damaged. ''Psilocybe baeocystis'' has a [[farinaceous]] smell and taste.\n\n===Microscopic features===\n\n''Psilocybe baeocystis'' [[spore]]s are dark purplish brown in deposit, oblong in face view or asymmetric ellipsoid (mango form) in side view,  and are (8.5) 9.5\u201313.7(17) x (5) 5.5\u20136.6(7.1) [[\u03bcm]].<ref name=\"Guzman1978\"/>\nThe [[basidia]] are 4-spored, and [[pleurocystidia]] are absent. The [[cheilocystidia]] are 20\u201330(40) x 4.5\u20136(9) [[\u03bcm]] and [[wikt:fusoid|fusiod]] with a narrow neck.<ref name=\"isbn0-89815-839-7\"/>\n\nThis species is closely related to the [[subtropical]] ''[[Psilocybe aztecorum]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe quebecensis]]'', which also have caps that bleach in color to white when dry.<ref name=\"Guzman1978\" />\n\n[[File:Psilocybe.baeocystis.spores.dic.1000x.JPG|thumb|''Psilocybe baeocystis'' spores 1000x]]\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Psilocybe baeocystis'' is solitary to [[wikt:cespitose|cespitose]], and scattered to numerous on ground bark, wood chips, [[peat moss]], decaying conifer mulch, occasionally on lawns, pastures, and rarely in [[coniferous forest]]s. Often found growing under plants like [[rhododendrons]] and rose bushes in mulched garden beds, sometimes growing amongst other ''Psilocybe'' species such as ''[[Psilocybe stuntzii]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe cyanescens]]''. ''Psilocybe baeocystis'' grows from August through December, and rarely as early as the end of June. ''Psilocybe baeocystis'' is a [[hemiboreal]] mushroom, common throughout the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was found in [[Maine]] in November 2007<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mushroomobserver.org/observer/show_observation/12766 |title=Observation 12766: ''Psilocybe baeocystis'' |work=Mushroom Observer |date=2007-11-01}}</ref> and is reported to have been found in [[Connecticut]] also.\n\n==Biochemistry==\n[[Psilocin]] was first reported in this species in Benedict et al., 1962,<ref name=\"pmid13867140\"/> and a few years later, Leung and Paul would report the related compound [[baeocystin]], isolated from saprophytic culture,<ref name=\"pmid6067681\"/> as well as the [[desmethyl]] metabolite [[norbaeocystin]].<ref name=\"pmid5684732\"/> Beug and Bigwood (1981) also reported on the concentrations of these compounds in ''Psilocybe baeocystis'' using [[High performance liquid chromatography#Reverse Phase chromatography|reverse-phase HPLC]] and [[thin-layer chromatography]].<ref name=\"pmid7194879\"/> Concentration ranges for psychoactive compounds from these studies were reported to be 0.15\u20130.85% psilocybin, up to 0.59% psilocin, and up to 0.10% baeocystin.\n\n==Classification==\nThis mushroom has been placed in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Aztecorum'' by [[Gaston Guzman]]; other members of the section include ''[[Psilocybe aztecorum var. aztecorum]]'', ''[[Psilocybe aztecorum var. bonetii]]'', ''[[Psilocybe pseudoaztecorum]]'', and ''[[Psilocybe quebecensis]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Singer&Smith1958\">{{Cite journal |last1=Singer |first1=R. |last2=Smith |first2=A.H. |year=1958 |title=New species of ''Psilocybe'' |journal=Mycologia |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=141\u2013142 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0050/001/0141.htm |doi=10.2307/3756045}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"pmid13867140\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jps.2600510428|vauthors=Benedict RG, Brady LR, Tyler VE |title=Occurrence of psilocin in''Psilocybe baeocystis''|journal=J Pharm Sci|volume=51|issue=4|pages=393\u20134|date=April 1962|pmid=13867140}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"pmid6067681\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jps.2600560132|vauthors=Leung AY, Paul AG |title=Baeocystin, a mono-methyl analog of psilocybin from ''Psilocybe baeocystis'' saprophytic culture|journal=J Pharm Sci|volume=56|issue=1|pages=146|date=January 1967|pmid=6067681}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"pmid5684732\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jps.2600571007|vauthors=Leung AY, Paul AG |title=Baeocystin and norbaeocystin: new analogs of psilocybin from ''Psilocybe baeocystis''|journal=J Pharm Sci|volume=57|issue=10|pages=1667\u201371|date=October 1968|pmid=5684732}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"pmid7194879\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0021-9673(00)88741-5|vauthors=Beug MW, Bigwood J |title=Quantitative analysis of psilocybin and psilocin in ''Psilocybe baeocystis'' (Singer and Smith) by high-performance liquid chromatography and by thin-layer chromatography|journal=J.

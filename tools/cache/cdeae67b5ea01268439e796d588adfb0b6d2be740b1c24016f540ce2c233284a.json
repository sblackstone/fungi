It is perhaps best known under its previous name, '''''Boletus satanas''''', before the fungus was transferred to the new genus ''[[Rubroboletus]]'' in 2014, based on molecular [[phylogenetic]] data. Found in [[broad-leaved]] and mixed woodland in the warmer regions of [[Europe]], it is classified as a [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous mushroom]], known to cause gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhoea and violent vomiting. However, reports of poisoning are rare, due to its striking appearance and at times putrid smell, which discourage casual experimentation. \n\nThe squat, brightly coloured fruiting bodies are often massive and imposing, with a pale, dull-coloured velvety cap up to {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} across, yellow to orange-red pores and a bulbous red-patterned stem. The flesh turns blue when cut or bruised and overripe fruitbodies often emit an unpleasant smell reminiscent of [[carrion]]. It is arguably the largest bolete found in [[Europe]].\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\nOriginally known as ''Boletus satanas'', the Satan's bolete was described by German [[Mycology|mycologist]] Harald Othmar Lenz in 1831. Lenz was aware of several reports of adverse reactions from people who had consumed this fungus and apparently felt himself ill from its \"emanations\" while describing it, hence giving it its sinister epithet.<ref name = \"Ramsbottom53\">{{cite book | author = Ramsbottom J | year = 1953 | title = Mushrooms & Toadstools |pages=53\u201354 | publisher = Collins | isbn = 1-870630-09-2}}</ref> The [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u1fb6\u03c2}} (''satanas'', meaning [[Satan]]), is derived from the [[Hebrew]] ''\u015b\u0101\u1e6d\u0101n'' (\u05e9\u05d8\u05df).<ref name=Nilper/> American mycologist [[Harry D.

At first it is hemispherical with an inrolled margin, but becomes convex at maturity as the fruit body expands, while in older specimens the margin might be slightly undulating. When young, the pileus is greyish white to silvery-white or buff, but older specimens tend to develop olivaceous, ochraceous or brownish tinges. The surface of the cap is finely [[tomentose]], becoming smooth at maturity and is often slightly viscid in wet weather. The cuticle is tightly attached to the flesh and does not peel. <ref name=\"Courtecuisse 1995\"/><ref name=\"Estad\u00e8s 2004\"/>\n[[File:Boletus-satanas-4.jpg|thumb|left|View of stipe and pore surface]]\n\nThe free to slightly adnate tubes are up to {{convert|3|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} long, pale yellow or greenish yellow and bluing when cut. The pores (tube mouths) are rounded, yellow to orange at first, but soon turning red from the point of their attachment to the stem outwards, eventually becoming entirely purplish red or carmine-red at full maturity and instantly bluing when touched or bruised. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|5|\u2013|15|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long, distinctly bulbous ({{convert|4|\u2013|12|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and often wider than its length, becoming more ventricose as the fungus expands but remaining bulbous at the base. Its colour is golden-yellow to orange at the apex, becoming increasingly pinkish-red to reddish-orange further down and deep carmine-red to purple-red towards the base. It is decorated in a fine, yellowish to reddish hexagonal net, sometimes confined to the upper half of the stipe. The flesh is thick, spongy and whitish, but may be yellow to straw-coloured in immature specimens and is sometimes reddish at the stem base. It slowly turns a faded blue colour when cut, bluing more intensely around the apex and above the tubes. The smell is weak and pleasantly musky in young fruit bodies, but becomes increasingly putrid in older specimens, reminiscent of carrion.<ref name=\"Galli 2007\"/> Young specimens have a reportedly pleasant, nutty taste.<ref name=Zeitl76>{{cite book|author=Zeitlmayr L|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms:An Illustrated Handbook|publisher=Garden City Press, Hertfordshire|isbn=0-584-10324-7|page=102}}</ref> The [[spore print]] is olivaceous green.<ref name=\"Kibby 2016\"/> \n\nThe spores are fusiform (spindle-shaped) when viewed under a microscope and measure 10\u201316 \u00d7 4.5\u20137.5 \u03bcm.

In [[Europe]], it mostly occurs in the southern regions and is rare or absent in northern countries. It fruits in the summer and early autumn in warm, [[broad-leaved]] and mixed forests, forming [[ectomycorrhizal]] associations with oak (''[[Quercus]]'') and sweet chestnut (''[[Castanea (plant)|Castanea]]''), with a preference for [[calcareous]] (chalky) soils. Other frequently reported hosts are  hornbeam (''[[Carpinus]]''), beech (''[[Fagus (plant)|Fagus]]'') and lime (''[[Tilia]]'').<ref name=\"Munoz 2005\"/><ref name=\"Galli 2007\"/>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], this striking bolete is found only in the south of England.<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book |vauthors=Nilson S, Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063005-8|page=104}}</ref> It is rare in [[Scandinavia]], occurring primarily on a few islands in the [[Baltic Sea]] where conditions are favourable, with highly calcareous soil.<ref name=Nilper/> In the eastern [[Mediterranean]] region, it has been reported from the Bar'am Forest in the [[Upper Galilee]] region of northern [[Israel]],<ref name=\"Avizohar 1972\"/> as well as the island of [[Cyprus]], where it is found in association with the narrow-endemic golden oak (''[[Quercus alnifolia]]'').<ref name=\"Loizides 2019\"/> It has further been documented in the [[Black Sea]] and eastern [[Anatolia]] regions of [[Turkey]],<ref name=Dem04/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sesli E |year=2007|title=Preliminary checklist of macromycetes of the East and Middle Black Sea Regions of Turkey |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=99|pages=71\u201374|url=http://www.mycotaxon.com/resources/checklists/sesli-v99-checklist.pdf}}</ref> with its distribution possibly extending as far south as [[Iran]].<ref name=Asef2010/>\n\nIn the past, ''R. satanas'' had been reported from the coastal areas of [[California]] and the southeastern US,<ref name=Amm85>{{cite book |title=Poisonous Mushrooms of the Northern United States and Canada; |vauthors=Ammirati JA, Traquair JA, Horgen PA |year=1985|publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=0-8166-1407-5|pages=241\u201342}}</ref> however, these sightings are instead of the closely related species ''[[Rubroboletus eastwoodiae]]''.\n\n== Toxicity ==\n[[File:Satansr\u00f6hrling-1.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration by artist Albin Schmalfu\u00df, 1897]]\nSatan's bolete is poisonous, especially if eaten raw.

Ramsbottom speculated that there may be a regional variation in its toxicity, and conceded that the fungus may not be as poisonous as widely reported.<ref name = \"Ramsbottom53\"/> Nevertheless, ''R. satanas'' is rarely sampled casually, not least because of the putrid smell of its mature fruiting bodies, which in addition to their bright colours and blue staining, make the fungus unappealing for human consumption.<ref name=Benj95/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Asef2010>{{cite book |script-title=fa:\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0686\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 |title=Qarch-ha-ye Sammi-ye Iran |trans-title=Poisonous mushrooms of Iran |year=2010 |author=Asef Shayan, M.R. |publisher=Iran shenasi |page=214 |isbn=978-964-2725-29-8 |language=Persian}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Avizohar 1972\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Avizohar-Hershenzon Z, Binyamini N |title=Boletaceae of Israel: I.

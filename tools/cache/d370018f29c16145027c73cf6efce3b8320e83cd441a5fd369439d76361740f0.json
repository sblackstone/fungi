Young specimens resemble a [[puffball]] when unopened. In maturity, the mushroom displays the characteristic [[Earthstar fungus|earthstar]] shape that is a result of the outer layer of [[fruit body]] tissue splitting open in a star-like manner. The false earthstar is an [[mycorrhizal|ectomycorrhizal]] species that grows in association with various trees, especially in sandy soils. ''A.&nbsp;hygrometricus'' was previously thought to have a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], though it is now thought to be restricted to Southern Europe, and ''Astraeus'' are common in temperate and tropical regions.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Phosri C, Mart\u00edn MP, Watling R | title = Astraeus: hidden dimensions | journal = IMA Fungus | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 347\u201356 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24563840 | pmc = 3905946 | doi = 10.5598/imafungus.2013.04.02.13 }}</ref> Its [[common name]]s refer to the fact that it is [[hygroscopic]] (water-absorbing), and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity, and close them up again in drier conditions. The rays have an irregularly cracked surface, while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top. The [[gleba]] is white initially, but turns brown and powdery when the [[spore]]s mature. The spores are reddish-brown, roughly spherical with minute warts, measuring 7.5\u201311 [[micrometer]]s in diameter.\n\nDespite a similar overall appearance, ''A.&nbsp;hygrometricus'' is not related to the true earthstars of genus ''[[Geastrum]]'', although historically, they have been [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] confused. The species was first described by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801 as ''Geastrum hygrometricus''. In 1885, [[Andrew P. Morgan]] proposed that differences in microscopic characteristics warranted the creation of a new genus ''[[Astraeus (genus)|Astraeus]]'' distinct from ''Geastrum''; this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities. Several Asian populations formerly thought to be ''A.&nbsp;hygrometricus'' were renamed in the 2000s once [[phylogenetic]] analyses revealed they were unique ''Astraeus'' species, including ''[[Astraeus asiaticus|A.&nbsp;asiaticus]]'' and ''[[Astraeus odoratus|A.&nbsp;odoratus]]''. Similarly, in 2013, North American populations were divided into ''[[Astraeus pteridis|A. pteridis]]'', [[Astraeus morganii|''A. morganii'']], and [[Astraeus smithii|''A. smithii'']] on the basis of molecular phylogentics. This research suggests that the type specimen of ''Astraeus hygrometricus'' originates in a population restricted to Europe between Southern France and Turkey, with [[Astraeus telleriae|A. telleriae]] found nearby in Spain and Greece.<ref name=\":0\" /> Research has revealed the presence of several [[biological activity|bioactive]] chemical compounds in ''Astraeus'' fruit bodies. North American field guides typically rate ''A.&nbsp;hygrometricus'' as inedible.\n\n==Taxonomy, naming, and phylogeny==\n\nBecause this species resembles the earthstar fungi of ''Geastrum'', it was placed in that genus by early authors, starting with [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801<ref name=Persoon1801/> (as ''Geaster'', an alternate spelling of ''Geastrum''). According to the American botanist [[Andrew P. Morgan]], however, the species differed from those of ''Geastrum'' in not having open chambers in the young [[gleba]], having larger and branched capillitium threads, not having a true [[hymenium]], and having larger spores. Accordingly, Morgan set Persoon's ''Geaster hygrometricum'' as the [[type species]] of his new genus ''Astraeus'' in 1889.<ref name=Morgan1889/> Despite Morgan's publication, some authorities in the following decades continued to classify the species in ''Geastrum''.<ref name=Coker1928/><ref name=Lloyd1902/> The New-Zealand based mycologist [[Gordon Herriot Cunningham]] explicitly transferred the species back to the genus ''Geastrum'' in 1944, explaining: <blockquote>The treatment of this species by certain taxonomists well illustrates the pitfalls that lie in wait for those who worship at the shrine of ontogenic classification ... The only feature of those outlined in which the species differs from others of ''Geastrum'' is the somewhat primitive hymenium. In the developing plant the glebal cavities are separated by tramal plates so tenuous as to be overlooked by the uncritical worker. Each cavity is filled with basidia somewhat irregularly arranged in clusters (like those of ''[[Scleroderma]]'') and not in the definite palisade of the species which have been studied. This difference disappears as maturity is reached, when plants resemble closely the fructification of any other member of the genus. The taxonomist is then unable to indicate any point of difference by which \"''Astraeus''\" may be separated from ''Geastrum'', which indicates that the name should be discarded.<ref name=Cunningham1944/></blockquote> Cunningham's treatment was not followed by later authorities, who largely considered ''Astraeus'' a distinct genus. According to the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] authority [[MycoBank]],<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Astraeus hygrometricus\"/> [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]] of ''Astraeus hygrometricus'' include ''Lycoperdon stellatus'' Scop. (1772);<ref name=Scopoli1772/> ''Geastrum fibrillosum'' Schwein. (1822);<ref name=Schweinitz1822/> ''Geastrum stellatum'' (Scop.) Wettst. (1885); and ''Astraeus stellatus'' E.Fisch. (1900).<ref name=Engler1900/>\n\n''Astraeus hygrometricus'' has been given a number of [[common name|colloquial names]] that allude to its hygroscopic behavior, including the \"hygrometer earthstar\", the \"hygroscopic earthstar\", the \"barometer earthstar\", and the \"water-measure earthstar\".<ref name=Roody2003/><ref name=McKnight1987/> The resemblance to ''Geastrum'' species (also known as true earthstars) accounts for the common name \"false earthstar\".<ref name=Alexopoulos1996/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words \u1f51\u03b3\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (''hygros'') \"wet\" and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (''metron'') \"measure\".<ref name=Rea1922/> The [[German Mycological Society]] selected the species as their \"Mushroom of the Year\" in 2005.<ref name=DGfM/>\n\nStudies in the 2000s showed that several species from Asian collection sites labelled under the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''hygrometricus'' were actually considerably variable in a number of [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] and [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] characteristics.<ref name=Phosri2004/> [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] studies of the [[DNA sequence]]s of the [[internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] region of the [[ribosomal DNA]] from a number of ''Astraeus'' specimens from around the world have helped to clarify [[phylogenetic]] relationships within the genus. Based on these results, two Asian \"''hygrometricus''\" populations have been described as new species: ''[[Astraeus asiaticus|A.&nbsp;asiaticus]]''<ref name=Phosri2004/> and ''[[Astraeus odoratus|A.&nbsp;odoratus]]'' (synonymous with Petcharat's ''A.&nbsp;thailandicus'' described in 2003<ref name=Petcharat2003/>). Preliminary DNA analyses suggests that the European ''A.&nbsp;hygrometricus'' described by Persoon is a different species than the North American version described by Morgan, and that the European population may be divided into two distinct [[phylotype]]s, from France (''A. hygrometricus'') and from the Mediterranean (''[[Astraeus telleriae|A. telleriae]]'').<ref name=Phosri2007/><ref name=Fangfuk2010/> A follow-up analysis from 2013 named two new North American species: ''[[Astraeus morganii|A. morganii]]'' from the Southern US and Mexico and ''[[Astraeus smithii|A. smithii]]'' from the Central and Northern United States, and grouped western US specimens in ''[[Astraeus pteridis|A. pteridis]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> A 2010 study identified a Japanese species, previously identified as ''A.&nbsp;hygrometricus'', as genetically distinct; it has yet to be officially named.<ref name=Fangfuk2010/>\n\nA form of the species found in Korea and Japan, ''A.&nbsp;hygrometricus'' var. ''koreanus'', was named by V.J. Stan\u0115k in 1958;<ref name=Stanek1958/> it was later (1976) published as a distinct species\u2014''A.&nbsp;koreanus''\u2014by [[Hanns Kreisel]].<ref name=Kreisel1976/> As pointed out by Fangfuk and colleagues, clarification of the proper name for this taxon must await analysis of ''A.&nbsp;hygrometricus'' var. ''koreanus'' specimens from the [[type locality (biology)|type locality]] in North Korea.<ref name=Fangfuk2010/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Astraeus hygrometricus 113828.jpg|left|thumb|A collection of fruit bodies]]\nYoung specimens of ''A.&nbsp;hygrometricus'' have roughly spherical [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruit bodies]] that typically start their development partially embedded in the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. A smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body, and may be partially encrusted with debris. As the fruit body matures, the mycelial layer tears away, and the outer tissue layer, the [[peridium|exoperidium]], breaks open in a star-shaped ([[wikt:stellate|stellate]]) pattern to form 4\u201320 irregular \"rays\". This simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium. The rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment, opening up in high humidity, and closing when the air is dry.<ref name=Schaechter1998/> This is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue; the innermost, fibrous layer is [[hygroscopic]], and curls or uncurls the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings.<ref name=Gaumann1928/> This adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of optimum moisture, and reduce evaporation during dry periods.<ref name=Foy1991/><ref name=\"urlFotM\"/> Further, dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind, allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll.<ref name=Schaechter1998/>\n{{Quote box |width = 33% |quote= \"This veritable barometer is the most theatrical of all the earthstars.

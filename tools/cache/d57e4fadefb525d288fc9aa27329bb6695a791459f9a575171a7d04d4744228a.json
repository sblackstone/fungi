To date, it has not been determined whether antibiotic medicine for humans and other animals can be developed from this protein.\n\n===Culturing===\n''Coprinopsis cinerea'' can be grown on complex (e.g. YMG, YMG/T) or minimal media (e.g. mKjalke medium), solid or liquid, with or without agitation, at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or optimally at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C. It can be grown in dark or with 12-h light/12-h dark cycle.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Efficient gene targeting in \u0394Cc.ku70 or \u0394Cc.lig4 mutants of the agaricomycete Coprinopsis cinerea.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Lcc1 and Lcc5 are the main laccases secreted in liquid cultures of Coprinopsis cinerea strains</ref>\n\n===Strains===\n*C. cinereus strain PG78 (A6B42, trp1.1;1.6, pab1) is an AmutBmut monokaryon, self-compatible strain, with trp- and pab-auxotrophic markers (requires tryptophan and p-aminobenzoate).<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Restriction enzyme-mediated DNA integration in Coprinus cinereus</ref>\n\n===Genome===\n''Coprinopsis cinerea'' strain Okayama 7 (#130) was sequenced with 10x coverage in 2003. A third and most recent revision of the sequence of strain Okayama 7 (#130) was released in 2010. Its haploid genome is ca. 37.5 Mb.<ref>http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/coprinus_cinereus/MultiHome.html</ref>\n\n===Molecular cloning===\n''Coprinopsis cinerea'' can be transformed with exogenous DNA by transformation when the fungus is a protoplast. It was found that disrupting (knockout or RNAi silencing) ''[[ku70]]'' homologue can increase gene targeting via increased homologous recombination. Either protoplasts derived from oidia or vegetative mycelium can be used, however, gene targeting was found to be higher by 2% (based on phenotyping) when using vegetative mycelium.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Otherwise, insertion of integrative vectors ectopically and with small homologous regions can be used, likely with low transformation efficiency. \nEarlier, REMI (restriction enzyme-mediated integration) could be used to insert exogenous DNA into the chromosome to produce mutant strains. This relies on inserting exogenous DNA and restriction enzymes into the protoplast cell, allowing for the enzymes to cut the chromosome at specific sites which match those sites used to produce linearized plasmid DNA with the gene of interest; subsequently, host enzymes ligate the cut sites and thus produce integrated heterologous, exogenous DNA. Although successful, undesirable mutations are likely.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Chemical mutagenesis (also random) can also be done. Phenotype selection of the inability to fruit can indict that insertion led to disruption of vital genes. All in all, homologous recombination provides more specificity when creating a mutant strain. Depending on the mutant, auxotrophy markers (requires lost gene to be inserted) or prototrophy (when causing essential gene deletion) be used for selection.\n\n===Enzymes===\n''Coprinopsis cinerea'' is known to produce [[laccase]], a type of phenoloxidase. ''C. cinerea'' produces a variety of the same laccase, known as isoenzymes. Laccase activity can be measured by [[zymogram]]s (in which a substrate for the enzyme is present in a separating gel). Under stressed conditions, temperature and medium, laccase secretion was increased. Although copper is required co-factor for laccase, merely adding copper did not induce laccase secretion.<ref>Lcc1 and Lcc5 are the main laccases secreted in liquid\ncultures of Coprinopsis cinerea strains</ref> It was recently found that a [[TET]] (Ten-Eleven translocation dioxygenases) homologue, ''CcTET'', was identified in ''C. cinerea'', which may have important human (or mammalian) implications like cancer. DNA methylation is vital in humans and dysfunction is associated with cancer, thus, studying methylation reactions in non-mammalians may provide better insight into mammalian methylation reactions.<ref>A TET Homologue Protein from Coprinopsis cinerea (CcTET) That\nBiochemically Converts 5\u2011Methylcytosine to\n5\u2011Hydroxymethylcytosine, 5\u2011Formylcytosine, and 5\u2011Carboxylcytosine</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\n''Coprinopsis cinerea'' can sense blue light.

During meiosis homologous chromosomes pair with each other and undergo a DNA repair process in which DNA damage is removed and genetic information is recombined.<ref>Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013). Evolutionary Origin and Adaptive Function of Meiosis. In Meiosis: Bernstein C and Bernstein H, editors. {{ISBN|978-953-51-1197-9}}, InTech, http://www.intechopen.com/books/meiosis/evolutionary-origin-and-adaptive-function-of-meiosis</ref>  Burns et al.<ref name=\"pmid20885784\" /> studied the expression of genes involved in the 15-hour meiotic process encompassing time points prior to the haploid nuclear fusion that forms the diploid zygote to the final formation of the four haploid products.  They compared expression of particular genes in ''C. cinerea'' to the expression of the comparable genes (orthologs) in two other species (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'') from which ''C. cinerea'' had diverged in evolution 500 to 900 million years ago.  They found that the expression of individual genes turned on or off at the same stage in ''C. cinerea'' as in the other two species.  They also found that genes considered to be specifically involved in the meiotic process were more conserved in their expression pattern than non-meiotic genes.  These findings indicate ancient conservation of the meiotic process.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Coprinopsis species|List of ''Coprinopsis'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=McKnight1987>{{cite book |vauthors=McKnight VB, McKnight KH |title=A Field Guide to Mushrooms: North America |series=Peterson Field Guides |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Massachusetts |year=1987 |page=277 |isbn=978-0-395-91090-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSdA3V7Z9WcC&lpg=PA277}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Coprinopsis cinerea\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=474379 |title=''Coprinopsis cinerea'' (Schaeff.)

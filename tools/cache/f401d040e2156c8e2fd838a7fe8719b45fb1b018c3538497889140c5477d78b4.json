It was first described by [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of [[latex|milk]]. It has been the subject of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so named because of their association with ''Lactarius''. The edibility of ''L.&nbsp;blennius'' is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is [[edible mushroom|edible]] (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n''Lactarius blennius'' was first described by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as ''Agaricus blennius'' in 1815, before being given its current binomial name by the same author in 1838.<ref name=nilper/> Within the genus ''[[Lactarius]]'', it is closely related to ''Lactarius cinereus'', another ''Lactarius'' species that also favours [[beech]].<ref name=\"Bills\"/> It has been suggested that the two species (forming a group) could have a [[coevolution]]ary pathway with beech.<ref name=\"Bills\"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from a [[Latin]] adjective ''blennius'', meaning \"slimy\".<ref name=nilper>{{cite book | last = Nilson|first= Sven |author2=Olle Persson  | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page= 100}}</ref> ''Lactarius'' mushrooms are [[common name|commonly]] known as milkcaps,<ref name=\"Sterry\">{{cite book |title= Complete Guide to British Mushrooms & Toadstools|author1=Sterry, Paul |author2=Hughes, Barry |year= 2009|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|isbn= 978-0-00-723224-6|page= 52}}</ref> and ''L. blennius'' is known as the Slimy Milkcap<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> or the Beech Milkcap.<ref name=\"Sterry\"/>\n\n''Lactarius blennius'' is [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''Agaricus blennius'' (the name under which Fries first described the species in 1815) and ''Agaricus viridis'', a name given earlier by [[Heinrich Schrader (botanist)|Heinrich Schrader]], in 1794.

However, this genus is often treated as a [[subgenus]] of ''Cortinarius'' only.\n\nIn 2007, Bruno Gasparini suggested that ''C.&nbsp;austrovenetus'' is the same species as another ''Cortinarius'' in subgenus ''Dermocybe'', ''[[Cortinarius walkerae|C.&nbsp;walkerae]]''. If this is true, ''C.&nbsp;austrovenetus'' is a later [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] and the name C.&nbsp;walkerae would take precedence.<ref name=\"Gasparini 2007\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''Cortinarius austrovenetus'' are smooth with a convex or flat [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that can be up to {{convert|16|cm|in|0}} across. The [[biological pigment|pigment]] has been isolated and described as austrovenetin.<ref>Gill M, Gimenez A (1991) Austrovenetin, the principal pigment of the toadstool ''Dermocybe austroveneta''. ''Phytochemistry'' '''30''' 951\u2013955</ref> They have yellowy brown; adnate [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] underneath the cap.\n\nLike most members of the family Cortinariaceae this mushroom has a thin web-like [[partial veil|veil]] (the cortina) protecting the gills in the early stages of growth. Remnants of this veil may be seen (often quite fleetingly) on the mature [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]].\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nOccurring particularly in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]] and typically in [[eucalypt]] forests or woodlands. It may exist in some numbers in [[New South Wales]], [[South Australia]] and other eastern Australian states but little research has been conducted.<ref name=deh/>\n\n==Edibility==\nThe [[edible mushrooms|edibility]] of this mushroom is unknown, and it should be avoided, as some of its close relatives contain lethal toxins.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Gasparini 2007\">{{cite journal |author=Gasparini B. |title=Is ''Cortinarius austrovenetus'' a synonym of ''C. walkerae''? |journal=Mycotaxon |year=2007 |volume=102 |pages=241\u2013245 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0102/0241.htm}}</ref>\n\n}}\n*[http://www.anbg.gov.au/fungi/images-captions/dermocybe-austroveneta-0304.html Dermocybe austroveneta]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2998123}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1928]]\n[[Category:Fungi native to Australia]]\n[[Category:Cortinarius|austrovenetus]]"}]}}}}

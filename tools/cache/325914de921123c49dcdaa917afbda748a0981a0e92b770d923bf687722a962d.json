It is a fairly common fungus, both in North America and Europe, found growing among short green [[grass]]. Until recently, the species was also commonly called '''''Conocybe lactea''''' or '''''Conocybe albipes''''' and is [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] known as the '''white dunce cap''' .<ref>[http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=438179 Index Fungorum - Names Record<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Another common synonym, ''Bolbitius albipes'' G.H. Otth 1871, places the fungus in the genus ''[[Bolbitius]]''.\n\n==Description==\nEasily missed due to their very small size, ''C. apala'' fruit bodies are otherwise quite easy to identify. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] has a pale cream to silvery-white colour and may sometimes have a darker yellow to brown coloration towards the central [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. Its trademark hood-shaped conical cap expands with age and may flatten out, the surface being marked by minute radiating ridges. The cap can be up to 3&nbsp;cm in diameter. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] may be visible through the thin cap and these are coloured rust or cinnamon brown and quite dense. They are adnexed or free and release brown to reddish-brown elliptical spores producing a [[spore print]] of the same colour. The stem is cap-coloured, elongated, thin, hollow and more or less equal along its length with a height up to 11&nbsp;cm and diameter 0.1 to 0.3&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"mushex\">{{cite web | title=''Conocybe albipes'' at Mushroom Expert | publisher=Mushroom Expert | url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/conocybe_lactea.html | accessdate=July 16, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"jordan\">{{cite book | author = M.

The flesh of ''C. apala'' has no discernible taste or smell and is extremely fragile to the touch.\n\n==Habitat==\n''C. apala'' is a [[saprobe]] found in areas with rich soil and short grass such as [[pasture]]s, playing fields, [[lawn]]s, [[meadow]]s as well as rotting [[manure]]d [[straw]], fruiting single or sparingly few [[ephemeral]] bodies. It is commonly found fruiting during humid, rainy weather with generally overcast skies. It will appear on sunny mornings while there is [[dew]] but will not persist once it evaporates. In most cases, by midday the delicate fruiting bodies [[shrivel]], dry and fade from sight. ''C.apala'''s fruiting season begins in spring and ends in autumn.<ref name = \"mushex\"/> It is distributed across [[Europe]] and [[North America]].<ref name=rogers>{{cite web | title=''Conocybe lactea'' at Rogers Mushrooms | publisher=Rogers Mushrooms | url=http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5839.asp | accessdate=July 16, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118013716/http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5839.asp | archive-date=November 18, 2008 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nWhile it has not caused deaths, it is toxic, containing [[phallotoxins]] <ref name=\"HallenWatling2003\">{{cite journal|last1=Hallen|first1=Heather E.|last2=Watling|first2=Roy|last3=Adams|first3=Gerard C.|title=Taxonomy and toxicity of Conocybe lactea and related species|journal=Mycological Research|volume=107|issue=8|year=2003|pages=969\u2013979|issn=09537562|doi=10.1017/S0953756203008190}}</ref>\n\n==External links and resources==\n* [http://www.mushroomexpert.com/conocybe_lactea.html Mushroom Expert - Conocybe albipes]\n* [http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Conocybe_lactea.html MykoWeb California Fungi - Conocybe lactea]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons|Conocybe apala}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1632206}}\n\n[[Category:Bolbitiaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Poisonous fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 2003]]"}]}}}}

It has a northerly distribution, and is found in [[temperate]] regions of North America and Europe, associated with [[spruce]] trees. Distinguishing features of its [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] include the large orange-yellow [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, cream to pale yellow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], and a yellow coarsely-pitted [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] that is up to {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Cut fruit bodies ooze a white [[latex]] that will stain mushroom tissue [[lilac (color)|lilac]] to purple. Several chemicals have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies that can modify the growth of plants, and the mushroom also has [[antibiotic]] activity against ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. ''L.&nbsp;repraesentaneus'' is [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]],{{Citation needed|reason=the opposite is claimed in the literature, see Talk page|date=December 2017}} and consumption causes stomach aches.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Lactarius repraesentaneus'' was first described by German mycologist [[Max Britzelmayr]] in 1885, based on material collected from [[Bavaria]].<ref name=Britzelmayr1885/> The [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''Lactarius scrobiculatus'' var. ''repraesentaneus'', proposed by  Killermann in 1933,<ref name=Killermann1933/> is considered a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]].<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Lactarius scrobiculatus var. repraesentaneus\"/> [[Rolf Singer]] in 1942 defined the [[subspecies]] ''L.&nbsp;repraesentaneus'' ssp. ''speciosus'' to include fruit bodies with matted fibers (\"felt\") arranged in concentric rings on the cap ([[wikt:zonate|zonate]]), in comparison with the [[nominate subspecies]], where in young specimens the felt was evenly distributed on the cap surface, only becoming zonate at the cap margins in maturity.<ref name=Singer1942/>\n\nAccording to the [[classification (biology)|classification]] proposed by [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]] in their 1979 [[monograph]] of North American ''Lactarius'' species, ''L.&nbsp;repraesentaneus'' belongs in the [[wikt:stirp|stirps]] ''Speciosus'' of the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Aspideini'', of the [[subgenus]] ''Piperites'' of genus ''[[Lactarius]]''. Other species in stirps ''Speciosus'' include ''[[Lactarius dispersus|L.&nbsp;dispersus]]'', ''[[Lactarius subtorminosus|L.&nbsp;subtorminosus]]'', and ''[[Lactarius speciosus|L.&nbsp;speciosus]]'', all of which have a hairy  cap edge.<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1979, p. 225.</ref> Singer's 1986 classification of the Agaricales does not divide subsection ''Aspideini'' into stirpes, instead grouping ''Lactarius repraesentaneus'' with ''[[Lactarius aspideus|L.&nbsp;aspideus]]'', ''[[Lactarius uvidus|L.&nbsp;uvidus]]'', ''[[Lactarius luridis|L.&nbsp;luridis]]'', ''[[Lactarius psammicola|L.&nbsp;psammicola]]'', and ''L.&nbsp;speciosus''.<ref name=Singer1986/>\n\nThe mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"northern bearded milkcap\", the \"northern milkcap\", or the \"purple-staining milkcap\".<ref name=Bessette2009/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''repraesentaneus'' is [[Latin]] for \"well-represented\".<ref name=Evenson1997/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lactarius repraesentaneus 72459.jpg|thumb|180px|left|The gills, normally a cream to dull yellow color, will stain purple when bruised.]]\n[[File:Lactarius representaneus 41559 edit.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Young specimens are conspicuously bearded on the cap margin.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''L.&nbsp;repraesentaneus'' is {{convert|6|\u2013|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, convex to broadly funnel-shaped. The margin (the edge of the cap) is conspicuously bearded on young specimens. The cap surface is faintly zoned to azonate, with a thin layer of matted fibers, often becoming [[wikt:scurf|scurfy]] with age. It is dry to somewhat sticky, light yellow to orange-yellow, sometimes with rusty tints when older. The attachment of the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] to the stem is slightly decurrent\u2014running slightly down the length of the stem. The gills are moderately broad, close to crowded, sometimes forked near the stem. Normally a cream to pale [[ochre|ochraceous]] color, they will stain dull lilac to purple when bruised.<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|5|\u2013|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, nearly equal in width throughout or enlarged downward, hollow at maturity, sticky to dry, scrobiculate (coarsely pitted), pale yellow to orange-yellow, and stains dull lilac to purple. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm, brittle, white, and will stain dull lilac to purple when cut. The odor is sometimes faintly fragrant or not distinctive, but when the mushroom is dry it smells intensely of soap.<ref name=Pilat1961/> Its taste is mild to slightly [[wikt:acrid|acrid]] or somewhat bitter, and the flavor has been compared to sweet flag (''[[Acorus calamus]]'').<ref name=Pilat1961/> The abundant amount of [[latex]] produced by the mushroom is white to cream, unchanging, staining all tissues dull lilac to purple. It tastes mild to slightly acrid or somewhat bitter. The [[spore print]] is yellowish.<ref name=Bessette2009/> The fruit bodies are [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] and consumption will cause stomach aches, but the nature of the toxic agents has not been identified.<ref name=Paloucek2007/>\n\nA new [[form (botany)|form]], ''Lactarius repraesentaneus'' f. ''immutabilis'', was described from [[Le Sappey]], in the [[Haute-Savoie]] [[Departments of France|department]] of southeastern France in 2011. It differs in the staining reaction of its injured flesh.<ref name=\"Filion 2011\"/>\n\nThe [[spore]]s are 8\u201312 by 6.5\u20139&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]], broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, ornamented with warts and ridges that do not form a [[wikt:reticulum|reticulum]], prominences up to 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5m high, [[hyaline]], and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is an ixocutis\u2014with the [[hypha]]e embedded in a slimy or gelatinized layer.<ref name=Bessette2009/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Lactarius scrobiculatus.JPG|thumb|right|''Lactarius scrobiculatus'']]\n''Lactarius repraesentaneus'' is similar in appearance to ''[[Lactarius scrobiculatus]]'', which has latex that turns yellow when exposed to air, a different smell, a stinging flesh and a different reaction of the milk to alkali: in ''L.&nbsp;scrobiculatus'' the milk turns reddish-orange while that of ''L.&nbsp;representaneus'' does not change color. ''[[Lactarius uvidus]]'' also has a violet reaction but it has a different color and is not hairy at the margin of the cap. ''[[Lactarius flavidus|L.&nbsp;flavidus]]'' has a yellowish cap but does not have a hairy margin.\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nLike other ''Lactarius'' species, ''L.&nbsp;repraesentaneus'' is thought to form [[mycorrhiza]]l relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, forming a sheath of tissue. This enables the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affords the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;repraesentaneus'' are found scattered or in groups on the ground under [[spruce]] from August to September. The fungus is distributed in higher elevations in the northern USA and southern Canada where spruce is present. It has also been reported from [[Alaska]], [[California]], and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The frequency of its appearance is described as occasional to fairly common.<ref name=Bessette2009/> In Europe, where it is fairly rare, it is found mainly underneath sallows (''[[Salix capraea]]'') in forests at the foot of mountains on non-[[calcareous]] soil. It has been collected in Czechoslovakia,<ref name=Pilat1961/> Sweden,<ref name=Andersson1957/> Switzerland, the [[French Alps]] and England; overall, it is widely distributed throughout the [[temperate]] zone of the northern hemisphere.<ref name=Pilat1961/> The fungus has also been collected under birch (''[[Betula pubescens|B.&nbsp;pubescens]]'', ''[[Betula nana|B.&nbsp;nana]]'', and ''[[Betula glandulosa|B.&nbsp;glandulosa]]'') in [[Greenland]].<ref name=Elborne1990/>\n\n==Bioactive compounds==\n''Lactarius repraesentaneus'' was reported to have [[antibiotic]] activity against ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in 1947. The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be heat-sensitive, was not identified.<ref name=Wiken1947/> A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from ''L.&nbsp;repraesentaneus'' that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called [[sesquiterpenoid]]s are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the [[radicle]] elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively.<ref name=Hirota2003/> Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F. Repraesentin E showed the strongest growth promotion activity, 164% at 3.6&nbsp;\u00b5m, of the three compounds toward the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings.<ref name=Kashiwabara2006/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=Andersson1957>{{cite journal |author=Andersson SO. |year=1957\u201358 |title=Svampfynd fr\u00e5n sydv\u00e4stra Sverige |trans-title=Some Hymenomycetes from south-western Sweden |journal=Friesia |volume=6 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=40\u201346 |url=http://www.svampe.dk/friesia/volumes/Friesia-VI-1-2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette AR, Bessette A, Harris DM |title=Milk Mushrooms of North America: A Field Guide to the Genus ''Lactarius'' |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse |year=2009 |pages=231\u201332 |isbn=0-8156-3229-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Britzelmayr1885>{{cite journal |author=Britzelmayr M. |year=1885 |title=Hymenomyceten aus S\u00fcdbayern 4: Cortinarii |trans-title=Hymenomycetes of South Bavaria 4: Cortinarii |journal=Berichte des Naturhistorischen Vereins Augsburg |volume=28 |pages=119\u2013160 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Elborne1990>{{cite book |title=The Greenland Mountain Birch Zone, Southwest Greenland |chapter=Larger fungi associated with ''Betula pubescens'' in Greenland |vauthors=Elborne SA, Knudsen H |veditors=Fredskild B, \u00d8dum S |year=1990 |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |series=Bioscience |volume=33 |isbn=978-87-635-1204-6 |pages=77\u201380 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czvAEzkIiqEC&lpg=PA80&dq=Lactarius%20repraesentaneus&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q=Lactarius%20repraesentaneus&f=false |accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Evenson1997>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms of Colorado and the Southern Rocky Mountains |last=Evenson VS. |year=1997 |publisher=Westcliffe Publishers |location= |isbn=978-1-56579-192-3 |page=80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAeDeyqZLq0C&lpg=PR10&dq=Lactarius%20repraesentaneus&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q=Lactarius%20repraesentaneus&f=false |accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Filion 2011\">{{cite journal |author=Fillion R. |title=Une nouvelle forme de ''Lactarius repraesentaneus'' decouverte sur la montagne du Saleve (Haute-Savoie) |trans-title=A new form of  Lactarius repraesentaneus discovered in Mount Saleve (Haute-Savoie) |journal=Bulletin Mycologique et Botanique Dauphine-Savoie |year=2011 |volume=51 |issue=200/201 |pages=35\u20139 |language=French |issn=1771-754X}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hirota2003>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirota M, Shimizu Y, Kamo T, Makabe H, Shibata H |year=2003 |title=New plant growth promoters, repraesentins A, B and C, from ''Lactarius repraesentaneus'' |journal=Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry |volume=67 |issue=7 |pages=1597\u20131600 |pmid=12913310 |doi=10.1271/bbb.67.1597}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kashiwabara2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kashiwabara M, Kamo T, Makabe H, Shibata H, Hirota M |year=2006 |title=Repraesentins D, E and F, new plant growth promoters from ''Lactarius repraesentaneus'' |journal=Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=1502\u20135 |pmid=16794335 |doi=10.1271/bbb.50639}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Killermann1933>{{cite journal |author=Killermann S. |year=1933 |title=Pilze aus Bayern. 5.

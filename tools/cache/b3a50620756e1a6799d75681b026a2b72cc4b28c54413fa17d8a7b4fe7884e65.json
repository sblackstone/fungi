Despite being edible, it is not recommended by some because of its poor taste, though can be used as seasoning when dried. The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. It bleeds a whitish peppery-tasting [[latex|milk]] when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, ''Lactifluus piperatus'' has been accidentally introduced to Australia. [[Mycorrhizal]], it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including [[beech]], and [[hazel]], and fruiting bodies are found on the forest floor in [[deciduous]] woodland.\n\n==Systematics and taxonomy==\nThe species was one of the many species named by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] who officially described it in Volume Two of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753 as ''Agaricus piperatus'',<ref name=Linnaeus1753/> the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] deriving from the [[Latin]] adjective ''piperatus'' meaning \"peppery\".<ref name=Simpson1979/> For many years, [[county of Tyrol|Tyrolian]] naturalist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] had been considered the author of the first description; however, a recent revision of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] in 1987 changed the rules regarding the starting date and primary work for names of fungi. Previously, the starting date had been set as January 1, 1821, the date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]], but now names can be considered valid as far back as May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' seminal work.<ref name=Esser1994/>\n\n''Lactifluus piperatus'' was the original [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Lactarius]]''. However, after the finding that ''Lactarius'' actually represented more than one genus,<ref name=Buyck2008/> the species ''[[Lactarius torminosus]]'' was conserved as type for that genus.<ref name=Buyck2010/><ref name=\"Norvell2011\"/><ref name=\"Barrie2011\"/> Thus, ''L. piperatus'' is now the type species of ''Lactifluus'', which was split from ''Lactarius'' and contains mainly tropical milk-caps, but also some species of the north temperate zone.<ref name=\"verbeken2013\"/> [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] research showed that ''[[Lactifluus glaucescens|L. glaucescens]]'', sometimes considered only a variety of ''L. piperatus'', is a distinct species in Europe.<ref name=DeCrop2014/> Furthermore, the existence of at least ten lineages worldwide, with no overlap among continents, was shown for the group around ''L. piperatus'', suggesting that populations in North America might actually be distinct species.<ref name=DeCrop2014/>\n\nIt is commonly known as the peppery milk cap,<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/> pepper milkcap,<ref name=Peterson1998/> peppery Lactarius,<ref name=\"Marshall2003\"/> peppery milk mushroom,<ref name=\"Russell2006\"/> white peppery milk-cap, or other similar names. Similarly, in German it is known as the ''Pfeffermilchling'' (\"pepper milk cap\").<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lactarius-vellereus-11-X-2007-066.jpg|thumb|left|The similar ''[[Lactifluus vellereus|L. vellereus]]'' is differentiated by its shorter, thicker stipe and its large, woolly cap.]]\n''Lactifluus piperatus'' has a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that varies from {{convert|6|-|16|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} across and is convex with a widely funnel-shaped center. The cap is creamy-white in colour, [[Glabrousness|glabrous]] and not glossy; its surface may become cracked in dry locales.<ref name=Haas1969/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white in colour, smooth,<ref name=\"Pegler1983\"/> {{convert|3|-|7|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} thick and is cylindrical, sometimes tapering towards the base.<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/> There is a thick layer of firm white flesh, and the [[decurrent]] [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are particularly crowded and narrow, sharing the white colouration of the stem but becoming creamy with age.<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/><ref name=\"Pegler1983\"/> As with other species of ''Lactarius'',<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/> there is abundant milk ([[latex]]), which is white,<ref name=\"Pegler1983\"/> and dries olive-green.<ref name=Laessoe1998/> It has a white [[spore print]] with [[wikt:elongate|elongate]], [[elliptic]] or [[amyloid]] [[spores]] which are ornamented, as with ''[[Lactifluus vellereus|L. vellereus]]''. The spores measure from 6.5&ndash;9.5 by 5&ndash;8&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]], and have tiny warts.<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/><ref name=\"Pegler1983\"/>\n\n''[[Lactifluus vellereus|L. vellereus]]'' is larger with a thick stipe, woolly cap and less crowded gills,<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> but is not as tall.<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/> ''[[Russula delica]]'' is similar in colour and shape, though has [[adnate gills|adnate]] blue-green tinged gills and no milk.<ref name=Haas1969/> ''[[Lactifluus deceptivus|L. deceptivus]]'' is also similar, but is differentiated by its less crowded gills, firmer cap margin and less acrid milk.<ref name=Roody2003/> Close to ''L. piperatus'' is ''[[Lactifluus glaucescens|L. glaucescens]]'', which is differentiated by its milk that dries with a greenish colour.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Lactifluus piperatus'' in the wide sense, i.e. including probably several species,<ref name=DeCrop2014/> is found in [[Europe]],<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/> the [[Black sea]] region in northeastern [[Turkey]],<ref name=Sesli2007/> and eastern and central [[North America]] east of [[Minnesota]].<ref name=Arora1986/> It has been accidentally introduced into [[Australasia]], where it is found under introduced and native trees.<ref name=\"Hall2003\"/><ref name=Fuhrer2005/> It is found on the floor in [[deciduous]] [[woodland]], particularly under [[beech]] (''Betula''), and can be found throughout summer and autumn and into early winter.<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/><ref name=Haas1969/> It is relatively common, though not as common as the similar species ''L. vellereus''.<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/> ''L. piperatus'' is found solitarily or in scattered groups.<ref name=\"Jordan2004\"/> It is sometimes found growing together with ''[[Russula cyanoxantha]]''.<ref name=Haas1969/>\n\n==Edibility==\nDespite being described by some [[mycology|mycologists]] as inedible<ref name=\"Jordan2004\"/> or even [[poison]]ous,<ref name=\"Hall2003\"/> ''Lactifluus piperatus'' is generally considered edible.<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/><ref name=\"Marshall2003\"/><ref name=\"Pegler1983\"/> However, it is not recommended by some, because of its unpleasant taste.<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/> It is difficult to digest when eaten raw, but is used as a seasoning when dried, or sometimes is eaten fresh after [[parboiling]], though its taste is still unappetising.<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/> Some recommend [[frying]] in butter with bacon and onion<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> or [[pickling]],<ref name=\"Russell2006\"/> or baking in a pie or pastry as other ways to prepare it.<ref name=Haas1969/> The milk has a very hot and acrid taste,<ref name=\"Phillips1981\"/> which is removed if boiled.<ref name=\"Pegler1983\"/> The mushroom used to be highly regarded in [[Russia]],<ref name=Molokhovets1992/> where it would be picked in dry seasons when other edible species were less available.<ref name=\"Pegler1983\"/> The mushroom is also popular in [[Finland]], where cooks boil it repeatedly, disposing of the water each time, and then store it in salt water and keep it refrigerated, after which it is pickled or served in salads.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> When eaten fresh and raw, the mushroom has been known to cause an [[Irritation|irritant reaction]] on the lips and tongue, which subsides after an hour.<ref name=\"Spoerke1994\"/> The close ''L. glaucescens'' has been reported to be poisonous,<ref name=Metzler1992/> but it has been speculated that the \"poisonings\" were caused by the extremely strong, peppery taste, rather than by the presence of actual poisons.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/>\n\n''Lactifluus piperatus'' forms part of an unusual and highly regarded dish in North America, being one of several species parasitized by the lobster mushroom ''[[Hypomyces lactifluorum]]''. Once colonized by the parasite, an orange-red crust forms over the surface of the mushroom, and the taste becomes delicious as the parasite infiltrates its host's tissues.<ref name=Arora1986/> It is also a common source of food among [[red squirrel]]s.<ref name=Camazine1984/>\n\n==Other uses==\nBecause of the presence of [[auxin]]s in ''Lactifluus piperatus'' [[metabolite]]s, it can be applied as a [[Cutting (plant)|rooting hormone]] to aid the growth of seedlings of various species of plants, including [[hazel]], [[beech]] and [[oak]].<ref name=Mohan1999/> In the 19th century, it was used as a [[folk medicine|folk cure]] for [[tuberculosis]], though it had no effect.<ref name=Rolfe1974/> In more recent times, it has been found that ''L. piperatus'' can be used as an [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] agent, and the latex has been used against [[virus|viral]] [[wart]]s.<ref name=Hoffman1999/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactifluus species|List of ''Lactifluus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |pages=71 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Barrie2011\">{{Cite journal |author=Barrie F. |title=Report of the General Committee: 11 |journal=Taxon |volume=60 | issue=4 | year=2011 |pages=1211\u20131214 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2011/00000060/00000004/art00026\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Buyck2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Buyck B, Hofstetter V, Eberhardt U, Verbeken A, Kauff F |year=2008|title=Walking the thin line between ''Russula'' and ''Lactarius'': the dilemma of ''Russula'' subsect.

They are often found growing on wood, and when on the ground have a preference for mossy habitats. This group is most noted for toxic species which are occasionally confused with hallucinogenic species of ''[[Psilocybe]]''.\n\n''Galerina'' means ''helmet-like''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5HGMPEiy4ykC&pg=PA34 Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians] by William C. Roody</ref>\n\n==Taxonomic definition==\nThe genus ''Galerina'' is defined as small mushrooms of [[wikt:mycenoid|mycenoid]] stature, that is, roughly similar in form to ''[[Mycena]]'' species: a small conical to bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] attached to a long and slender cartilaginous [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].  Species have a [[pileipellis]] that is a cutis, and ornamented spores that are brown in deposit, where the spore ornamentation comes from an extra spore covering.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Galerina patagonica 5927.jpg|thumb|left|Galerina sp. Marriott Falls Track, Tasmania, Australia]]\n''Galerina'' [[fruiting body|fruiting bodies]] are typically small, undistinguished mushrooms with a typical \"[[Mushroom hunting#.22Little brown mushrooms.22|little brown mushroom]]\" morphology and a yellow-brown, light brown to cinnamon-brown [[spore print]]. The [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] is typically [[Glossary of botanical terms#glabrous|glabrous]] and often [[hygrophanous]], and a [[Partial veil|cortina]]-type veil is present in young specimens of roughly half of recognized species, though it sometimes disappears as the mushroom ages in many of these species. Microscopically, they are highly variable as well, though most species have [[spores]] that are ornamented, lack a germ pore, and have a [[plage (mycology)|plage]]. Many species also have characteristic [[wiktionary:tibiiform|tibiiform]] [[cystidia]]. However, there are many exceptions, and many species of ''Galerina'' lack one or more of these microscopic characteristics. Ecologically, all ''Galerina'' are [[saprobic]], growing in habitats like rotting wood or in moss.<ref name=\"Gulden\"/>\n\nThe spores of ''Galerina'' feature an ornamentation that comes from the outer layer of the spore breaking up on maturity to produce either warts, wrinkles or \"ears\", flaps of material loosened from where the spore was attached to the [[basidia]].  This outer layer of the spore often is not complete, but has a clear patch in many species just above the attachment, this clear patch is called a [[plage (mycology)|plage]].  This plage is not evident in all species, and the spore covering does not always breakup in all species, making it sometimes difficult to correctly determine a mushroom of this genus.\n\nThe specific features that define the genus require a microscope to confirm.  In the wild it can be difficult to determine a ''Galerina'' from a number of similar genera, such as ''[[Pholiota]]'', ''[[Tubaria]]'', ''[[Conocybe]]'', ''[[Pholiotina]]'', ''[[Agrocybe]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus]]'', ''[[Phaeogalera]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe]]''.  For the most part, Galerinas will be found associated with [[moss]], and this can separate out the genus in nature fairly well.  But this identification is more difficult in the section Naucoriopsis, which does not associate with moss, and is a decomposer of wood.\n\n''[[Phaeogalera]]'' is a genus that was segregated from ''Galerina'' by K\u00fchner.<ref name=\"Kuhner\"/>\n\n==Phylogenetics==\n\n''Galerina'' has recently been found to be [[polyphyletic]],<ref name=\"Gulden\"/> consisting of at least three unrelated [[clades]], although not all species were studied and for most currently recognized species is uncertain still in which they belong.  Each of these clades corresponds to a subgenus of ''Galerina'', as outlined by K\u00fchner.<ref name=\"Kuhner\">{{cite journal |author=K\u00fchner R. |year=1972|title=Agaricales de la zone alpine: Genres ''Galera'' Earle et ''Phaeogalera'' gen. nov |journal=Bulletin Trimestriel de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mycologique de France |volume=88 |pages=41\u2013153}}</ref> The great diversity of [[wikt:micromorphology|micromorphology]] found in ''Galerina'' is probably due to the [[polyphyly]] of the genus.\n\n==Chemistry and toxicology==\nMany (though not all) ''Galerina'' contain [[alpha-amanitin]] and other [[amatoxins]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Enjalbert F, Cassanas G, Rapior S, Renault C, Chaumont JP |year=2004 |url=http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/subnamed/pdf/rapior/Rapior2004Mycologia.pdf |format=PDF |title=Amatoxins in wood-rotting ''Galerina marginata'' |journal=Mycologia |volume=96 |pages=720\u2013729 |doi=10.2307/3762106 |issue=4 |jstor=3762106 |pmid=21148893 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718164412/http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/subnamed/pdf/rapior/Rapior2004Mycologia.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-18 |df= }}</ref> ''Galerina steglichii'' is very rare, bruises blue and contains the hallucinogen [[psilocybin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gartz J. |year=1995 |url=http://leda.lycaeum.org/?ID=10423 |title=Cultivation and analysis of ''Psilocybe'' species and an investigation of ''Galerina steglichi'' |journal=Annali Museo Civico di Rovereto |volume=10 |pages=297\u2013306}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Besl H. |year= 1993 |title=''Galerina steglichii'' spec. nov, ein halluzinogener Haeubling |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mykologie |volume=59 |pages=215\u2013218}}</ref>\n\n{{mycomorphbox\n| name = Galerina sp.\n| whichGills = adnexed\n| capShape = convex\n| hymeniumType=gills\n| stipeCharacter=ring\n| stipeCharacter2=bare\n| ecologicalType=saprotrophic\n| sporePrintColor=yellow-orange\n| sporePrintColor2= brown\n| howEdible=deadly\n}}\n\n==Identification==\nThe extreme toxicity of some ''Galerina'' species means that recognition of ''Galerina'' is of great importance to [[mushroom hunters]] who are seeking hallucinogenic ''Psilocybe'' mushrooms.  Species like ''Galerina marginata'' may bear a superficial resemblance to ''[[Psilocybe cyanescens]]'' and other ''Psilocybe'' species, and has often been found growing amongst and around ''[[Psilocybe cyanescens]]'' and other ''Psilocybe'' species, making identification all the more confusing to the uninitiated. ''Galerina'' can be distinguished from psilocybin ''Psilocybe'' by the following characteristics:\n\n*[[Spore print]] color: blackish-brown to lilac-brown in ''Psilocybe'', light brown to rusty brown in ''Galerina''. Spore color can be seen by taking a spore print or by looking for evidence of spore drop on the stipe or on surrounding mushrooms.\n*Staining reaction: Psilocybin ''Psilocybe'' [[fruiting bodies]] stain blue to varying degrees when bruised, while ''Galerina'' do not. The strength of this reaction varies with the amount of [[psilocin]] present in the tissues of the mushroom.<ref name=Stamets1996>{{cite book |author=Stamets P. |title=Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World: An Identification Guide |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1996 |page=53 |isbn=978-0-89815-839-7 }}</ref> Fruiting bodies with little psilocin (such as [[Psilocybe Semilanceata]], with high psilocybin and low psilocin content) will stain weakly if at all, while sporocarps with a high psilocin content will stain strongly blue.

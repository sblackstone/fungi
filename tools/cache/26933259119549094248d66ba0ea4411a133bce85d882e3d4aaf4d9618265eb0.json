This fungus resembles a miniature bird's nest with numerous tiny \"eggs\"; the eggs, or ''peridioles'', are actually lens-shaped bodies that contain [[spore]]s. ''C.&nbsp;striatus'' can be distinguished from most other bird's nest fungi by its hairy exterior and grooved (''[[wikt:striate|striated]]'') inner walls. Although most frequently found growing on dead wood in open forests, it also grows on wood chip [[mulch]] in urban areas. The [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]] are encountered from summer until early winter. The color and size of this species can vary somewhat, but they are typically less than a centimeter wide and tall, and grey or brown in color. Another common name given to ''C.&nbsp;striatus'', '''splash cups''', alludes to the method of [[spore]] dispersal: the sides of the cup are angled such that falling drops of water can dislodge the peridioles and eject them from the cup.<ref name=\"Lincoff 1981\"/><ref name=\"kuo\"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''stria'', meaning \"with fine ridges or grooves\".<ref>Brodie, ''The Bird's Nest Fungi'', p. 173.</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Cyathus striatus'' was first [[species description|described]] by [[William Hudson (botanist)|William Hudson]] in his 1778 work ''Flora Anglica'' as ''Peziza striata''.<ref name=\"Hudson 1787\"/> [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow]] transferred it to ''[[Cyathus]]'' in 1787.<ref name=\"Willdenow 1787\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Cyathus striatus Buller.jpg|thumb|left|200px|a) young and mature fruiting bodies in longitudinal section; (b), (c) single peridioles\u2013entire, and in section<ref name=\"Gymme-Vaughan 1927\"/>]]\nThe \"nest\", or [[peridium]], is usually about 7 to 10&nbsp;mm in height and 6 to 8&nbsp;mm in width,<ref name=kuo/> but the size is somewhat variable and specimens have been found with heights and widths of up to {{convert|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Lincoff 1981\"/> The shape typically resembles a vase or inverted cone. The outer surface (''exoperidium'') ranges in color from slightly brownish to grayish [[buff (color)|buff]] to deep brown; the exoperidium has a shaggy or hairy texture (a ''tomentum''), with the hairs mostly pointing downward. The inner surface of the peridium (the ''endoperidium'') is striated or grooved, and shiny. Young specimens have a lid, technically called an ''epiphragm'', a thin membrane that covers the cup opening. The epiphragm is hairy like the rest of the exoperidial surface, but the hairs often wear off leaving behind a thin white layer stretched across the lid of the cup. As the peridium matures and expands, this membrane breaks and falls off, exposing the peridioles within.<ref name=\"Gates 1906\"/> The peridium is attached to its growing surface by a mass of closely packed [[hypha]]e called an emplacement; in ''C.&nbsp;striatus'' the maximum diameter of the emplacement is typically 8\u201312&nbsp;mm, and often incorporating small fragments of the growing surface into its structure.<ref>Brodie, ''The Bird's Nest Fungi'', p. 68.</ref>\n\n'''Peridiole structure'''\nThe peridioles are about 1 to 1.5&nbsp;mm wide and rarely up to 2&nbsp;mm wide. They are disc-shaped, but may appear angular due to pressure from neighbouring peridioles. Peridioles may be dark, or a drab gray if still covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.<ref name=Brodie175>Brodie, ''The Bird's Nest Fungi'', p. 175.</ref>[[File:Peridiole cross section.jpg|thumb|left|A peridiole and attached funiculus in cross-section]]Peridioles in ''C.&nbsp;striatus'' are sheathed and attached to the endoperidium by complex cords of [[mycelia]] known as a [[Peridium|funiculus]] in the singular. The funiculus is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. Inside the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the ''hapteron''. When dry the funiculus is brittle, but when wet it is capable of long extension.<ref name=\"Gates 1906\" />\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n\nThe [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells, are club-shaped with long stalks. They typically hold 4 spores that are sessile, that is, attached directly to the surface of the basidium, rather than by a short stalk (a ''sterigmata'').<ref name=\"Martin 1927\"/> [[Spore]]s measure about 15 to 20&nbsp;[[\u03bcm]] long by 8 to 12&nbsp;\u03bcm wide. They are elliptical, smooth, [[hyaline]], and notched at one end.<ref name=\"Lincoff 1981\"/><ref name=\"kuo\"/> During development, the spores are separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize along with other cells lining the inner walls of the peridiole. The spores expand in size somewhat after being detached from the basidia.<ref name=\"Martin 1927\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\n''Cyathus striatus'' is a [[saprobic]] fungus, deriving its nutrition from decaying organic material, and is typically found growing in clusters on small twigs or other woody debris. It is also common on [[mulch]] under shrubs.<ref name=\"Healy 2008\"/> The features of the microenvironment largely influence the appearance of ''C.&nbsp;striatus''; all else being equal, it is more likely to be found in moist, shallow depressions than elevated areas.<ref>Brodie, ''The Bird's Nest Fungi'', p. 101.</ref>  It is very widespread in [[temperate]] areas throughout the world,<ref name=\"Brodie175\" /> growing in summer and fall.<ref name=\"urlCyathus striatus\"/> The fungus has been recorded from Asia, Europe, North America, Central America, South America, and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Roberts 2011\"/>\n\n==Life cycle==\n[[File:Cyathus striatus Uurrepes\u00e4sieni H7618 C.jpg|thumb|right|The outer surface of ''C.&nbsp;striatus'' is covered with a shaggy or woolly tomentum.]]\n''Cyathus striatus'' can reproduce both asexually (via [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] spores), or sexually (with [[meiosis]]), typical of [[taxa]] in the [[basidiomycetes]] that contain both [[haploid]] and [[diploid]] stages. [[Basidiospore]]s produced in the peridioles each contain a single haploid [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. After the spores have been dispersed into a suitable growing environment, they germinate and develop into [[homokaryotic]] hyphae, with a single nucleus in each cell compartment. When two homokaryotic [[hypha]]e of different [[mating type|mating compatibility groups]] fuse with one another, they form a [[dikaryon|dikaryotic]] mycelia in a process called [[plasmogamy]]. After a period of time and under the appropriate environmental conditions, fruiting bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia. These fruiting bodies produce peridioles containing the [[basidia]] upon which new spores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores.<ref name=\"Deacon 2005\"/> The process of meiosis in ''C.&nbsp;striatus'' has been found to be similar to that of higher organisms.<ref name=\"Lu 1964\"/>\n\n==Spore dispersal==\nThe cone shaped fruiting body of ''Cyathus striatus'' makes use of a splash-cup mechanism to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits the interior of the cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached to the end of the funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a [[tetherball]]). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.<ref>Brodie, ''The Bird's Nest Fungi'', pp. 80\u201392.</ref>\n\n==Bioactive compounds==\n\n''Cyathus striatus'' has proven to be a rich source of [[natural product|bioactive]] chemical compounds. It was first reported in 1971 to produce \"indolic\" substances (compounds with an [[indole]] ring structure) as well as a complex of [[diterpenoid]] [[antibiotic]] compounds collectively known as ''[[cyathin]]s''.<ref name=\"Johri 1971\"/><ref name=\"Allbutt 1971\"/> Several years later, research revealed the indolic substances to be compounds now known as striatins. Striatins (A, B and C) have antibiotic activity against [[fungi imperfecti]], and various [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria.<ref name=\"Oberwinkler 1977\"/> ''C.&nbsp;striatus'' also produces [[sesquiterpene]] compounds called schizandronols.<ref name=\"Ayer 1982\"/> It also contains the [[triterpene]] compounds glochidone, glochidonol, glochidiol and glochidiol diacetate, cyathic acid, striatic acid, cyathadonic acid and epistriatic acid.<ref name=\"Ayer 1984\"/> The latter four compounds were unknown prior to their isolation from ''C.&nbsp;striatus''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Cyathus species|List of ''Cyathus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Allbutt 1971\">{{cite journal |year=1971 |vauthors=Allbutt AD, Ayer WA, Brodie HJ, Johri BN, Taube H |title=Cyathin, a new antibiotic complex produced by ''Cyathus helenae'' |volume=17 |issue=11 |pages=1401\u20137 |journal=Canadian Journal of Microbiology |doi=10.1139/m71-223 |pmid=5156938 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Ayer 1982\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ayer WA, Reffstrup T |title=Metabolites of bird's nest fungi.

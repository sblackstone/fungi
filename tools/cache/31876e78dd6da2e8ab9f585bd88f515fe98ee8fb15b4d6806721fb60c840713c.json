It was formerly known as ''Galera cyanopes''.\n\n==Description==\n*'''Cap''': 0.3 - 1(1.3) cm across [[Conic]] to [[wikt:convex|convex]] but expands to nearly plane in age, with a distinct umbo, smooth, ochraceous tawny to cinnamon-brown, darker at edges, glistening when wet, hygrophanous, even to [[wikt:striate|striate]] when moist. Lightens when it dries, turning a tan color.\n*'''Gills''': [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] to [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]], crowded to subdistant, narrow to moderately broad, pale grayish yellow to brown with whitish edges, darkening to rusty cinnamon brown in age. \n*'''Spores''': Cinnamon brown, (6.5)7.0 - 9.0 x 4.0 - 4.5(5) micrometers smooth and [[ellipsoid]] with thick walls and a small but distinct germ-pore.\n*'''[[Stipe (mycology)|Stipe]]''': (1)2 to 5(7.5) cm long, .75 - 1(1.5) mm thick, mostly equal but often slightly swollen at the base. Fragile, whitish with fine fibrils but becoming smooth, lacks an [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]], slightly twisting striatulations, often slightly grayish at the base when young, becoming an azure shade of blue in age, quickly bruising blue when handled.\n*'''Taste''': \n*'''Odor''': farinaceous.\n*'''Microscopic features''': Subcapitate cheilocystidia.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n\n''Pholiotina smithii'' is found in [[North America]] and often grows in bogs, ditches and swampy areas, commonly in [[sphagnum]] moss.  Also found along river banks and in lawns.\n\nIt is known to occur in [[Canada]], [[Oregon]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[Northern Michigan, (on ancient man-made earthen mounds)]], but is probably more widely distributed.\n\nOn the west coast of America, ''Pholiotina smithii'' is an early summer mushroom, almost never appearing after the first week of June.\n\n==Edibility==\n\nMildly hallucinogenic, containing [[psilocin]], [[psilocybin]], and [[baeocystin]].  Most mycologists recommend against eating this mushroom because it is difficult to distinguish from poisonous species.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Conocybe smithii 2 .jpg|Pholiotina smithii photos and information, by Jordan Luebben.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | first=Paul |last=Stamets | year=1996 | title=Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World | publisher=Ten Speed Press | location=Berkley | isbn=0-9610798-0-0}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.evergreen.edu/mushrooms/phm/s22.htm Conocybe smithii photo]\n* [http://www.museocivico.rovereto.tn.it/UploadDocs/104_art09-Guzman%20&%20C.pdf A Worldwide Geographical Distribution of the Neurotropic Fungi]\n\n{{Hallucinogenic mushrooms}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q4046862}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pholiotina smithii}}\n[[Category:Bolbitiaceae]]\n[[Category:Entheogens]]\n[[Category:Psychoactive fungi]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic tryptamine carriers]]"}]}}}}

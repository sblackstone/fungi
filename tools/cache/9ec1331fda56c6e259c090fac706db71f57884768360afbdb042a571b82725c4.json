It, like many of its relatives, can be found spread throughout wooded, moist areas in the southern United States, and has been found in areas ranging from [[California]] to [[Florida]]; it is also indigenous to [[Great Britain]] and [[Europe]]. ''A. semotus'' has also been collected in [[New Zealand]].<ref>Mitchell AD, Walter M. (1999). \"Species of ''Agaricus'' occurring in New Zealand\".

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gill]]s are free from the stalk and packed closely together, showing a pink to salmon color in youth and aging to a darker brown.[[Image:agaricus semotus section.jpg|left|thumb|A spore print and cross-section of ''A.&nbsp;semotus'']]\n\nThe [[Stipe (mycology)|stalk]] is 3&ndash;7&nbsp;cm tall and 0.4&ndash;0.8&nbsp;cm broad, and bruises yellow when handled. A [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] or remnants thereof are often evident, while the [[partial veil]] is often absent or minutely visible along the margin of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white throughout and stains yellow when bruised. The [[spore print]] is [[brown|dark brown]].\n\nThe taste is said to be slightly reminiscent of anise or almond while the odor is often more distinctive.\n\nThe [[spore]]s are 4.5&ndash;5.5 x 3&ndash;3.5&nbsp;[[micrometer|\u00b5m]], smooth, [[nonamyloid]], and elliptical. The [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells, are 4-spored, while the [[cystidia]] (relatively large non-spore producing cells typically found on the [[hymenium]]) are roughly club-shaped with thin walls.<ref name=\"isbn0-7112-2379-3\">{{cite book |author =Jordan, Michael |title=The encyclopedia of fungi of Britain and Europe |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |year=2004 |page=225 |isbn=0-7112-2379-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nIt has been reported as edible,<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Agaricus semotus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Agaricus_semotus.html |title=California Fungi: ''Agaricus semotus'' |work= |accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref><ref name=\"isbn0-89815-169-4\">{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms demystified: a comprehensive guide to the fleshy fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, Calif |year=1986 |page=340 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=vY8FXXrlHFMC&pg=PA339&dq=%22agaricus+semotus%22#PPA340,M1 Google Books]</ref> but others claim that it may cause gastrointestinal discomfort.<ref name=\"urlRogers Mushrooms | Mushroom Pictures & Mushroom Reference\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5498~gid~~source~gallerydefault.asp |title=Rogers Mushrooms &#124; Mushroom Pictures & Mushroom Reference |accessdate=2009-03-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118014753/http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5498~gid~~source~gallerydefault.asp |archivedate=2008-11-18 }}</ref><ref name=\"isbn0-7234-1576-5\">{{cite book |vauthors =Bisset NG, Breksinsky A, Bresinsky A, Besl H |title=A colour atlas of poisonous fungi: a handbook for pharmacists, doctors, and biologists |publisher=Wolfe Pub |location=London |year=1990 |page=118 |isbn=0-7234-1576-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EIcQGsZ2kksC&pg=PA118&dq=%22agaricus+semotus%22 Google Books]</ref> Arora notes that these mushrooms are \"rarely collected because of their small size.\"<ref name=\"isbn0-89815-169-4\" />\n\n==Phylogenetics==\n[[Phylogenetic]] analysis suggests that ''A. semotus'' belongs in a group of closely related species within the genus ''Agaricus'', known as the Arvensis [[clade]].

The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]].  Many sources report it has a bitter taste, but others have found it delicious and suspect that the bitter specimens may be similar related species.<ref name=\"Wells 1970\"/> The mushroom has a large, brownish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with large brown scales and may reach 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) in diameter. On the underside it sports greyish, brittle teeth instead of [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], and has white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]]. Its [[spore print]] is brown. It is associated with spruce (''[[Picea]]''), appearing in autumn. It ranges throughout North America and Europe, although collections from the British Isles are now assigned to the similar species ''[[Sarcodon squamosus]]''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Swedish botanist [[Olof Celsius]] reported in 1732 that ''Sarcodon imbricatus'' occurred in the vicinity of [[Uppsala]], and [[Carl Linnaeus]] wrote of it in his 1737 work ''Flora lapponica''.<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book |author1=Nilson S.  |author2=Persson O.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063005-8|page=76}}</ref> It was one of the species initially described by Linnaeus, as ''Hydnum imbricatum'', in the second volume of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Species Plantarum: Tomus II | publisher=Holmiae.

Furthermore, the mushroom has been used as a source of pigment and collectors noted that fresh specimens collected under pine yielded [[biological pigment|pigment]], but only old ones collected under spruce. [[molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analysis of the DNA revealed the two forms to be distinct genetically, and thus populations of what had been described as ''S.&nbsp;imbricatus'' were now assigned to ''[[Sarcodon squamosus]]'', which includes collections in the British Isles and the Netherlands.<ref name=Joh99>{{cite journal |author1=Johanneson H |author2=Ryman S |author3=Lundmark H |author4=Danell E. |year=1999|title=''Sarcodon imbricatus'' and ''S. squamosus'' \u2013 two confused species |journal=Mycological Research |volume=103 |issue=11 |pages=1447\u201352 |doi=10.1017/S0953756299008709}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe mushrooms, or fruiting bodies, can be quite large in size. the brownish or greyish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] measures up to 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) in diameter and is covered with coarse darker brown scales.

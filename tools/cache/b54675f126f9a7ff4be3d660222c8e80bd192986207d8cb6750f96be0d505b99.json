The mushrooms are characterized by their lilac color, the rusty-brown [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] and [[spore]]s, and rusty-brown [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] in the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was originally named ''Agaricus traganus'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"gassy webcap\"<ref name=EnglishCommonNames/> the \"lilac conifer Cortinarius\",<ref name=Arora1986/> or the \"pungent Cort\".<ref name=Bessette1997/>\n\nSome authorities consider the American variant to be a distinct species, ''Cortinarius pyriodorus'', reserving the name ''C.&nbsp;traganus'' for the European version.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:LilaDickfu\u00df.JPG|thumb|left|Young specimens]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|5|\u2013|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, initially spherical to convex, with the margin rolled inward, then flattened, sometimes with large, broad, central [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The margin often cracks star-like, particularly in dry weather. The mushroom is a pale azure violet to pale lilac color, soon bleaching and fading to tan brown or rusty brown. The cap is dry, silkily shiny or tomentose at the margin with membranaceous bronze fragments of the [[partial veil|veil]], the white fragments of which often adhere to the surface like scabs. Later the surface becomes cracked into small scales. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are sub-crowded, quite thick, broadly adnate, and often slightly emarginate (notched). They are {{convert|7|\u2013|15|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} broad, slightly dirty violet when young but usually brown, with only faintly violet tint, later brown, dusted saffron ochre, and with lighter crenulate edge. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|5|\u2013|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|\u2013|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, tough and thick, bulbously at the base, and spongily stuffed inside. It is vivid violet for a long time in the upper part above the cortina, paler below, and covered with a tough, whitish, boot-like veil, which usually leaves upright zones on the stem. The cortina is violet. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is saffron yellowish-brown to yellowish-brown from the beginning except at the tip of the stem where it is dirty violaceous, and smells very strongly and unpleasantly of goats, so much so that it may induce vomiting in more sensitive individuals. It has a strong, bitter taste, particularly when young.<ref name=Pilat1961/>\n\nThe [[basidium|basidia]] (the [[spore]]-bearing cells) are 30\u201335 by 6.5\u20137.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[spore print|spore deposit]] is rusty brown. The spores are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], covered with fine warts or dots, and measure 8\u20139 by 5\u20135.5&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Pilat1961/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Cortinarius camphoratus]]'' is similar in appearance and is also violet, but it has pale violet gills which soon turn rusty, and a longer stem with paling flesh at the base. Its spores are also longer, warty, and measure 8.5\u201311 by 5\u20136&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Evenson1997/> It has a pungent smell, somewhat different from that of ''C.&nbsp;traganus''\u2014similar to rotting potatoes.<ref name=Ammirati2009/> Another lookalike species is ''[[Cortinarius muricinus]]'' with the cap either permanently violet or becoming rust-colored from the disc outward. The gills are initially blue, dirty cinnamon when old, and the stem violet lilac, with lighter fragments of the veil later turning rust-colored. Its spores measure 13\u201315 by 7\u20138&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Pilat1961/>\n\n===Edibility===\nThe mushroom has been variously reported as \"mildly poisonous\",<ref name=McClintock1986/> or indigestible.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Cortinarius traganus'' is a widespread species that is found in [[coniferous forest]]s worldwide. It seems to prefer poorer soils, both [[siliceous]] and non-[[calcareous]]. It grows throughout the [[temperateness|temperate]] zone of the northern hemisphere.<ref name=Pilat1961/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Cortinarius species|List of ''Cortinarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Ammirati2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati J, Trudell S |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest: Timber Press Field Guide (Timber Press Field Guides) |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2009 |pages=158\u20139 |isbn=0-88192-935-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC&pg=PA160}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=447 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86tM01VsFG0C&pg=PA447}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette1997>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms of Northeastern North America |vauthors=Bessette A, Bessette AR, Fischer DW |year=1997 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |isbn=978-0-8156-0388-7 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2uU12XcRD4C&pg=PA112}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=EnglishCommonNames>{{cite web |url=http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/ENGLISH_NAMES.pdf |title=Recommended English Names for Fungi in the UK |format=PDF |publisher=[[British Mycological Society]] |access-date=2012-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716083053/http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/ENGLISH_NAMES.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Evenson1997>{{cite book  |author=Evenson VS |title=Mushrooms of Colorado and the Southern Rocky Mountains |year=1997 |publisher=Westcliffe Publishers |location= |isbn=978-1-56579-192-3 |page=120 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAeDeyqZLq0C&pg=PA120}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=McClintock1986>{{cite book |vauthors=McClintock ER, Fuller TH |title=Poisonous Plants of California |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=47 |isbn=0-520-05569-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-op0XwlDmQC&pg=PA47}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Pilat1961>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms and other Fungi |vauthors=Pilat \u00c1, U\u0161\u00e1k O |year=1961 |publisher=Peter Nevill |location=London, UK |page=108}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlSpecies Fungorum - Species synonymy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=164677 |title=''Cortinarius traganus'' (Fr.)

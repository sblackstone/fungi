It grows in silicate soil in the summer and autumn months. It bears a pale yellow or sometimes white cap, with white stem, ring and volva. Though it is not poisonous, its similarity to the lethal death cap (''[[Amanita phalloides]]'') precludes its use in cooking.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Amanita.citrina2.-.lindsey.jpg|thumb|left|Closer view of gills and ring of an Amanita citrina from Commanster, Belgium.]]\nThis mushroom has a fleshy pale yellow, or sometimes white, [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] from {{convert|4|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} across, covered in irregular patches. The [[gill]]s and flesh are white. There is a large [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] at the base of the {{convert|6|\u2013|8|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} tall stem, which has a clear ring. This mushroom is not eaten, having a smell of [[rapeseed]] or [[potato]]. It is often confused with the related death cap mushroom ''([[Amanita phalloides]])'', hence the name.<ref name = \"Ultimatemush\">{{cite book| author = P. Jordan & S. Wheeler | year = 2001 | title = The Ultimate Mushroom Book | publisher = Hermes House | ISBN =}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe false death cap is found in [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] woodlands in Autumn in [[Europe]].<ref name = \"Ultimatemush\"/> It is also found in [[North American]] oak and pine forests.\n\n==Toxicity==\nIt has been shown that this mushroom contains the [[alpha-amanitin]] toxin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, the amounts of this toxin were found to be very small and would not cause any adverse effects unless the mushroom was ingested in very large amounts. The biggest danger with this species is its marked similarity to the death cap, which is reason enough to avoid it, even though it is edible.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Amanita citrina3.jpg|A closer view of an emergent specimen.\nFile:Amanita.citrina.-.lindsey.jpg|Amanita citrina from Commanster, Belgium.\nFile:Amanita citrina 1.jpg| Amanita citrina at the 12-th countrywide mushroom exhibition 2008, \u017dof\u00edn, Prague, Czech Republic.\nFile:Amanita citrina 2010 G1.jpg|''A. citrina'' in [[Ukraine]] (Co-ordinates:{{coord|49|19|20.03|N|28|33|29.20|E}}).\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Amanita citrina}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita_citrina.html Amanita citrina] on Mushroomexpert.com\n\n{{Amanitas}}\n{{Hallucinogenic mushrooms}}\n\n{{Italic title}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q935729}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amanita Citrina}}\n[[Category:Amanita|citrina]]\n[[Category:Inedible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1797]]"}]}}}}

The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of this mushroom is about {{convert|70|\u2013|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, greyish brown to brown. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] start out white but they soon turn pink. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white and has a [[volva (mycology)|volva]] at the base. Microscopical features and [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence data]] are of great importance for separating this [[taxon]] from related species. ''V.&nbsp;asiaticus'' is a [[saprotrophic]] fungus that was originally described as growing on the ground, in the [[humus]] layer. It is only known from [[Hokkaido]] ([[Japan]]).\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nThe [[Type (biology)|type collection]] of this species was originally reported under the name ''[[Volvopluteus gloiocephalus|Volvariella gloiocephala]]'' by Takehashi and colleagues in 2010.<ref name=Takehashi2010/> [[morphology (biology)|Morphological]] revision and [[DNA sequence|DNA sequence data]] obtained from these specimens showed that this [[taxon]] belongs in the genus ''[[Volvopluteus]]'' and that is a separate species from all the other members of that genus.<ref name=Justo2011/><ref name=Justo2011b/>\n\nThe [[botanical name|epithet]] ''asiaticus'' makes reference to the fact that this species was originally described, and thus far only known, from Asia. The type collection of this species is preserved at the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]].\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Macroscopic characters ===\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''Volvopluteus asiaticus'' is between {{convert|70|and|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, more or less ovate or conical when young, then expands to convex or flat, it can have an [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]] at center in mature specimens; the surface is markedly viscid in fresh [[basidiocarps]] and rugose, with powdery, minute, whitish scales. The color varies from greyish brown to brown, with a dark brown center. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded, free from the stipe, [[ventricose]], up to {{convert|9|mm|in|abbr=on}} broad; white when young and turning pink with age. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|85|\u2013|99|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|9|\u2013|21|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide, clavate with a bulbous base; the surface is white, smooth or striate. The [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] is sacciform, white and with a smooth surface, up to {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} high. The [[Context (mycology)|context]] is white on stipe and pileus, and it does not change when bruised or exposed to air, but it is dark grey-brown right under the [[pileipellis]]. Data on smell, taste and [[spore print]] were not recorded.<ref name=Takehashi2010/><ref name=Justo2011b/>\n\n=== Microscopic characters ===\nThe [[basidiospores]] are 12\u201314.5 by 7\u20138.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] and [[ellipsoid]]. [[Basidia]] are 29\u201345 by 10\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m and four-spored. [[Pleurocystidia]] are 45\u201385 by 12\u201330&nbsp;\u00b5m, fusiform or utriform, and commonly have an apical excrescence up to 10\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m long. [[Cheilocystidia]] are 45\u201370 by 14\u201325&nbsp;\u00b5m, mostly lageniform, a few clavate, utriform or ovate; they completely cover the gill edge. The [[pileipellis]] is an ixocutis <ref name=Vellinga1988/> (parallel [[hyphae]] wide embedded in a gelatinous matrix), while the [[Pellis|Stipitipellis]] is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix).<ref name=Vellinga1988/> [[Caulocystidia]] are sometimes present, and they measure 100\u2013250 by 10\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m, mostly cylindrical.<ref name=Takehashi2010/><ref name=Justo2011b/>\n\n<gallery widths=\"175px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Asiaticus pleurocystidia.jpg|<center>Pleurocystidia of ''Volvopluteus asiaticus''</center>\nFile:Asiaticus cheilocystidia.jpg|<center>Cheilocystidia of ''Volvopluteus asiaticus''</center>\n</gallery>\n\n=== Ecology ===\n''Volvopluteus asiaticus'' is a [[saprotrophic]] mushroom. The type collection was collected on the ground, in a forest area.<ref name=Takehashi2010/>\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species is only known from the [[type locality (biology)|type locality]]: Tonebetsu Nature Park in Hokkaido, Japan.<ref name=Takehashi2010/>\n\n== Similar species ==\n[[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analyses of the [[Internal transcribed spacer|internal transcribed spacer region]] clearly separate the four species currently recognized in ''Volvopluteus'' but morphological identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the basidiocarps, color of the pileus, spore size, presence or absence of cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus. ''Volvopluteus asiaticus'' stands apart from other species by the pleurocystidia provided with apical excrescences and the cheilocystidia that are predominantly lageniform.<ref name=Justo2011b/>\n\n[[File:Phylogeny asiaticus.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Phylogeny|Phylogenetic]] relationships between ''Volvopluteus asiaticus'' and the other species of the genus as inferred from [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] data, based on the results presented by Justo et al.<ref name=Justo2011b/>]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Justo2011>{{cite journal |vauthors=Justo A, Vizzini A, Minnis AM, Menolli Jr N, Capelari M, Rodr\u00edguez O, Malysheva E, Contu M, Ghignone S, Hibbett DS |title=Phylogeny of the Pluteaceae (Agaricales, Basidiomycota): Taxonomy and character evolution |journal=Fungal Biology |year=2011 |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201320 |doi=10.1016/j.funbio.2010.09.012 |url=http://www.clarku.edu/faculty/dhibbett/Reprints%20PDFs/Phylogeny_Pluteaceae.pdf |pmid=21215950}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Vellinga1988>{{cite book |author=Vellinga EC. |chapter=Glossary |editor-last=Bas |title=Flora Agaricina Neerlandica |volume=1 |edition=1st |publisher=AA Balkema |location=Rotterdam, Netherlands |year=1988 |pages=54\u201364 |isbn=90-6191-859-6|display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Takehashi2010>{{cite book |vauthors=Takehashi S, Hoshina T, Kasuya T |title=Taxonomic Studies on Agaricales of Hokkaido, Northern Japan, with special references to ''Melanoleuca'', ''Oudemansiella'', ''Xerula'', ''Volvariella'' and ''Pluteus'' |publisher=NPO, The Forum of Fungi in Northern Japan |location=Sapporo, Japan |year=2010}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Justo2011b>{{cite journal |author1=Justo A |author2=Minnis AM |author3=Ghignone S |author4=Menolli N Jr. |author5=Capelari M |author6=Rodr\u00edguez O |author7=Malysheva E |author8=Contu M |author9=Vizzini A. |title=Species recognition in ''Pluteus'' and ''Volvopluteus'' (Pluteaceae, Agaricales): Morphology, geography and phylogeny |journal=Mycological Progress |year=2011 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=453\u2013479 |url=http://www.clarku.edu/faculty/dhibbett/Reprints%20PDFs/Pluteus_Volvopluteus.pdf |doi=10.1007/s11557-010-0716-z}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q16760245}}\n\n[[Category:Pluteaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 2011]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]"}]}}}}

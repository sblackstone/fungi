Prior to 2001, the species '''''G.&nbsp;autumnalis''''', '''''G.&nbsp;oregonensis''''', '''''G.&nbsp;unicolor''''', and '''''G.&nbsp;venenata''''' were thought to be separate due to differences in habitat and the [[wikt:viscidity|viscidity]] of their [[pileus (mycology)|caps]], but [[phylogenetic]] analysis showed that they are all the same species.\n\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of this fungus have brown to yellow-brown caps that fade in color when drying. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are brownish and give a rusty [[spore print]]. A well-defined membranous [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] is typically seen on the [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] of young specimens but often disappears with age. In older fruit bodies, the caps are flatter and the gills and stems browner. The species is a classic \"[[Mushroom hunting#\"Little brown mushrooms\"|little brown mushroom]]\"\u2014a catchall category that includes all small to medium-sized, hard-to-identify brownish mushrooms, and may be easily confused with several [[edible mushroom|edible]] species.\n\n''Galerina marginata'' is widespread in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], including Europe, North America, and Asia, and has also been found in Australia. It is a [[wood-rotting fungus]] that grows predominantly on decaying [[conifer]] wood. An extremely poisonous species, it contains the same deadly [[amatoxin]]s found in the death cap (''[[Amanita phalloides]]''). Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe [[liver damage]] with vomiting, diarrhea, [[hypothermia]], and eventual death if not treated rapidly. About ten poisonings have been attributed to the species now grouped as ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' over the last century.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n\nWhat is now recognized as a single [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] variable [[taxon]] named ''Galerina marginata'' was once split into five distinct species. Norwegian mycologist [[Gro Gulden]] and colleagues concluded that all five represented the same species after comparing the DNA sequences of the [[internal transcribed spacer]] region of [[ribosomal DNA]] for various North American and European specimens in ''[[Galerina]]'' section ''Naucoriopsis''. The results showed no genetic differences between ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' and ''G.&nbsp;autumnalis'', ''G.&nbsp;oregonensis'', ''G.&nbsp;unicolor'', and ''G.&nbsp;venenata'', thus reducing all these names to [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]].<ref name=Gulden2001/> The oldest of these names are ''Agaricus marginatus'', described by [[August Batsch]] in 1789,<ref name=Batsch1789/> and ''Agaricus unicolor'', described by [[Martin Vahl]] in 1792.<ref name=Vahl1792/> ''Agaricus autumnalis'' was described by [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1873, and later moved to ''Galerina'' by [[Alexander Hanchett Smith|A.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Smith]] and [[Rolf Singer]] in their 1962 worldwide [[monograph]] on that genus. In the same publication they also introduced the ''G.&nbsp;autumnalis'' [[variety (botany)|varieties]] ''robusta'' and ''angusticystis''.<ref name=Smith-Autumnalis/> Another of the synonymous species, ''G.&nbsp;oregonensis'', was first described in that monograph. ''Galerina venenata'' was first identified as a species by Smith in 1953.<ref name=Smith1953/> Since ''Agaricus marginatus'' is the oldest validly published name, it has [[priority (nomenclature)|priority]] according to the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|rules of botanical nomenclature]].<ref name=\"url MushroomExpert.Com\"/>\n[[File:Galerina marginata 63803 crop.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Acute-ended [[cystidia]] are characteristic of ''Galerina'' species in the section ''Naucoriopsis''.|alt=A translucent, pointed cell with a rounded tip extending upwards into a clear area. Its base is embedded amongst a layer of poorly-resolved smaller cells most of which are attached to up to four smaller oval brownish cells.]]\nAnother species analysed in Gulden's 2001 study, ''[[Galerina pseudomycenopsis]]'', also could not be distinguished from ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' based on ribosomal DNA sequences and [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain ''G.&nbsp;pseudomycenopsis'' as a distinct species.<ref name=Gulden2001/> A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in [[mating in fungi|mating]] experiments suggests that the species are distinct.<ref name=Gulden2005/>\n\nIn the fourth edition (1986) of Singer's comprehensive [[classification (biology)|classification]] of the [[Agaricales]], ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' is the [[type species]] of ''Galerina'' section ''Naucoriopsis'', a subdivision first defined by French mycologist [[Robert K\u00fchner]] in 1935.<ref name=Kuhner1935/> It includes small brown-spored mushrooms characterized by cap edges initially curved inwards, fruit bodies resembling ''[[Pholiota]]'' or ''[[Naucoria]]''<ref>Smith and Singer, 1964, p. 235.</ref> and thin-walled, obtuse or acute-ended pleurocystidia that are not rounded at the top. Within this section, ''G.&nbsp;autumnalis'' and ''G.&nbsp;oregonensis'' are in [[wikt:stirps|stirps]] ''Autumnalis'', while ''G.&nbsp;unicolor'', ''G.&nbsp;marginata'', and ''G.&nbsp;venenata'' are in stirps ''Marginata''. ''Autumnalis'' species are characterized by having a viscid to lubricous cap surface while ''Marginata'' species lack a gelatinous cap\u2014the surface is moist, \"fatty-shining\", or matte when wet.<ref name=\"Singer1986\"/> However, as Gulden explains, this characteristic is highly variable: \"Viscidity is a notoriously difficult character to assess because it varies with the age of the fruitbody<!--[sic]--> and the weather conditions during its development. Varying degrees of viscidity tend to be described differently and applied inconsistently by different persons applying terms such as lubricous, fatty, fatty-shiny, sticky, viscid, glutinous, or (somewhat) slimy.\"<ref name=Gulden2001/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''marginata'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word for \"margin\" or \"edge\",<ref name=Neill2005/> while ''autumnalis'' means \"of the autumn\".<ref>Evenson, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EAeDeyqZLq0C&lpg=PA124&dq=Galerina%20autumnalis&lr=&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q=Galerina%20autumnalis&f=false p. 124.] Retrieved 2010-03-04.</ref> [[Common name]]s of the species include the \"marginate Pholiota\" (resulting from its synonymy with ''Pholiota marginata''),<ref name=Bresinsky1989/> \"funeral bell\",<ref name=Mitchell2006/> \"deadly skullcap\", and \"deadly Galerina\". ''G.&nbsp;autumnalis'' was known as the \"fall Galerina\" or the \"autumnal Galerina\", while ''G.&nbsp;venenata'' was the \"deadly lawn Galerina\".<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/><ref name=Ammirati1987/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Galerina marginata 63678.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Young fruit bodies have margins rolled inwards.|alt=A few dozen brownish-orange mushrooms of various sizes growing on a rotted log covered with moss. The caps of the mushrooms are rolled inwards, and rest on stems that range in color from whitish to light orange-brown. Several of the stems have small, dark orange rings near the top.]]\n[[File:Galerina marginata 61108.jpg|thumb|180px|left|View of gills and stem|alt=Two mushrooms, with brownish-orange caps, the shapes of hemispheres, laid on their sides. One mushroom shows its gills, which are very light brown in color, and a stem that ranges from whitish near the top to the same brown color as the cap near its base. Close to the top, near the attachment to the cap, the stem has a membranous ring of whitish-light brown tissue.]]\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] reaches {{convert|1.7|to|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. It starts convex, sometimes broadly conical, and has edges (margins) that are curved in against the [[Lamellae (mycology)|gills]]. As the cap grows and expands, it becomes broadly convex and then flattened, sometimes developing a central elevation, or [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], which may project prominently from the cap surface.<ref name=Bresinsky1989/>\n\nBased on the collective descriptions of the five taxa now considered to be ''G.&nbsp;marginata'', the texture of the surface shows significant variation. Smith and Singer give the following descriptions of surface texture: from \"viscid\" (''G.&nbsp;autumnalis''),<ref name=Smith-Autumnalis/> to \"shining and viscid to lubricous when moist\" (''G.&nbsp;oregonensis''),<ref name=Smith-Oregonensis/> to \"shining, lubricous to subviscid (particles of dirt adhere to surface) or merely moist, with a fatty appearance although not distinctly viscid\",<ref name=Smith-Unicolor/> to \"moist but not viscid\" (''G.&nbsp;marginata'').<ref name=Smith-Marginata/> The cap surface remains smooth and changes colors with humidity ([[hygrophanous]]), pale to dark [[ochre|ochraceous]] [[tawny (color)|tawny]] over the disc and yellow-ochraceous on the margin (at least when young), but fading to dull tan or darker when dry. When moist, the cap is somewhat transparent so that the outlines of the gills may be seen as striations. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is pale brownish ochraceous to nearly white, thin and pliant, with an odor and taste varying from very slightly to strongly like flour ([[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]]).<ref name=Smith-Marginata/>\n\nThe gills are typically narrow and crowded together, with a broadly [[adnation|adnate]] to nearly [[decurrent]] attachment to the stem and convex edges. They are a pallid brown when young, becoming tawny at maturity. Some short gills, called lamellulae, do not extend entirely from the cap edge to the stem, and are intercalated among the longer gills. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] ranges from {{convert|3|to|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|3|to|9|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick at the apex, and stays equal in width throughout or is slightly enlarged downward. Initially solid, it becomes hollow from the bottom up as it matures. The membranous [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] is located on the upper half of the stem near the cap, but may be sloughed off and missing in older specimens. Its color is initially whitish or light brown, but usually appears a darker rusty-brown in mature specimens that have dropped spores on it. Above the level of the ring, the stem surface has a very fine whitish powder and is paler than the cap; below the ring it is brown down to the reddish-brown to [[bistre]] base. The lower portion of the stem has a thin coating of pallid [[wikt:fibril|fibrils]] which eventually disappear and do not leave any scales. The [[spore print]] is rusty-brown.<ref name=Smith-Marginata/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n[[File:Galerina marginata 63831.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Spores, 1000x magnification|alt=Several dozen light brown objects, somewhat resembling seeds, on a clear background.]]\nThe spores measure 8\u201310 by 5\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]], and are slightly [[wikt:inequilateral|inequilateral]] in profile view, and egg-shaped in face view. Like all ''Galerina'' species, the spores have a [[plage (mycology)|plage]], which has been described as resembling \"a slightly wrinkled plastic shrink-wrap covering over the distal end of the spore\".<ref name=\"url Tom Volk 2003\"/> The spore surface is warty and full of wrinkles, with a smooth depression where the spore was once attached via the [[wikt:sterigmatum|sterigmatum]] to the [[basidium]] (the spore-bearing cell). When in [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solution, the spores appear tawny or darker rusty-brown, with an apical callus. The basidia are four-spored (rarely with a very few two-spored ones), roughly cylindrical when producing spores, but with a slightly tapered base, and measure 21\u201329 by 5\u20138.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Smith-Marginata/>\n\n[[Cystidia]] are cells of the fertile [[hymenium]] that do not produce spores. These sterile cells, which are structurally distinct from the basidia, are further classified according to their position. In ''G.&nbsp;marginata'', the pleurocystidia (cystidia from the gill sides) are 46\u201360 by 9\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m, thin-walled, and [[hyaline]] in KOH, [[wikt:fusoid|fusoid]] to [[ventricose]] in shape with wavy necks and blunt to [[wikt:subacute|subacute]] apices (3\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m diameter near apex). The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges) are similar in shape but often smaller than the pleurocystidia, abundant, with no club-shaped or abruptly tapering ([[wikt:mucronate|mucronate]]) cells present. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the [[hyphae]].<ref name=Smith-Marginata/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Kuehneromyces.mutabilis.-.lindsey.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Kuehneromyces mutabilis]]'' is one of several edible lookalike species.|alt=About two dozen brownish-orange mushrooms clustered together and growing on a piece of wood that is itself covered with green moss. In the center of each of the mushroom caps is a distinct circular region that is a slightly different color (both darker and lighter) that the rest of the cap.]]\n''Galerina marginata'' may be mistaken for a few [[edible mushroom]] species. ''[[Pholiota mutabilis]]'' (Kuehneromyces mutabilis) produces fruit bodies roughly similar in appearance and also grows on wood, but may be distinguished from ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' by its stems bearing scales up to the level of the ring, and from growing in large clusters (which is not usual of ''G.&nbsp;marginata''). However, the possibility of confusion is such that this good edible species is \"not recommended to those lacking considerable experience in the identification of higher fungi.\"<ref name=\"Smith1975\"/> Furthermore, microscopic examination shows smooth spores in ''Pholiota''.<ref name=\"Orr1979\"/> ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' may be easily confused with other edibles such as ''[[Armillaria mellea]]'' and ''[[Kuehneromyces mutabilis]]''.<ref name=Enjalbert2004/> Regarding the latter species, one source notes \"Often, ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' bears an astonishing resemblance to this fungus, and it requires careful and acute powers of observation to distinguish the poisonous one from the edible one.\"<ref name=Bresinsky1989/> ''K.&nbsp;mutabilis'' may be distinguished by the presence of scales on the stem below the ring, the larger cap, which may reach a diameter of {{convert|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and spicy or aromatic odor of the flesh. The related ''[[Kuehneromyces vernalis|K.&nbsp;vernalis]]'' is a rare species and even more similar in appearance to ''G.&nbsp;marginata''. Examination of microscopic characteristics is typically required to reliably distinguish between the two, revealing smooth spores with a [[germ pore]].<ref name=Bresinsky1989/>\n\nAnother potential edible lookalike is the \"velvet foot\", ''[[Flammulina velutipes]]''. This species has gills that are white to pale yellow, a white spore print, and spores that are elliptical, smooth, and measure 6.5\u20139 by 2.5\u20134&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Abel1993/> A rough resemblance has also been noted with the edible ''[[Hypholoma capnoides]]'',<ref name=Bresinsky1989/> the 'magic' mushroom [[Psilocybe subaeruginosa]] as well as ''[[Conocybe filaris]]'', another poisonous amatoxin-containing species.<ref name=Evenson1997/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Galerina marginata'' is a [[detritivore|saprobic]] fungus,<ref name=\"url MushroomExpert.Com\"/> obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter. It is known to have most of the major classes of secreted [[enzyme]]s that dissolve plant [[cell wall]] [[polysaccharide]]s, and has been used as a model saprobe in recent studies of [[mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] fungi.<ref name=Nagendran2009/><ref name=Baldrian2009/> Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of [[conifer]]s, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well.<ref name=Enjalbert2004/><ref name=Gulden2001/> Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.<ref name=Ammirati1987/>\n\n''Galerina marginata'' is widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, found in North America, Europe, Japan, Iran,<ref name=Asef2010/> continental Asia, and the [[Caucasus]].<ref name=Smith-Marginata/><ref name=Gulden1999/><ref name=Imazeki1987/> In North America, it has been collected as far north as the [[boreal forest of Canada]]<ref name=Bossenmaier1997/> and [[subarctic]] and [[arctic]] habitats in [[Labrador]],<ref name=Noordeloos1992/> and south to [[Jalisco, Mexico]].<ref name=Vargas1993/> It is also found in Australia.<ref name=Midgley2007/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Galerina autumnalis 47575.jpg|image2=Alpha-amanitin_structure.png|width=250|caption1=''Galerina marginata'' contains deadly amounts of amatoxins.|caption2=Alpha-amanitin chemical structure}}\nThe toxins found in ''Galerina marginata'' are known as [[amatoxin]]s. Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide derivatives composed of an [[amino acid]] ring bridged by a [[sulfur]] atom and characterized by differences in their [[substituent|side groups]]; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal [[mushroom poisoning]]s in humans. The amatoxins inhibit the [[enzyme]] [[RNA polymerase II]], which copies the [[genetic code]] of DNA into [[messenger RNA]] molecules. The toxin naturally accumulates in [[hepatocyte|liver cells]], and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins. Amatoxins also lead to [[kidney failure]] because, as the kidneys attempt to filter out poison, it damages the [[Kidney tubule#Renal tubule|convoluted tubules]] and reenters the blood to recirculate and cause more damage. Initial [[symptoms]] after ingestion include severe [[abdominal pain]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]] which may last for six to nine hours. Beyond these symptoms, toxins severely affect the liver which results in [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], a [[coma]], kidney failure, or even death, usually within seven days of consumption.<ref name=\"North\"/>\n\n''Galerina marginata'' was shown in various studies to contain the amatoxins [[alpha-amanitin|\u03b1-amanitin]] and [[gamma-amanitin|\u03b3-amanitin]], first as ''G.&nbsp;venenata'',<ref name=Tyler1963/> then as ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' and ''G.&nbsp;autumnalis''.<ref name=Tyler1963b/> The ability of the fungus to produce these toxins was confirmed by growing the [[mycelium]] as a [[microbiological culture|liquid culture]] (only trace amounts of [[beta-amanitin|\u03b2-amanitin]] were found).<ref name=Benedict1966/> ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' is thought to be the only species of the amatoxin-producing genera that will produce the toxins while growing in culture.<ref name=Benedict1967/> Both amanitins were quantified in ''G.&nbsp;autumnalis'' (1.5&nbsp;mg/g [[dry matter|dry weight]])<ref name=Johnson1976/> and ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' (1.1&nbsp;mg/g dry weight).<ref name=Andary1979/> Later experiments confirmed the occurrence of \u03b3-amanitin and \u03b2-amanitin in German specimens of ''G.&nbsp;autumnalis'' and ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' and revealed the presence of the three amanitins in the fruit bodies of ''G.&nbsp;unicolor''.<ref name=Besl1984/> Although some mushroom [[field guide]]s claim that the species (as ''G.&nbsp;autumnalis'') also contains [[phallotoxin]]s (however phallotoxins cannot be absorbed by humans),<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/><ref name=\"Miller2006\"/> scientific evidence does not support this contention.<ref name=Enjalbert2004/> A 2004 study determined that the amatoxin content of ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' varied from 78.17 to 243.61&nbsp;\u00b5g/g of fresh weight. In this study, the amanitin amounts from certain ''Galerina'' specimens were higher than those from some ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'', a European fungus generally considered as the richest in amanitins. The authors suggest that \"other parameters such as extrinsic factors (environmental conditions) and intrinsic factors (genetic properties) could contribute to the significant variance in amatoxin contents from different specimens.\"<ref name=Enjalbert2004/> The lethal dose of amatoxins has been estimated to be about 0.1&nbsp;mg/kg human body weight, or even lower.<ref name=Wieland1986/> Based on this value, the ingestion of 10 ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' fruit bodies containing about 250&nbsp;\u00b5g of amanitins per gram of fresh tissue could poison a child weighing approximately {{convert|20|kg|lb}}. However, a 20-year retrospective study of more than 2100 cases of amatoxin poisonings from North American and Europe showed that few cases were due to ingestion of ''Galerina'' species. This low frequency may be attributed to the mushroom's nondescript appearance as a \"[[little brown mushroom]]\" leading to it being overlooked by collectors, and by the fact that 21% of amatoxin poisonings were caused by unidentified species.<ref name=Enjalbert2004/>\n\nThe toxicity of certain ''Galerina'' species has been known for a century. In 1912, [[Charles Horton Peck]] reported a human poisoning case due to ''G.&nbsp;autumnalis''.<ref name=Peck1912/> In 1954, a poisoning was caused by ''G.&nbsp;venenata''.<ref name=Grossman1954/> Between 1978 and 1995, ten cases caused by amatoxin-containing Galerinas were reported in the literature. Three European cases, two from Finland<ref name=Elonen1978/> and one from France<ref name=Bauchet1983/> were attributed to ''G.&nbsp;marginata'' and ''G.&nbsp;unicolor'', respectively.

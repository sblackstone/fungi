The fungi generally identified as ''L. uvidus'' are part of a [[species complex|complex]] of closely related species and varieties which are difficult to delimit definitively.<ref name=\"Kuo\">Kuo, M.

On the ''MushroomExpert.Com'' Web site: [http://www.mushroomexpert.com/lactarius_uvidus.html]\n</ref>\n\nIt gives its name to the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Uvidi'' within the genus ''[[Lactarius]]''.  It is generally thought to be [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] (but Moser classifies it as edible with reservations).<ref name=\"Moser\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Lactarius uvidus'' was first described by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as ''Agaricus uvidus'' in 1818, before being given its current binomial name by the same author in 1838.\n\n==Description==\n<ref name=\"Moser\">Meinhard Moser, translated by Simon Plant: ''Keys to Agarics and Boleti'' (Roger Phillips 1983)  {{ISBN|0-9508486-0-3}}.</ref><ref name=\"Bon\">Marcel Bon: \"The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North-Western Europe\" Hodder & Stoughton {{ISBN|0-340-39935-X}}.</ref><ref name=Phillips>Phillips, Roger (1981) Entry in \"Mushrooms and other fungi of Great Britain & Europe\" published by Pan Books Ltd., Cavaye Place, London SW10 9PG.</ref><ref name=\"Courtecuisse\">Courtecuisse, R. & Duhem, B.

It is flat-topped or sometimes becomes centrally depressed when older.  The surface is greasy or viscous when damp.\n*The [[gill]]s are slightly [[decurrent]] and have a creamy colour, tending to become spotted violet by the milk where damaged.\n*The milk is initially white and turns violet, but only if left in contact with the gills or flesh.<ref name=\"Courtecuisse\"/> The milk and the flesh taste slightly bitter.\n*The pallid [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] grows up to about 8&nbsp;cm high by 2&nbsp;cm diameter, becoming hollow with age.\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:Distribution of Lactarius uvidus.svg|thumb|Distribution of ''Lactarius uvidus'' in Europe.]]\nThis cluster of species is found  in deciduous and coniferous woods, with a preference towards acid soils.  It has a wide distribution in Europe, North Africa, and North America, being fairly common in some regions but rare in others.<ref name=\"Courtecuisse\"/>   It appears classified as vulnerable or endangered in the Danish and Dutch Red Lists of Fungi.<ref>See [http://www.sns.dk/netpub/rodliste/71.htm the Danish Fungus red list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212064149/http://www.sns.dk/netpub/rodliste/71.htm |date=2007-12-12 }} where this species is classed as vulnerable (\"s\u00e5rbar\").</ref><ref>See [http://www.mycologen.nl/index_e.htm Nederlandse Mycologische Vereniging (Dutch Mycological Society) site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204013858/http://www.mycologen.nl/index_e.htm |date=2007-12-04 }} and in particular  [http://www.paddestoelenkartering.nl/downloads/RodeLijst.txt the text of the red list] where this species is classed as endangered (\"Bedreigd\").</ref>\n\n==Related species==\n''Lactarius uvidus'' belongs to section ''Uvidi'' of the genus, the members of which are characterized by milk which discolours violet, and by the greasy cap surface.  These mushrooms are divided into two sub-sections: the ''Aspidieni'', which have a whitish, ochre or greyish cap, and the ''Uvidini'' (including ''L. uvidus''), which have a lilac, violaceous, or brownish cap.  A more complete list of these species can be found in the [[List of Lactarius species]].\n\nSome less well-known but closely related European species are ''L. pseudouvidus'' K\u00fchner (1985) (found in alpine zone, up to 4&nbsp;cm in diameter, with ochraceous yellow gills), ''L. robertianus'' Bon (1985) (also alpine, darker coloured, with smell of cedar wood), and ''L. luridus'' (Pers.) Gray (1821) (whose milk goes a deep violet).  Since ''L. uvidus'' seems to be a cluster of species, it is particularly difficult to pin down the correspondence between  descriptions and collections originating from Europe (on one hand) and from North America (on the other).<ref name=\"Kuo\"/>\n\nSome examples of varieties inside the main species are ''L. uvidus var. pallidus'' [[Giacomo Bresadola|Bres.]] (which is whitish), and ''L. uvidus var. candidulus'' Neuh. (which is small and pale and comes in muddy places).<ref name=\"Courtecuisse\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1746115}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lactarius uvidus}}\n[[Category:Lactarius|uvidus]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1789]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]"}]}}}}

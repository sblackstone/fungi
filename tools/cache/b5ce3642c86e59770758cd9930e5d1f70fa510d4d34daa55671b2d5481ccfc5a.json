'''''A. rubescens''''', found in Europe and eastern North America, and '''''A. novinupta''''' in western North America. Both their scientific and common names are derived from the propensity of their flesh to turn pink on bruising, or cutting.\n\nThe mushroom is edible and tasty, sought for in several European countries. Readily recognizable by its pinkish color on the bottom of the stem.\n\nIt is avoided by novice mushroomers as without knowledge it can be confused with deadly poisonous species.\n\n==Description==\nThe European blusher has a reddish-brown convex [[Pileus (mycology)|pileus]] (cap), that is up to 15&nbsp;cm across, and strewn with small cream-coloured warts. It is sometimes covered with an ochre-yellow flush which can be washed by the rain. The flesh of the mushroom is white, becoming pink when bruised or exposed to air. This is a key feature in differentiating it from the poisonous false blusher or panther cap ''([[Amanita pantherina]])'', whose flesh does not. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (stem) is white with flushes of the cap colour, and grows to a height of up to 15&nbsp;cm. The [[Gill (mushroom)|gills]] are white and free of the stem, and display red spots when damaged.\nThe ring is striate (i.e. has ridges) on its upper side, another feature distinguishing it from ''[[Amanita pantherina]]''.\nThe [[spore]]s are white, ovate, [[amyloid]], and approximately 8 by 5&nbsp;\u00b5m in size.\n\nThe [[flavour]] of the uncooked flesh is mild, but has a faint acrid [[aftertaste]]. The smell is not strong.\n\nThe mushroom is often attacked by insects.\n\n=== Distribution and habitat ===\nIt is common throughout much of [[Europe]] and eastern [[North America]], growing on poor soils as well as in [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] woodlands, appearing from June through to November in the UK. It has also been recorded from South Africa, where it is thought to have been accidentally introduced with trees imported from Europe.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Reid DA, Eicker A|year=1991|title=South African fungi: the genus ''Amanita''|journal=Mycological Research|volume=95|pages=80\u201395|format=PDF|url=http://www.msu.edu/user/hallenhe/SAJB%20amatoxin.pdf|accessdate=2007-11-13|doi=10.1016/S0953-7562(09)81364-6}}</ref>\n\nIn eastern North America, ''[[Amanita rubescens]]'' is frequently parasitized by ''[[Hypomyces hyalinus]]''.  Parasitized fruiting bodies are extremely difficult to recognize unless they occur in conjunction with healthy ones, although some retain the \"blushing\" characteristic of the species.<ref>Michael Kuo, [http://www.mushroomexpert.com/hypomyces_hyalinus.html Hypomyces hyalinus], [http://www.mushroomexpert.com/ MushroomExpert.com], Oct. 2003.</ref>\n\n==''Amanita novinupta''==\nA species found in the western U.S., only recently formally described and until then frequently misidentified as ''A. rubescens''; see [http://www.mykoweb.com MykoWeb] - [http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/index.html Fungi of California] - [http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Amanita_novinupta.html ''Amanita novinupta''] for details.\n\n==Other species==\nClosely related species include ''Amanita brunneolocularis'',  ''A. orsonii'', ''A. rubescens'' var.

European ''Amanita rubescens'' is known to contain a [[hemolytic]] protein in its raw state; it is unknown whether North American ''A. rubescens'' and ''A. novinupta'' are similarly toxic when eaten raw. This [[protein]] is destroyed by cooking, so it is important to cook this mushroom before eating.\n\n''Amanita novinupta'' is highly regarded as a choice edible in the region in which it is found. However, the edibility of blusher species other than ''A. rubescens'' and ''A. novinupta'' has not been established and experimentation is not advised.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Amanita.Amerirubescens.002.jpg| ''Amanita'' 'amerirubescens' <!--not a published name per Index Fungorum?-->\nFile:Amanita.Amerirubescens.001.jpg| ''Amanita'' 'amerirubescens' <!--not a published name per Index Fungorum?-->\nFile:Muchom\u016frka r\u016f\u017eov\u00e1 1.jpg|Mushrooms at various ages\nFile:Amanita rubescens 12.jpg|Amanita rubescens\nFile:Amanita rubescens var. anulo sulphureus.jpg|Amanita rubescens f. anulo sulphureus\nFile:Amanita rubescens100.jpg|Amanita rubescens\nFile:Amanita rubescens 333.jpg|Amanita rubescens \n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Amanita rubescens}}\n*[http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/key.dir/valirube.pdf \"Tabular and Nontabular Keys to the Rubescent Species of ''Amanita'' section ''Validae''\"] by Rodham E.

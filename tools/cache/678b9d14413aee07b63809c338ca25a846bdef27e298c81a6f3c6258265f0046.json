The [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Mycena]]'' was first [[species description|described]] scientifically in 1772, but was not considered a ''Mycena'' until 1821. It is quite variable in color, size, and shape, which makes it somewhat difficult to reliably identify in the field. The mushrooms have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] with distinct radial grooves, particularly at the margin. The cap's color varies from grayish brown to dark brown and the shape ranges from bell-like to bluntly conical to flattened with an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is hollow, white, tough and thin, without a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and often roots deeply into the wood on which it grows. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white to grayish or even pinkish when mature and are connected by distinct cross-veins. The caps can reach {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and have a mealy odor and taste. The [[spore print]] is white and the gills are pink at maturity, which can lead to possible confusion with species of the genus ''[[Pluteus]]''. ''M.&nbsp;galericulata'' mushrooms grow mostly in clusters on the well-decayed stumps of [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] trees from spring to autumn. The species can generally be considered [[edible mushroom|inedible]]. It is common and widespread in the entire [[temperate]] zone of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], but it has also been reported from Africa.\n\n==Taxonomy, classification, and naming==\nThe fungus was first [[species description|described]] scientifically as ''Agaricus galericulatus'' by Italian mycologist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] in 1772,<ref name=Scopoli1772/> and [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] under this name by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in his 1821 ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]''.<ref name=Fries1821/> That same year, [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] transferred the species to the genus ''[[Mycena]]''.<ref name=Gray1821/> [[Synonym (biology)|Synonyms]] for the species include ''Agaricus conicus'' named by [[William Hudson (botanist)|William Hudson]] in 1778, ''Agaricus crispus'' described by [[August Johann Georg Karl Batsch]] in 1893, ''Stereopodium galericulatum'' by [[Franklin Sumner Earle]] in 1909,<ref name=Earle1906/> and ''Prunulus galericulatus'' by [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1916.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena galericulata\"/>\n\n''Mycena galericulata'' is the [[type species]] of the genus ''Mycena''. It is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in [[section (biology)|section]] ''Mycena'' of ''Mycena'' in the infrageneric scheme of [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus]].<ref name=MaasGeesteranus1992/> In the older (1947) classification of [[Alexander H. Smith]], he placed it in the subgenus ''Eumycena'', section ''Typicae''\u2014\"a most monotonous series of blackish, brown, gray, bluish-gray, or brownish-gray species mostly with ascending gills and generally large to moderate stature.\"<ref>Smith (1947), [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/f/fung1tc/agk0806.0001.001/243?view=image&size=100 p. 225].</ref>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''galericulata'' is derived from the Latin ''galer'', and means \"with a small hat\".<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> Gray called it the \"helmetted high-stool\".<ref name=Gray1821/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"common bonnet\", the \"toque mycena\",<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> or the \"rosy-gill fairy helmet\".<ref name=McKnight1987/>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Mycena galericulata 63380.jpg\n| caption1 = The gills are interspersed with several tiers of lamellulae, and are strongly interveined.\n| image2 = Mycena galericulata 051106w.jpg\n| caption2 = The cap of this older specimen is flattened with splits at the margin; it has a broad umbo and radial striations.\n}}\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''M.&nbsp;galericulata'' is roughly conical when young, and eventually becomes broadly bell-shaped or with a broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] that can reach diameters of {{convert|2|-|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The cap margin is initially somewhat curved inward, but soon evens out or even becomes uplifted, and often splits radially in age. The surface has radial grooves that extend nearly to the center, and feels greasy but not sticky. The color is somewhat [[buff (color)|buff]]-brown on the margin, and fades gradually to pale dirty [[tan (color)|tan]] to dirty cinnamon-brown. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick in the center of the cap and tapers evenly to the margin, and is watery gray, with a cartilage-like texture. The odor and taste are mildly to strongly farinaceous (similar to the smell of freshly ground flour),<ref name=\"Smith p.347-51\"/> to radish-like.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gill]]s are narrowly attached ([[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]]) to broadly attached or sinuate. The gill spacing ranges from close to somewhat distantly spaced, with 26\u201336 gills reaching the stem; there are additionally three or four tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stem). The gills are strongly intervenose (possessing cross-veins), moderately broad (5\u20137&nbsp;mm), white or grayish white, soon flushed with pale pink, with even edges. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|5|-|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|2|-|4|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, equal in width throughout, and with a cartilaginous texture. It is hollow, not hairy, either smooth or twisted with longitudinal striations, often with a long [[pseudorrhiza]] (a subterranean elongation of the stem) at the base. The stem color is pale grayish white on the upper portion, and pale grayish black below; the base becomes somewhat dirty brown in age, but does not develop reddish stains.<ref name=\"Smith p.347-51\"/>\n\n''Mycena galericulata'' produces a white [[spore print]]. The [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], 8\u201310 by 5.5\u20137&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]], and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]\u2014which means they will turn blue-black to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) have stout [[sterigmata]], and measure 34\u201340 by 7\u20139&nbsp;\u03bcm. They may be either two-spored or four-spored. There are numerous club-shaped to rounded cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge), that measure 32\u201340 by 8\u201312&nbsp;\u03bcm; their apices or the entire enlarged portion bear rodlike projections that become increasingly elongated and branched in age. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue has a very thin cuticle, under which is a narrow hypoderm, while the remainder of the tissue comprises densely matted tufts of mycelia, and stains deep [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]-brown in iodine.<ref name=\"Smith p.347-51\"/> [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of the four-spored forms.<ref name=\"urlAronsen: Mycena galericulata\"/>\n\n===Edibility===\nOpinions on the [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom vary. One source considers them to have a \"delicate flavor and texture\", and suggests that they are good when \"stewed gently in their own juice and then seasoned with salt, pepper and butter.\"<ref name=Dickinson1982/> Others list the species as inedible,<ref name=Miller2006/><ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> and notes that they have a \"mildly rancid\" smell, and with a taste ranging from rancid to farinaceous.<ref name=Miller2006/> Another says \"unknown, but not recommended.\"<ref name=McKnight1987/> At any rate, the species falls into the general category of brownish Mycenas that are generally unappetizing as food due to their small size and delicate consistency.<ref name=McKnight1987/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Lookalikes ''[[Mycena inclinata|M.&nbsp;inclinata]]'' (left) and ''[[Mycena maculata|M.&nbsp;maculata]]'' (right) can often be distinguished from ''M.&nbsp;galericulata'' by the stains that develop on the gills as they mature.\n| align = right\n| image1 = Mycena inclinata 146384.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (200 * 3696 / 2772) round 0}}\n| image2 = Mycena maculata 60204.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (200 * 2592 / 3872) round 0}}\n}}\nThe winter bonnet (''[[Mycena tintinnabulum|M.&nbsp;tintinnabulum]]'') is a northern European species that is much smaller (cap diameter up to {{convert|2.6|cm|in|abbr=on}} across) and has a brown cap, and has ragged hairs at the base. It generally appears in late autumn to early winter on the stumps of deciduous trees, especially [[beech]].

It can also grow from submerged wood, which may give it a terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter.<ref name=Dickinson1982/> A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that ''M.&nbsp;galericulata'' produces extracellular [[hydrolytic enzyme]]s in the [[humus]] and [[eluvium|eluvial]] soil, including [[Glycoside hydrolases|\u03b2-glucosidase]], [[\u03b2-xylosidase]], [[\u03b1-glucosidase]], [[butyrate esterase]] and [[sulphatase]]. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) [[biopolymer]]s such as [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[starch]], which contributes to the [[carbon cycle|cycling]] of carbon and nutrients.<ref name=Kahkonen2011/> The presence of [[lead]] contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of ''M.&nbsp;galericulata''.<ref name=Kahkonen2008/>\n\n''Mycena galericulata'' is a very common and widely distributed species, found throughout the entire [[temperate]] zone of the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> In the United States, it occurs throughout eastern North America and also along the [[Pacific Coast]].<ref name=\"Smith p.347-51\"/> It has also been collected in [[Edo State]], Nigeria.<ref name=Idu2008/> Although the mushroom has occasionally been reported from Australia, these collections are probably based on misidentifications, and \"Australian records of ''Mycena galericulata'' are best regarded as erroneous\".<ref name=Grgurinovic2003/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |authorlink=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |pages=235\u20136 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Dickinson1982>{{cite book |title=VNR Color Dictionary of Mushrooms |vauthors=Dickinson C, Lucas J |year=1982 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-442-21998-7 |pages=119\u201320}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Earle1906>{{cite journal |title=The genera of North American gill fungi |journal=Bulletin of the New York Botanical Garden |author=Earle FS. |volume=5 |pages=373\u2013451 |year=1906}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Fries1821>{{cite book |title=Systema Mycologicum |author=Fries EM. |volume=1 |year=1821 |location=Lundin, Sweden |publisher=Ex Officina Berlingiana |page=143 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4338165 |language=Latin}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Gray1821>{{cite book |title=A Natural Arrangement of British Plants |volume=1 |author=Gray SF. |year=1821 |publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy |location=London, UK |page=619 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cN8UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA619}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Grgurinovic2003>{{cite book |author=Grgurinovic CA. |title=The Genus ''Mycena'' in South-eastern Australia |series=Fungal Diversity Progress Series No. 9 |year=2003 |publisher=Australian Biological Resources Study, Fungal Diversity Press |location=Hong Kong |page= |isbn=978-962-86765-2-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Idu2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Idu M, Osemwegie OO, Onyibe HI |title=Checklist of flora in Edo State, Nigeria |journal=Plant Archives |year=2008 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=539\u201349 |issn=0972-5210}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kahkonen2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen MA, Lankinen P, Hatakka A |title=Hydrolytic and ligninolytic enzyme activities in the Pb contaminated soil inoculated with litter-decomposing fungi |journal=Chemosphere |year=2008 |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=708\u201314 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.04.008 |pmid=18499227}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kahkonen2011>{{cite journal |vauthors=K\u00e4hk\u00f6nen MA, Hakulinen R |title=Hydrolytic enzyme activities, carbon dioxide production and the growth of litter degrading fungi in different soil layers in a coniferous forest in Northern Finland |journal=European Journal of Soil Biology |year=2011 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=108\u201313 |doi=10.1016/j.ejsobi.2010.12.004}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=MaasGeesteranus1992>{{cite book |author=Maas Geesteranus RA. |title=Mycenas of the Northern Hemisphere.

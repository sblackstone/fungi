Sometimes mistaken for a true morel (genus ''[[Morchella]]''), this species is a \"[[false morel]]\" characterized by a cap resembling a [[thimble]] that is freely attached to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].<ref name=\"urlVerpa conica (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first described under the name ''Phallus conicus'' by [[Otto Friedrich M\u00fcller]] in 1775. Later authors have moved the taxon to various genera: Persoon placed in ''[[Leotia]]'' in 1801, [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] transferred it ''Relhanum'' in 1821, while [[Otto Kuntze]] moved it to ''Monka'' in 1898. The species was transferred to ''[[Verpa]]'' by [[Olof Swartz]] in 1814.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank\"/>\n\n==Description==\nFruiting bodies have a smooth [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is bell-shaped or conical, and {{convert|1.5|to|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad;<ref name=\"urlVerpa conica (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/> it is attached to the top of the stem only, the margin of the cap is free &ndash; hanging like a skirt. The underside of the cap is [[tan (color)|tan]] to dark brown in color. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], which measures {{convert|5|to|11|cm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|1|to|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, is white and tapers upwards so that the apex is slightly thicker than the base; the stem surface is either smooth or slightly fuzzy.<ref name=Healy2008/> It is generally hollow, although young specimens may be filled with cotton-like [[hypha]]e. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and brittle, and the cap can be easily broken off the stem.\n\n[[David Arora]] notes that sometimes a variety with a wrinkled cap can be found, somewhat resembling a ''[[Gyromitra]]''.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n===Microscopic features===\n[[Spore]]s are elliptical, smooth, [[hyaline]], with dimensions of 28\u201334 by 15\u201319&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The [[Ascus|asci]] are typically 500\u2013550 by 21\u201327&nbsp;\u00b5m, and eight spored. The [[paraphyses]] are club-shaped, branched, and [[septate]].<ref name=Tylukti1979/>\n\n=== Differentiation from ''Morchella'' ===\nSince the cap is free in ''V. conica,'' it is easily distinguishable from true morels. True morels attach at the base of the cap. ''V. conica'' mushrooms attach at the top of the cap\u2014so they are even distinguishable from half-free morels. This mushroom also tends to be filled with a cotton material, whereas morels are hollow all of the way through.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThis species grows singly, scattered, or in groups on the ground in both [[hardwood]] and [[coniferous]] forests, often in river valleys, or along stream banks.<ref name=Tylukti1979/> It often fruits in late spring, usually near [[morel]] season. It has been reported to fruit abundantly in the [[chaparral]] [[scrubland]] in southern California.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Edibility==\nAlthough some authors claim the mushroom to be edible,<ref name=Jordan2004/><ref name=Weber1980/> others warn that it may cause gastrointestinal discomfort.<ref name=Hall2003/> It may be confused with the \"early morel\", species ''[[Verpa bohemica]]'', which is not recommended for consumption.<ref name=McKnight1978/>\n\n== Use as an Antioxidant ==\n[[File:Verpa conica free cap.jpg|thumb|The free hanging cap of ''V. conica.'']]\nThere is evidence that ''V. conica'' may contain compounds that function as an [[antioxidant]]. While not necessarily recommended for consumption, it is possible that an extract from ''V. conica'' could be used as an antioxidant supplement. A study done on the antioxidant activity of various mushroom species indicates that this species of ''Verpa'' does particularly well in reducing power. They also do well in binding iron, which may be related to peroxidation protection.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elmastas|first=Mahfuz|last2=Isildak|first2=Omer|last3=Turkekul|first3=Ibrahim|last4=Temur|first4=Nuri|year=2007|title=Determination of antioxidant activity and antioxidant compounds in wild edible mushrooms|url=|journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis|volume=20|pages=337\u2013345|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2006.07.003}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=795 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-RmabYsjI4C&pg=RA1-PA795}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hall2003>{{cite book |author=Hall IR. |title=Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms of the World |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2003 |page=113 |isbn=0-88192-586-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Healy2008>{{cite book |vauthors=Healy RA, Huffman DR, Tiffany LH, Knaphaus G |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of the Midcontinental United States |series=Bur Oak Guide |publisher=University of Iowa Press |location=Iowa City, Iowa |year=2008 |page=297 |isbn=1-58729-627-6}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Jordan2004>{{cite book |author=Jordan M. |title=The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London, UK |year=2004 |page=57 |isbn=0-7112-2379-3}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=McKnight1978>{{cite book |vauthors=McKnight VB, McKnight KH |title=A Field Guide to Mushrooms, North America |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Massachusetts |year=1987 |page=43 |isbn=0-395-91090-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSdA3V7Z9WcC&pg=PA43}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Tylukti1979>{{cite book |author=Tylutki EE. |title=Mushrooms of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest |publisher=University Press of Idaho |location=Moscow, Idaho |year=1979 |page=42 |isbn=0-89301-062-6}}</ref>\n\n <ref name=\"urlMycoBank\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=241570 |title=''Verpa conica'' (O.F.

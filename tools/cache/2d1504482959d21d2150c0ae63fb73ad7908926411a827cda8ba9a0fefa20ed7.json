It is a fairly common [[species]] on well-drained soils. It is found solitary or in groups and [[fairy ring]]s in [[pasture]]s and occasionally in woodland. Globally, it is widespread in [[temperate]] [[regions]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe fungus was first [[species description|described]] in 1772 by Italian naturalist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]], who named it ''Agaricus procerus''.<ref name=\"Scopoli 1772\"/> [[Rolf Singer]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Macrolepiota]]'' in 1948.<ref name=\"Singer 1948\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe height and cap diameter of a mature specimen may both reach 40&nbsp;cm, a size truly impressive for the fruiting body of an [[agaric]]. The [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]] is relatively thin and reaches full height before the cap has expanded. The stipe is very fibrous in texture which renders it inedible. The surface is characteristically wrapped in a [[Snake scales|snakeskin]]-like pattern of [[scale (zoology)|scaly]] growths (therefore, known in some parts of Europe as the \"snake's hat\" or \"snake's sponge\"). The immature cap is compact and [[egg-shaped]], with the cap margin around the stipe, sealing a chamber inside the cap. As it matures, the margin breaks off, leaving a fleshy, movable ring around the stipe. At full [[Sexual maturity|maturity]], the cap is more or less flat, with a chocolate-brown [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]] in the centre that is leathery to touch. Dark and cap-coloured flakes remain on the upper surface of the cap and can be removed easily. The [[gill (mushroom)|gill]]s are crowded, free, and white with a pale pink tinge sometimes present. The [[spore print]] is white. It has a pleasant [[nutty]] smell. When sliced, the white flesh may turn a pale pink.\n\n==Uses==\nIt is a very sought-after and popular fungus in Europe, due in part to its large size, seasonal frequency and versatility in the kitchen. In the UK, it may be found from July through to November.\n\nThe parasol mushroom is difficult to mistake for any other, especially in regions like Europe where the poisonous look-alike ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'' does not occur. Nevertheless, as with picking any fungus for consumption, caution should be exercised at all times.\n\nThe parasol mushroom may not be eaten raw, because it is slightly toxic.\n\nThese mushrooms are popularly sauteed in melted butter. In central and eastern European countries this mushroom is usually prepared similarly to a [[cutlet]]. It is usually run through egg and breadcrumbs and then fried in a pan with some oil or butter. Served with white bread, it makes a delicious meal during summer and early fall.<ref>[https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bossowski.pl%2Fprywatny-atlas-grzybow%2Fgrzyby-jadalne-te-co-sam-zbieram%2Fczubajka-kania%2F Parasol Mushroom - Private mushroom record of J\u00f3zef Bossowski]</ref> A savory Slovak recipe is to bake caps stuffed with ground pork, oregano, and garlic. Italians and Austrians also serve the young, still spherical caps stuffed with seasoned minced beef, baked in the same manner as stuffed peppers.\n\n==Similar species==\n[[File:Parasol-1.jpg|thumb|200px|left| Macrolepiota procera, the parasol mushroom]]\n\nSmaller but similar in appearance is the common [[shaggy parasol]] (''Chlorophyllum rhacodes''.) Its edibility is suspect as it causes mild sickness in some people, especially when eaten raw. One must learn to distinguish the two as their geographical ranges overlap.\n\nDifferences from the parasol mushroom include its smaller dimensions, pungent (fruity) and reddening flesh when cut, lack of patterns on its stipe, and very shaggy cap surface.\n\n''[[Macrolepiota mastoidea]]'', a European species, is yet another very large edible mushroom. Its dimensions are generally smaller than that of ''M. procera'' and the markings on its stipe less obvious. It is also much rarer.\n\nSpecies of ''[[Agaricus]]'' have brown spores and the gills of mature specimens are never white.\n\nThere are a few poisonous species which can be mistaken for ''M. procera''. \n*''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'', a species that causes the largest number of annual mushroom poisonings in [[North America]] due to its close similarity. Faintly green gills and a pale green spore print give it away. Furthermore, this mushroom lacks the aforementioned snakeskin pattern that is generally present on the parasol mushroom.<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214040731/http://www.alanmuskat.com:80/articles/parasol2.htm |date=14 December 2017 |title=How to not pass up a parasol and how not to}}</ref> Its range is reportedly expanding into Europe.<ref>[http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/mycology/1996-September/004542.html Macrolepiota rhacodes and Chlorophyllum molybdites poisoning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*''[[Leucocoprinus brunnea]]'', also found in North America, slowly turns brown when sliced.\n*White and immature species of ''[[Amanita]]'' are also a potential hazard. To be sure, one must only pick parasol mushrooms past their button stage. A general [[rule of thumb]] with the parasol mushroom as compared to amanita species is that the parasol mushroom has darker flakes on a lighter surface, whereas amanita species have the opposite, lighter flakes (if there are any) on a darker surface, such as the [[Amanita pantherina|Panther cap]].\n*The '''Saffron Parasol''' ''[[Cystoderma amianthinum]]'' is very much smaller, and not often eaten.\n*''[[Lepiota brunneoincarnata]]'' is a lepiota species known to have caused mortal intoxications in Spain. It is much smaller than ''Macrolepiota procera''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Glawlen y Bwgan (Macrolepiota procera).jpg\nFile:Macrolepiota-procera.jpg\nFile:Macrolepiota_procera_fungus,_Woodfidley,_New_Forest_-_geograph.org.uk_-_261237.jpg\nFile:Macrolepiota procera 2011 G1.jpg\nFile:Parasol-Macrolepiota-procera.jpg\nFile: Fungo - Mazza di Tamburo.jpg\nFile:Parasol mushroom.jpg\nFile:Breaded parasol mushroom.jpg|A breaded parasol mushroom\nFile:Unopened parasol mushroom.jpg\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|1|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Scopoli 1772\">{{cite book |author=Scopoli JA. |title=Flora carniolica |year=1772 |volume=2 |edition=2 |location=Vienna |publisher=K.P.&nbsp;Krause |page=441 |language=Latin}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Singer 1948\">{{cite journal |author=Singer R. |title=New and interesting species of Basidiomycetes.

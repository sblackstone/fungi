It produces a medium-sized [[mushroom]] with a grayish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, gray-violet [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] and a whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] with pale yellow belts below. The mushroom grows solitarily or in scattered groups on the ground in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous forest]]s. It is found throughout the [[temperate]] zone of the [[northern hemisphere]].\n\n==Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming==\nThe species was first described as ''Agaricus anomalus'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1818.<ref name=\"Fries 1818\"/> Fries later transferred it to the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'' in 1838 in his ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici''.<ref name=\"Fries 1838\"/> [[Friedrich Otto W\u00fcnsche]] placed it in ''[[Dermocybe]]'' as ''Dermocybe anomala''.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Dermocybe anomala\"/>\n\n[[Phylogenetic]] analysis suggests that ''Cortinarius anomalus'' is closely related to ''[[Cortinarius collinitus]]'', ''[[Cortinarius violaceus]]'', and ''[[Cortinarius odorifer]]''.<ref name=\"Peintner 2001\"/>\n\nThe fungus is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"variable webcap\".<ref name=\"English Common Names\"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''anomalus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word for \"paradoxical\".<ref name=\"Evenson 1997\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}}, initially almost spherical, then expanded convex and finally flattened. The cap has a broad, blunt and low [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], which frequently lies in a depression since the margin which is initially rolled inward, then straight, often becomes turned upward. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is dry and difficult to peel. The cap surface is dry or humid, non-shiny in the center, but shiny towards the margin which is covered with fibrils when young. The cap is almost uniformly colored dirty rusty-brown or ashy-brown to grayish-tan, sometimes slightly paler towards the margin, with or without a faint grayish-violet tinge when young.<ref name=\"Pilat 1961\"/>\n[[image:Cortinarius.anomalus2.-.lindsey.jpg|thumb|left|Gills]]\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are moderately crowded, about {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide when mature, thin, and whitish-blue, grayish-blue or pale [[lilac (color)|lilac]] when young. As the mushroom matures, the gill color rapidly fades and soon becomes brown, then a rusty-clay color, without any trace of the blue characteristic of young specimens. The gill attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is adnate (fused to the stem) and emarginate (notched). The edge of the gills is pale, and the edge ranges from finely denticulate (with a very finely toothed margin) to straight.<ref name=\"Pilat 1961\"/>\n\nThe stem is {{convert|6|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.5|\u2013|0.8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical above, slightly club-shaped below, and usually somewhat curved. It is initially very fibrillose, later silvery shiny and wavy, violet or grayish violet at the apex when young, more gray or grayish-brown at the base. The violet coloring soon disappears and then the stem is whitish or pale clay brownish and silkily fibrillose. Beneath the cap there is a golden yellow ring-like region. On the rest of the stem there are sometimes remnants of the [[partial veil]] as yellowish-saffron hairy tufts, which form incomplete rings or scattered minute scales. The cortina (a cobweb-like partial veil consisting of silky fibrils) is thick, whitish, and lasts only a short time.<ref name=\"Pilat 1961\"/>\n\nThe [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] in the cap is thin, rarely thicker than {{convert|0.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}, whitish to pale violet or pale lilac in the upper part of the stem when young, but soon fading, grayish-white in the lower part of the stem. Its smell is faintly fruity, and its taste mild. It is an [[edible mushroom]] but insubstantial.<ref name=\"Pilat 1961\"/>\n\nThe [[spore print|spore deposit]] is rusty-brown. The [[spore]]s are spherical to egg-shaped, with a distinct apiculus (the part of a spore which attaches to the [[sterigmata]] at the end of a basidium), finely verrucose, 5.7\u20139 by 7\u20138.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 30\u201340 by 8\u20139&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=\"Pilat 1961\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Cortinarius alboviolaceus]]'' is silvery-white to gray-violet when young and has a thick, white fibrillose veil, a bulkier stem, and elliptical spores.<ref name=\"Evenson 1997\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Cortinarius anomalus'' is a common species in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]], [[mixed forest|mixed]], or more rarely [[coniferous forest|coniferous woods]]. The fruit bodies appear late in the summer and autumn throughout the [[temperate]] zone of the [[northern hemisphere]].<ref name=\"Pilat 1961\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Cortinarius species|List of ''Cortinarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"English Common Names\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/ENGLISH_NAMES.pdf |title=Recommended English Names for Fungi in the UK |format=PDF |publisher=[[British Mycological Society]] |access-date=2012-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716083053/http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/ENGLISH_NAMES.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Evenson 1997\">{{cite book |title=Mushrooms of Colorado and the Southern Rocky Mountains |author=Evenson VS |year=1997 |publisher=Westcliffe Publishers |isbn=978-1-56579-192-3 |page=120 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAeDeyqZLq0C&lpg=PA120&dq=Cortinarius%20anomalus&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q=Cortinarius%20anomalus&f=false |accessdate=2010-08-01}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Fries 1818\">{{cite book |title=Observationes mycologicae |volume=2 |author=Fries EM |year=1818 |publisher= |page=73 |url= |accessdate= |language=Latin}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Fries 1838\">{{cite book |title=Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici |author=Fries EM |year=1838 |publisher= |page=286 |url= |accessdate= |language=Latin}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Peintner 2001\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Peinterber U, Bougher NL, Castellano MA, Moncalvo JM, Moser MM, Trappe JM, Vilgalys R |year=2001 |title=Multiple origins of sequestrate fungi related to ''Cortinarius'' (Cortinariaceae) |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=88 |issue=12 |pages=2168\u201379 |jstor=3558378 |pmid=21669649 |doi=10.2307/3558378}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Pilat 1961\">{{cite book |title=Mushrooms and other Fungi |vauthors=Pilat \u00c1, U\u0161\u00e1k O |year=1961 |publisher=Peter Nevill |location=London |page=113}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Cortinarius anomalus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=209878 |title=''Cortinarius anomalus'' (Fr.)

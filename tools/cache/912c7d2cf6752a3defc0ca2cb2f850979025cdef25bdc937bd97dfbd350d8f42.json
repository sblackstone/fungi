Some guidebooks refer to it by its older scientific names of ''Entoloma lividum'' or ''Rhodophyllus sinuatus''. The largest mushroom of the [[genus]] of pink-[[spore]]d fungi known as ''[[Entoloma]]'', it is also the [[type species]].  Appearing in late summer and autumn, [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are found in [[deciduous forest|deciduous woodlands]] on clay or chalky soils, or nearby parklands, sometimes in the form of [[fairy ring]]s. Solid in shape, they resemble members of the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]''. The ivory to light grey-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is up to 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) across with a margin that is rolled inward. The sinuate [[gill (mushroom)|gill]]s are pale and often yellowish, becoming pink as the [[spore]]s develop. The thick whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] has no [[annulus (mycology)|ring]].\n\nWhen young, it may be mistaken for the [[edible mushroom|edible]] St George's mushroom (''[[Calocybe gambosa]]'') or the miller (''[[Clitopilus prunulus]]''). It has been responsible for many cases of [[mushroom poisoning]] in Europe. ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'' causes primarily [[gastrointestinal problem]]s that, though not generally life-threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon [[sequela]]e. It is generally not considered to be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.\n\n== Name and relationships ==\n[[File:Entoloma sinuatum by Bulliard 1788 plate 382.jpg|thumb|left|Bulliard's original illustration of ''Agaricus lividus'' from his 1788 ''Champignon de la France'', which has been found to be a depiction of ''[[Pluteus cervinus]]''.<ref name=Redeuilh1999/>|alt=an old line drawing of the various parts of a mushroom fruit body]]\nThe saga of this species' name begins in 1788 with the publication of part 8 of [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Jean Baptiste Bulliard]]'s ''Herbier de la France''. In it was plate 382, representing a mushroom which he called ''[[Agaricus]] lividus''.<ref name=Bulliard1788/> In 1872, [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] took up a species which he called \"''[[Entoloma]] lividus'' Bull.\";<ref name=Quelet1872/><ref name=Redeuilh1995/> although all subsequent agree that this is a fairly clear reference to Bulliard's name, Qu\u00e9let gave a description that is generally considered to be that of a different species from Bulliard's.<ref name=Redeuilh1999/><ref name=Redeuilh1995/> In the meantime, 1801 had seen the description of ''Agaricus sinuatus'' by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon|Christian Persoon]] in his ''[[Synopsis Methodica Fungorum]]''.<ref name=Persoon1801/> He based that name on another plate (number 579) published in the last part of Bulliard's work, and which the latter had labelled \"agaric sinu\u00e9\".<ref group=note>Which means that under the modern principles of nomenclature, Persoon, not Bulliard, is the first to have used the name, since only names in Latin can be considered.</ref> German mycologist [[Paul Kummer]] reclassified it as ''Entoloma sinuatum'' in 1871.<ref name=Kummer1871/>\n\nFor many years Qu\u00e9let's name and description were treated as valid because Bulliard's name antedated Persoon's. However, in 1950, a change in the ''[[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]'' (termed the Stockholm Code, after the city where the International Botanical Congress was being held) caused only names on fungi published after 1801 or 1821 (depending on their type) to be valid.<ref name=Korf1982/> This meant that suddenly Bulliard's name was no longer a valid name, and now it was Persoon's name that had priority. Nonetheless it was a well-known name, and the already chaotic situation caused by a change to a famous Latin name was further complicated by another of Qu\u00e9let's suggestions. He had in 1886 proposed a new, broader genus that included all pink-gilled fungi with [[Lamella (mycology)#Classification|adnate or sinuate gills]] and angular spores: ''Rhodophyllus''.<ref name=Quelet1886/> These two approach to genus placement, using either ''Rhodophyllus'' or ''Entoloma'', coexisted for many decades, with mycologists and guidebooks following either;<ref name=Singer1975/> [[Henri Romagnesi]], who studied the genus for over forty years, favoured ''Rhodophyllus'', as initially did [[Rolf Singer]].<ref name=Singer1975/> However, most other authorities have tended to favor ''Entoloma'',<ref name=Noordeloos1992/> and Singer conceded the name was far more widely used and adopted it for his ''Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'' text in 1986.<ref name=Singer1986/>\n\nIn the meantime, it had been widely accepted that the 1950 change to the Stockholm Code caused more problems than they solved, and in 1981, the Sydney Code reinstated the validity of pre-1801 names, but created the status of [[sanctioned name]] for those used in the foundational works of Persoon and [[Elias Magnus Fries]].<ref name=Korf1982/> Thus ''Entoloma sinuatum'', which Fries had sanctioned,<ref name=Fries1821/> still had to be used for the species described by Qu\u00e9let even though Bulliard's name was the older one. At about the same time, [[Machiel Noordeloos]] re-examined Bulliard's name in more details, and discovered that not only was it [[Illegitimate name|illegitimate]] (and thus not available for use) because [[William Hudson (botanist)|William Hudson]] had already used it ten years earlier for a different species, but Bulliard's illustration was clearly not an ''Entoloma'', but a species of ''[[Pluteus]]'',<ref group=note>It is now generally accepted the species in question is ''[[Pluteus cervinus]]''.</ref> a genus that is only distantly related to ''Entoloma''.<ref name=Redeuilh1995/> As this made Qu\u00e9let's name definitely unusable for the ''Entoloma'', and because at the time he and Romagnesi<ref name=romagnesi1978/> believed there were ground to treat Qu\u00e9let's \"''E. lividum''\" and Persoon's ''E. sinuatum'' as separate species, he had to coin a third name for Qu\u00e9let's species: ''Entoloma eulividum''.<ref name=Redeuilh1995/><ref name=Noordeloos1985/> He however later changed his mind on this issue, combining again his own ''Entoloma eulividum'' and ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'', so that Persoon's name is now universally recognised.<ref name=Noordeloos1992/><ref name=Breitenbach1991/> Because it was previously widely used and Qu\u00e9let had provided a good description and illustration (which, the proposer argued, was better considered as a new species rather than a mere placement of Bulliard's name in another genus),<ref name=Redeuilh1995/> a proposal was made in 1999 to [[Conserved name|conserve]] ''Entoloma lividum'' and thus restore its use.<ref name=Redeuilh1999/> However, it failed because ''E. sinuatum'' had already been in use (if not universally) for many years and was thus a well-known name for the species.<ref name=Gams2001/>\n\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n| clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n| label1=\n| 1={{clade\n     |1={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n           |1={{clade\n              |1={{clade\n                 |1='''''E. sinuatum'''''\n                 |2=''E.'' sp. 1{{refn|Initially presumed to be ''[[Entoloma prunuloides]]'' but later found to be distinct from that taxon.<ref name=Codavid2009/>|group=note|name=sp1}}\n                 }}\n              |2=''[[Entoloma sordidulum|E. sordidulum]]''\n              }}\n           |2={{clade\n              |1=''[[Entoloma politum|E. politum]]''\n              |2=''[[Entoloma rhodopolium|E. rhodopolium]]''\n              }}\n           }}\n        |2=''[[Entoloma caccabus|E. caccabus]]''\n        }}\n     |2={{clade\n        |1=''[[Entoloma sericatum|E. sericatum]]''\n        |2=''[[Entoloma myrmecophilum|E. myrmecophilum]]''\n        }}\n     }}\n}}\n| caption=[[Cladogram]] showing the [[phylogenetic]] relationships of ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'' and closely related fungi in the Rhodopolioid clade.<ref name=Codavid2009/>\n}}\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''sinuatum'' is the [[Latin]] for \"wavy\", referring to the shape of the cap, while the generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''entos/\u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2'' \"inner\" and ''l\u00f3ma/\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1'' \"fringe\" or \"hem\" from the inrolled margin.<ref name=Nilson1977/> The specific epithet ''lividum'' was derived from the Latin word ''l\u012bv\u01d0dus'' \"lead-coloured\".<ref name=Simpson1979/> The various [[common name]]s include livid entoloma, livid agaric, livid pinkgill, leaden entoloma, lead poisoner,<ref name=Foster1994/> and grey pinkgill.<ref name=McKnight1987/> In the [[Dijon]] region of France it was known as ''le grand empoisonneur de la [[C\u00f4te-d'Or]]'' (\"the great poisoner of ''C\u00f4te d'Or''\").<ref name=Ramsbottom1953/> Qu\u00e9let himself, who was poisoned by the fungus, called it ''the miller's purge'', akin to another common name of false miller.<ref name=Lamaison05/>\n\nWithin the large genus ''Entoloma'', which contains around 1500 species, ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'' has been classically placed in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Entoloma'' within the [[subgenus]] ''Entoloma'',<ref>Noordeloos, ''Fungi Europaei'', p. 72.</ref> as it is the [[type species]] of the genus.<ref name=Singer1986/> A 2009 study analyzing [[DNA sequence]]s and spore [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] found it to lie in a rhodopolioid [[clade]] with (among other species) ''[[Entoloma sordidulum|E.&nbsp;sordidulum]]'', ''[[Entoloma politum|E.&nbsp;politum]]'' and ''[[Entoloma rhodopolium|E.&nbsp;rhodopolium]]'', and most closely related to ''E.''&nbsp;sp.&nbsp;1.<ref group=note name=sp1/> This rhodopolioid clade lay within a crown ''Entoloma'' clade.<ref name=Codavid2009/><!-- cites para apart from note -->\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Entoloma sinuatum 40542.jpg|thumb|left|The gills of mature mushrooms darken to pink and then red.|alt=A whitish mushroom with pink gills occupies the foreground of a photo taken at ground level.

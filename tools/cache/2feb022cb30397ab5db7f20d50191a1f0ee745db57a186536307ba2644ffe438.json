The mushroom is commonly known among English speakers as '''hen of the woods''', '''hen-of-the-woods''', '''ram's head''' and '''sheep's head'''.  It is typically found in late summer to early autumn. In the United States' [[Dietary supplement|supplement]] market, as well as in [[Asian grocery store]]s, the mushroom is known by its Japanese name '''''maitake''''' (\u821e\u8338, \"dancing mushroom\"). Throughout [[Italian American]] communities in the northeastern United States, it is commonly known as the '''signorina''' mushroom.\n''G.&nbsp;frondosa'' should not be confused with ''Laetiporus sulphureus'', another edible [[bracket fungus]] that is commonly called [[chicken of the woods]] or \"sulphur shelf\". Like all polypores, the fungus becomes inedible when older, because it is then too tough to eat.\n\nThe fungus is native to China,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Jim Meuninck - Basic Illustrated Edible and Medicinal Mushrooms, pp. 13-14, Rowman & Littlefield, 1 Jun 2015 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ldXRCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|accessdate = 27 April 2017|isbn = 9781493014682|last1 = Meuninck|first1 = Jim|date = 2015-06-01}}</ref> the northeastern part of [[Japan]] and North America, and is prized in traditional [[Chinese herbology|Chinese and Japanese herbology]] as a [[medicinal mushroom]]. It is widely eaten in Japan, and its popularity in western cuisine is growing, although the mushroom has been reported to cause [[allergic reaction]]s in rare cases.\n\n{{mycomorphbox \n| name = Grifola frondosa\n| whichGills = decurrent\n| capShape = offset\n| capShape2 = no\n| hymeniumType=pores\n| stipeCharacter=NA\n| ecologicalType=parasitic\n| sporePrintColor=white\n| howEdible=choice}}\n\n==Description==\nLike the [[sulphur shelf]] mushroom, ''G. frondosa'' is a [[perennial]] [[fungus]] that often grows in the same place for a number of years in succession. It occurs most prolifically in the northeastern regions of the [[United States]], but has been found as far west as [[Idaho]].\n\n''G. frondosa''  grows from an underground [[tuber]]-like structure known as a [[sclerotium]], about the size of a [[potato]]. The fruiting body, occurring as large as 100&nbsp;cm, is a cluster consisting of multiple grayish-brown [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]]s which are often curled or spoon-shaped, with wavy margins and 2\u20137&nbsp;cm broad. The undersurface of each cap bears about one to three pores per millimeter, with the tubes rarely deeper than 3&nbsp;mm. The milky-white [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (stalk) has a branchy structure and becomes tough as the mushroom matures.\n\nIn Japan, the ''maitake'' can grow to more than {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, earning this giant mushroom the title \"king of mushrooms\".  Maitake is one of the major culinary mushrooms used in Japan, the others being ''[[shiitake]], [[shimeji]]'', and ''[[enoki]]''. They are used in a wide variety of dishes, often being a key ingredient in ''[[nabemono]]'' or cooked in foil with butter.\n\n==Medical research and use==\nIn 2009, a phase I/II human trial, conducted by [[Memorial Sloan\u2013Kettering Cancer Center]], showed ''maitake'' could stimulate the immune systems of breast cancer patients.<ref name=\"PMD19253021\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Deng G, Lin H, Seidman A, etal |title=A phase I/II trial of a polysaccharide extract from Grifola frondosa (Maitake mushroom) in breast cancer patients: immunological effects |journal=Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology |volume=135 |issue=9 |pages=1215\u201321 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19253021 |pmc=3751581 |doi=10.1007/s00432-009-0562-z}}</ref>{{psi|date=December 2017}} Small experiments with human cancer patients have shown it can stimulate immune system cells, such as [[NK cells]].<ref name=\"pmid14977447\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kodama N, Komuta K, Nanba H |title=Effect of Maitake (Grifola frondosa) D-Fraction on the activation of NK cells in cancer patients |journal=Journal of Medicinal Food |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=371\u20137 |year=2003 |pmid=14977447 |doi=10.1089/109662003772519949}}</ref>{{psi|date=December 2017}}<ref name=\"pmid12499658\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kodama N, Komuta K, Sakai N, Nanba H |title=Effects of D-Fraction, a polysaccharide from Grifola frondosa on tumor growth involve activation of NK cells |journal=Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=1647\u201350 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12499658 |doi=10.1248/bpb.25.1647}}</ref> ''[[In vitro]]'' research has also shown ''G. frondosa'' can stimulate immune system cells.<ref name=\"pmid15706424\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kodama N, Asakawa A, Inui A, Masuda Y, Nanba H |title=Enhancement of cytotoxicity of NK cells by D-Fraction, a polysaccharide from Grifola frondosa |journal=Oncology Reports |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=497\u2013502 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15706424 |doi=10.3892/or.13.3.497}}</ref>  An ''[[in vivo]]'' experiment showed that it could stimulate both the [[innate immune system]] and [[adaptive immune system]].<ref name=\"pmid15298759\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kodama N, Murata Y, Nanba H |title=Administration of a polysaccharide from Grifola frondosa stimulates immune function of normal mice |journal=Journal of Medicinal Food |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=141\u20135 |year=2004 |pmid=15298759 |doi=10.1089/1096620041224012}}</ref>\n\n''In vitro'' research has shown ''maitake'' can induce [[apoptosis]] in various cancer cell lines, and inhibit the growth of various types of cancer cells.<ref name=\"Ulbricht 2009\"/> Small studies with human cancer patients revealed that a portion of this mushroom, known as the ''mitake'' D-fraction, possesses anticancer activity.<ref name=\"pmid12126464\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kodama N, Komuta K, Nanba H |title=Can maitake MD-fraction aid cancer patients?

The fungus is distributed in the eastern United States, south to [[Florida]], and reaches north into the southeastern provinces of Canada. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] is medium-sized, {{convert|5|to|8.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter and white. It sits atop a [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] that is {{convert|8.5|to|16|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long and has a rounded bulb at its base. The entire fruit body will slowly stain a reddish-brown color in response to bruising or aging. It remains unknown whether ''Amanita aestivalis'' is a distinct species from ''[[Amanita brunnescens|A.&nbsp;brunnescens]]'', another similar ''[[Amanita]]'' with a comparable distribution. There are several other white-bodied amanitas with which ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' may be confused, including ''[[Amanita virosa|A.&nbsp;virosa]]'', ''[[Amanita phalloides|A.&nbsp;phalloides]]'', and ''[[Amanita bisporigera|A.&nbsp;bisporigera]]''.\n\n== Taxonomy, classification, and naming ==\nAmerican mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] first described the species in 1949 based on specimens he had collected in [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"Singer1949\" /> Because this original report was published without a [[Latin]] description (contrary to the naming conventions of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]), he later amended his description in 1959.<ref name=\"Singer1959\" /> There is some doubt as to whether ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' is a distinct species from ''[[Amanita brunnescens|A.&nbsp;brunnescens]]'' (the \"brown American star-footed Amanita\"), as described by [[George F. Atkinson]] in 1918.<ref name=\"A. brunnescens@Amanita Studies\" /> Singer claimed that the latter species could be distinguished from the former by the consistent absence of dusky brownish-gray radial stripes on the cap. However, in 1927, mycologist [[Louis Charles Christopher Krieger]] described the variant ''A.&nbsp;brunnescens'' var. ''pallida'', which he said was identical to ''A.&nbsp;brunnescens'' except for the white or very pale cap.<ref name=\"A. brunnescens@Amanita Studies\" /> In his 1986 [[monograph]] on North American species of ''Amanita'', David T. Jenkins preferred to reserve judgment on the matter.<ref name=\"Jenkins1986\" />\n\n''Amanita aestivalis'' is [[biological classification|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Vallidae'' of the genus ''Amanita'', a grouping of amanitas characterized by having spherical spores, well-developed [[annulus (mycology)|rings]], weakly reddening flesh, and \"limbate\" volvals (with narrow \"limbs\" protruding from a soft, margined bulb).<ref name=\"Singer1986\" />\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] adjective ''aestivalis'', meaning \"pertaining to the summer\".<ref name=\"Stearn2004\" /><ref name=\"Eggli Newton 2004\" /> Its [[common name|vernacular name]] is the \"white American star-footed Amanita\".<ref name=\"A. aestivalis@Amanita Studies\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Amanita aestivalis 51467.jpg|thumb|180px|left|When moist, the cap surface is sticky. The [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] is found on the upper part of the stem.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] is {{convert|5|to|8.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, and depending on its age, may range from egg-shaped to convex to somewhat flattened. Older specimens may have edges that are curved upwards. The color is white or pale tan in the center of the cap; older specimens may have areas of discolored tissue colored brownish-red shades. Sometimes, the edge of the cap has radial grooves\u2014up to {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} long\u2014that mirror the position of the underlying [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]].<ref name=\"Singer1959\" /> When moist, the cap is sticky to the touch; when dry, it is shiny, usually without any remnants of the thin volva. The white gills are crowded close together, and are free from attachment to the stem. They are ''subventricose'': slightly swollen in the middle, and tapering near the ends.<ref name=\"Jenkins1986\" />\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|8.5|to|16|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long by {{convert|0.9|to|1.6|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} thick, and slightly thicker at the base than at the top. It is stuffed with whitish [[hypha]]e that resemble cotton. The surface of the stem is smooth or has delicate tufts of soft, white, woolly hairs. There is a rimmed bulb at the base of the stem, which can reach a diameter of over {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on|1}}.<ref name=\"Singer1959\" /> The [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]\u2014located on the upper portion of the stem, {{convert|1.2|-|1.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} from the top<ref name=\"Singer1959\" />\u2014is white, membranous, and long-lasting. The [[volva (mycology)|volva]] remains closely attached to the bulb, although a portion may stretch out like a thin membrane and adhere to the base of the stem before collapsing. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] will slowly turn pinkish-brown to chocolate-brown when it has been injured or bruised.<ref name=\"Jenkins1986\" /> Young specimens do not have any distinct odor, but fruit bodies may smell slightly of onions or garlic in age.<ref name=\"Singer1959\" />\n\nAlthough the [[edible mushroom|edibility]] has not been documented for this species, some sources have noted that toxicity is suspected.<ref name=\"Jenkins1986\" /><ref name=\"Gibbons1990\" />\n\n=== Microscopic characteristics ===\nViewed in deposit, like with a [[spore print]], the [[basidiospores]] of ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' are white. Examination with a microscope reveals further details: they are roughly spherical, [[hyaline]] (translucent) and thin-walled, with dimensions of 7.8\u20138.8&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The spores are [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning that they will absorb [[iodine]] when stained with [[Melzer's reagent]] and appear blue to blackish-blue. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 32\u201360 long by 4\u201313&nbsp;\u03bcm thick.<ref name=\"Jenkins1986\" /> There are no clamps present at the bases of the basidia.<ref name=\"A. aestivalis@Amanita Studies\" />\n\n=== Similar species ===\n[[File:Amanita brunnescens 89292.jpg|150px|thumb|''A. brunnescens]]\nAccording to Singer, the species is often mistaken for ''[[Amanita verna|A.&nbsp;verna]]'' in the eastern United States. ''A.&nbsp;verna'', however, has ellipsoid spores. Other white amanitas within the range of ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' include the deadly toxic species ''[[Amanita virosa|A.&nbsp;virosa]]'' (has a more loose cottony stem), ''[[Amanita phalloides|A.&nbsp;phalloides]]'' (the cap usually has an olive-green tint) and ''[[Amanita bisporigera|A.&nbsp;bisporigera]]'' (typically has two-spored basidia). ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' is sometimes considered a white form of ''[[Amanita brunnescens|A.&nbsp;brunnescens]]'', but this latter species has dusky brownish gray radial stripes and usually has many fibrils (short section of [[hypha]]e) projecting from the surface, to produce a fine, hairy appearance. Further, it stains more rapidly than ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis''.<ref name=\"Singer1959\" /> ''[[Amanita asteropus|A.&nbsp;asteropus]]'' (the \"European star-footed Amanita\") is cream to yellow color, and differs from ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' in its reaction to [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical tests]]. It is only known from Europe.<ref name=\"A. asteropus@Amanita Studies\" />\n\n== Habitat, distribution, and ecology ==\n''Amanita aestivalis'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species,<ref name=\"Hu1980\" /> meaning it forms a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship in which the [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] [[hypha]]e of the fungus grow around and enclose the tiny roots of trees and shrubs. In this way, the plant is better able to absorb [[phosphorus]] and other soil nutrients, while the fungus receives moisture, protection, and nutritive byproducts of the plant's metabolism.<ref name=\"Alexopolous1996\" /> Fruit bodies of the fungus grow on the ground in [[temperate deciduous forest|deciduous]], [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]], and [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]]. A preference has been noted for oak woods containing ''[[Tsuga]]'' or ''[[Pinus]]'' species, as well as beech wood with ''[[Picea]]'', ''[[Abies]]'', and ''[[Betula]]''. Fruit bodies typically appear from late June until autumn. In North America, it has been found in the states of [[New England]], as well as [[Alabama]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"Singer1959\" /><ref name=\"Jenkins1986\" /> The distribution extends north to the southeastern provinces of Canada<ref name=\"A. aestivalis@Amanita Studies\" /> and south to [[Florida]].<ref name=\"Singer1959\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n* [[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"A. aestivalis@Amanita Studies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+aestivalis |title=''Amanita aestivalis'' |author=Tulloss R |work=Studies in the Amanitaceae |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"A. asteropus@Amanita Studies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+asteropus |title=''Amanita asteropus'' |author=Tulloss R |work=Studies in the Amanitaceae |accessdate=2010-07-07}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"A. brunnescens@Amanita Studies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+brunnescens |title=''Amanita brunnescens'' |author=Tulloss R |work=Studies in the Amanitaceae |accessdate=2010-07-07}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Alexopolous1996\">{{cite book |vauthors=Alexopoulos CJ, Mims CW, Blackwell M |title=Introductory Mycology |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=515\u201317 |isbn=0-471-52229-5}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Eggli Newton 2004\">{{cite book |last=Eggli |first=Urs |last2=Newton |first2=Leonard E. |title=Etymological Dictionary of Succulent Plant Names |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Heidelberg |year=2004 |isbn=978-3-540-00489-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2n5vusQ1DEC&pg=PA4 |access-date=12 November 2018 |page=4}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gibbons1990\">{{cite book |vauthors=Thomas JL, Gibbons W, Haynes RH |title=Poisonous Plants and Venomous Animals of Alabama and Adjoining States |publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=1990 |page=30 |isbn=0-8173-0442-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIvLteYdVqQC&lpg=PA30&dq=Amanita%20aestivalis&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q=Amanita%20aestivalis&f=false |accessdate=2010-07-07}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Hu1980\">{{cite journal |author=Hu HT. |year=1980 |title=Mycorrhizae of White Fir ''Abies alba'' in German Black Forest West Germany |journal=National Science Council Monthly |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=201\u201325 |issn=0250-1651}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Jenkins1986\">{{cite book |author=Jenkins DB. |title=''Amanita'' of North America |publisher=Mad River Press |location=Eureka, California |year=1986 |page=150 |isbn=0-916422-55-0}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Singer1949\">{{cite journal |author=Singer R. |year=1949 |title=The Agaricales in modern taxonomy |journal=Lilloa |volume=22 |edition=2nd |page=387}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Singer1959\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3756058 |author=Singer R. |year=1959 |title=New and interesting species of Basidiomycetes .6 |jstor=3756058 |journal=[[Mycologia]] |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013400}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Singer1986\">{{cite book |author=Singer R. |title=The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy |edition=4th |publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books |location=Koenigstein |year=1986 |page=451 |isbn=3-87429-254-1}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Stearn2004\">{{cite book |author=Stearn WT. |title=Botanical Latin |publisher=Timber Press |location=Oregon |year=2004 |page=364 |isbn=0-88192-627-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0hZvTFJUioC&lpg=PA364&dq=aestivalis%20Latin&pg=PA364#v=onepage&q=&f=false |accessdate=2010-07-07}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IndexFungorum|292434}}\n{{Good article}}\n{{Amanitas}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q4739866}}\n\n[[Category:Amanita|Aestivalis]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1959]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Rolf Singer]]"}]}}}}

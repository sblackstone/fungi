It is among the most potent<ref>Paul Stamets, ''A Comparison of Combined Maxima of Psilocybin, Psilocin and Baeocystin in Eleven Species of Psilocybe'' [http://www.fungi.com/info/gallery/psilochart.html Fungi Perfecti]</ref> of the [[tryptamine]]-bearing mushrooms, containing up to 1.8% psilocybin, 0.5% psilocin, and 0.4% [[baeocystin]] by dry weight, averaging to about 1.1% psilocybin and 0.15% psilocin. It belongs to the family [[Hymenogastraceae]] in the order [[Agaricales]].\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe cap ([[Pileus (mycology)|pileus]]) of ''Psilocybe azurescens'' is 30\u2013100&nbsp;mm in diameter, conic to convex, expanding to broadly convex and eventually flattening with age with a pronounced, persistent broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]; surface smooth, [[viscous]] when moist, covered by a separable gelatinous [[pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]]; chestnut to ochraceous brown to caramel in color, often becoming pitted with dark blue or bluish black zones, [[hygrophanous]], fading to light straw color in drying, strongly bruising blue when damaged; margin even, sometimes irregular and eroded at maturity, slightly incurved at first, soon decurved, flattening with maturity, translucent striate and often leaving a fibrillose annular zone in the upper regions of the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. The [[Lamella (mycology)|lamellae]] are ascending, sinuate to adnate, brown, often stained into black where injured, close, with two tiers of lamellulae, mottled, edges whitish. The [[spore print]] is a dark purplish brown to purplish black in mass. The stipe is 90\u2013200&nbsp;mm in length and 3\u20136&nbsp;mm thick, silky white, dingy brown from the base or in age, hollow at maturity, and composed of twisted, cartilaginous tissue. The base of the stipe thickens downwards, is often curved, and is characterized by coarse white aerial tufts of [[mycelium]], often with azure tones. The mycelium surrounding the stipe base is densely [[rhizomorphic]] (i.e., root-like), silky white, tenaciously holding the wood-chips together, strongly bruising bluish upon disturbance. The fungus is odorless to slightly farinaceous, and its taste is extremely bitter.\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\n\n''P. azurescens'' occurs naturally along a small area of the [[West Coast of the United States]], including in parts of Oregon and California.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=Gaston|last2=Allen|first2=John W.|last3=Gartz|first3=Jochen|title=A Worldwide Geographical Distribution of the Neurotropic Fungi, An Analysis and Discussion|journal=Annali del Museo Civico di Rovereto|date=1998|volume=14|pages=219, 223|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237398624_A_Worldwide_geographical_distribution_of_the_Neurotropic_Fungi_an_analysis_and_discussion|accessdate=4 September 2017}}</ref> It has been regularly found as far south as [[Depoe Bay, Oregon]], and as far north as [[Grays Harbor County, Washington]]. Its primary locations are clustered around the [[Columbia River]] Delta: the first type collections were made in [[Hammond, Oregon]], near [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]]. It is also quite prevalent north of the Columbia River in Washington, from [[Long Beach, Washington|Long Beach]] north to [[Westport, Washington|Westport]]. Some feral specimens have also been reported in Stuttgart, Germany. While infrequent, the mushroom can sometimes be found around decaying wood in the [[Willamette Valley]] of Oregon. [[Ilwaco, Washington]] also has a large population, but harvesting is a potential felony that is enforced by local law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe species' preferred environment ranges from [[caespitose]] (growing in tight, separated clusters) to [[gregarious]] on [[deciduous]] wood-chips and/or in sandy soils rich in [[wikt:lignicolous|lignicolous]] (woody) debris. The mushroom has an affinity for coastal dune grasses.<ref name=\"world\">{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Stamets | year=1996 | title=Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World | publisher=Ten Speed Press | location=Berkeley | isbn=0-9610798-0-0}} p. 95.</ref> In aspect it generates an extensive, dense, and tenacious mycelial mat (''[[collyboid]]'').

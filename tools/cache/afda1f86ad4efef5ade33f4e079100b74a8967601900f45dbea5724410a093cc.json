In fact, it is one of the three most commonly implicated fungi in cases of mushroom poisoning in [[Japan]] (Other two are ''[[Omphalotus japonicus]]'' and ''[[Tricholoma ustale]]''). ''E. rhodopolium'' is often mistaken for edible mushroom, ''[[Entoloma sarcopum|E. sarcopum]]''. Symptoms are predominantly gastrointestinal in nature, though [[muscarine]], [[muscaridine]], and [[choline]] have been isolated as toxic agents.\n\nThe taxonomy of this species is currently unclear, with several different forms identified in North America, and questions over whether the European and North American fungi are even the same species.\n\n''Entoloma'' is a genus of pink spored fungi. An alternate scientific name seen is ''Rhodophyllus rhodopolius'', from Quelet's broader genus containing a larger subsection of pink-spored fungi.\n\n''Entoloma nidorosum'', previously considered a separate species, is now classified as a variety of this fungus.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Entoloma species|List of ''Entoloma'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nimage:Entoloma rhodopolium - Lindsey.jpg\nimage:Entoloma.rhodopolium2.-.lindsey.jpg\n</gallery>\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2422232}}\n\n[[Category:Poisonous fungi]]\n[[Category:Entolomataceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Elias Magnus Fries]]\n\n\n{{Agaricales-stub}}"}]}}}}

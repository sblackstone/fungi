Described as a new species in 2004, it was originally found in the [[Thai highlands]] growing in sandy or [[laterite]]-rich soil in dry lowland [[dipterocarp]] forests.<ref name=Phosri2004/> The species is found in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name=Phosri2007/>\n\n==Description==\n[[Sporocarp (fungi)|Fruit bodies]] begin as brownish spheres or flattened spheres, partially submerged in the earth. The outer tissue layer, the [[exoperidium]], splits open in a star-like fashion into 3\u20139 rays. The rays are [[hygroscopic]], spreading out when moist and curling inward when dry. The fully expanded fruit body measures up to {{convert|65|mm|in}} in diameter. Fresh fruit bodies have an odor similar to moist soil.<ref name=Phosri2004/>\n\nThe spores are spherical, covered with spines, and measure 7.5\u201315.2&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The ornamentation of the spines on the surface is less dense than that of the similar ''[[Astraeus hygrometricus]]''.<ref name=Phosri2004/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[File:Forest fire mae hong son province 01.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The mountain forests of [[Northern Thailand]] are set on fire by local farmers during the hot dry season from February to April in an attempt to increase the yield of the false earthstar.]]\n''Astraeus odoratus'' it is found in the dry lowland [[dipterocarp]] forests of Thailand. The fungus fruits during the rainy season in May and June, in sandy or [[laterite]]-rich soil.<ref name=Phosri2004/> It is associated with [[Alder]], [[Chestnut]], ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' and [[Douglas-fir]].<ref name=Sysouphanthong2010/>\n\nIn Thailand, it is commonly believed that forest fires stimulate the growth of mushrooms, including ''A.&nbsp;odoratus'', and fires are set intentionally to increase the yield of fruit bodies. Although the mushrooms may be easier to find and collect on the [[forest floor|litter]]-free ground of burnt forest, there is no evidence that burning increases yield, while it does decrease the biodiversity and yield of other edible mushroom-producing fungi.<ref name=Sysouphanthong2010/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Uses==\nSince they cannot be cultivated commercially, these mushrooms fetch a high price on the market.<ref name=Sysouphanthong2010/>\n\nYoung fruit bodies are collected from the wild and sold in the markets of [[Thailand]]. Thai people eat the blanched mushroom blanched with ''[[nam phrik]]'' (Thai chilli pastes) or ''[[nam chim]]'' (dipping sauces), or cooked in curry and also only boiled in water with [[fish sauce]] and [[palm sugar]]\".<ref name=Petcharat2003/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Petcharat2003>{{cite journal |author=Petcharat V. |year=2003 |title=Edible ''Astraeus'' (Basidiomycota) from Thailand |journal=Nordic Journal of Botany |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=499\u2013503 |doi=10.1111/j.1756-1051.2003.tb00423.x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Phosri2004>{{cite journal |vauthors=Phosri C, Watling R, Mart\u00edn MP, Whalley AJ |year=2004|title=The genus ''Astraeus'' in Thailand |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=453\u201363 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0089/002/0453.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Phosri2007>{{cite journal |vauthors=Phosri C, Mart\u00edn MP, Sihanonth P, Whalley AJ, Watling R |title=Molecular study of the genus ''Astraeus'' |journal=Mycological Research |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=275\u201386 |year=2007 |pmid=17360168 |doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2007.01.004}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Sysouphanthong2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sysouphanthong P, Thongkantha S, Zhao R, Soytong K, Hyde KD |title=Mushroom diversity in sustainable shade tea forest and the effect of fire damage |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |year=2010 |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=1401\u201315 |doi=10.1007/s10531-009-9769-1}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IndexFungorum|488422}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q15643796}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Astraeus Odoratus}}\n[[Category:Boletales]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 2004]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]"}]}}}}

It is regarded as edible by some authorities, although others call it suspect and it resembles inedible species.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first described by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838; its generic name derived from the [[Latin]] ''cortina'' \"veil\", and the specific ''triumphans'' \"triumphing\".<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|pages = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref> It is considered the same species as ''Cortinarius crocolitus'' Qu\u00e9let by some authorities. It is a member of the subgenus ''Phlegmacium'' within the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''; mushrooms of this group have sticky (or slimy in wet weather) caps and dry stipes.<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063005-8|page=88}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nIt has a 5&ndash;12&nbsp;cm (2&ndash;5&nbsp;in) diameter [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] which is yellowish in colour-darker in the centre and paler on the edges. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 7&ndash;17&nbsp;cm (3&ndash;7&nbsp;in) high and 1&ndash;2.5&nbsp;cm (0.4&ndash;1&nbsp;in) thick and swollen at the base, and is white up top and yellow lower down and bears the tan or brown remnants of the veil. The adnate [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]], which are hidden by a cream or white veil when young, are cream or lilac early on, and darken with the spores, which give a rusty coloured [[spore print]]. The almond-shaped spores measure 10&ndash;12.5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5.5&ndash;7&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The flesh is cream-coloured and the taste mild.<ref name=Nilper/><ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | last = Phillips |first=Roger | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page= 185}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Cortinarius triumphans'' appears under [[birch]] trees in autumn (fall) in [[Europe]], and [[Asia]] where it is widespread, but local. It is also reported from north eastern [[North America]]. It has a [[mycorrhizal]] relationship with birch trees (''[[Betula]]'').<ref name=Phillips06/>\n\n==Edibility==\nAlthough some mushroom guides list it as edible,<ref name=Nilper/> others treat it with suspicion,<ref name=Phillips06/> as many webcaps have been found to have toxins, not in the least the similarly brown-coloured [[lethal webcap]]s. This being the case, it is probably best to avoid it. Thomas Laessoe's 1998 book 'Mushrooms', describes the taste as bitter, with a not unpleasant smell.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Thomas Laessoe | year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Cortinarius species|List of ''Cortinarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2511449}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cortinarius triumphans}}\n[[Category:Cortinarius|triumphans]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]"}]}}}}

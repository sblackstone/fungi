Its [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruit body]] is golden-yellow in color throughout, while its [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] and [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] are covered in sharp scales. As it is a [[saprobic]] fungus, the fruit bodies typically appear in clusters on the [[tree stump|stump]]s of dead [[conifer]]ous trees.

The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially round, then convex and finally flattening with age. Its surface is bright yellow to orange, and covered with triangular scales ([[wiktionary:squamule|squamules]]) arranged in concentric rings.[[File:Pholiota.flammans2.-.lindsey.jpg|thumb|left|Below the level of the ring, the stem is covered in concentrically-arranged squamules.]] The cap surface is dry, matt and felt-like, and in wet conditions may lose scales. The cap margin remain curved slightly inwards. The yellow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded together, attached to the stem, and have a notch where the gill attaches to the stem.<ref name=Bessette1997/> A bright yellow [[partial veil]] extending from the cap edge to the edge is present in immature species. As the cap expands and flattens with age, the partial veil tears, leaving a faint [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] around the stem. The cylindrical straight or curved [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is itself covered in yellow squamules below the ring. The base of the stem, typically more orange in color than the upper portion,<ref name=Bessette1997/> is firmly attached to the dead wood from which the fungus arises. The section of stem above the ring bears little or no protuberances. The [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm, full, yellow and does not change color when bruised or injured.\n\nThe dimensions of the fruit body are as follows: cap diameter up to {{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}, stem up to {{convert|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall and between {{convert|0.4|to|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} cm thick.<ref name=Jordan2004>{{cite book |author=Jordan M|title=The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |year=2004 |page=261 |isbn=0-7112-2378-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFMfytLn3bEC&lpg=PA261&dq=Pholiota%20flammans&pg=PA261#v=onepage&q=Pholiota%20flammans&f=false|accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref>\nAs the fruit body matures, the gills darken to cinnamon brown following [[spore]] release.

A [[ectomycorrhiza]]l species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history, and has undergone several name changes since its first [[species description|description]] by American mycologist [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]] in 1822. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore-bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. The texture of the fertile undersurface ([[hymenium]]) of the [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known [[golden chanterelle]], the hymenium of ''C.&nbsp;lateritius'' is much smoother. [[Analytical chemistry|Chemical analysis]] has revealed the presence of several [[carotenoid]] compounds in the fruit bodies.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Miles Joseph Berkeley00.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Miles Joseph Berkeley|Berkeley]] is credited with the original authorship of the species.]]\n\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] in the scientific literature as ''Thelephora cantharella'' by the American [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]] in 1822, based on specimens collected in [[Ohio]].<ref name=Schweinitz1822/> [[Elias Magnus Fries]] later transferred it to ''[[Craterellus]]'' in his 1838 ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici''.<ref name=Fries1838/> In 1856, [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] mentioned the fungus in their analysis of Schweinitz's specimens, but changed the [[specific name (botany)|epithet]], calling it ''Craterellus lateritius''.<ref name=Berkeley1856/> The motivation for the name change is unclear; [[Ronald H. Petersen]], in a 1979 publication, suggests that Berkeley \"was apparently reluctant to surrender his own name for the organism\".<ref name=Petersen1979/> Petersen suggests that Berkeley may have foreseen the necessity to avoid giving the species a [[tautonym]] (a situation where both the generic name and [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] are identical). However, as Petersen indicates, a future publication renders this explanation dubious: in 1873 Berkeley again referred to the species using his chosen name ''Craterellus lateritius'', and indicated a [[Type locality (biology)|type location]] ([[Alabama]]) different than the one mentioned by Schweinitz.<ref name=Berkeley1873/> Petersen considers Berkeley's name to be a ''[[nomen novum]]'' (new name), not a new species, as Berkeley clearly indicated that he thought ''Craterellus lateritius'' was [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with Schweinitz's ''Thelephora cantharella''. Normally in these circumstances, Schweinitz's specimen would be considered the [[type (biology)|type]], but Petersen was unable to locate Schweinitz's original specimen, and thus according to the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|rules of botanical nomenclature]], Berkeley's epithet has [[Principle of Priority|precedence]] as it is the earliest published name that has an associated type specimen.<ref name=Petersen1979/>\n\nAnother synonym is ''Trombetta lateritia'', used by [[Otto Kuntze]] in his 1891 ''[[Revisio Generum Plantarum]]''.<ref name=Kuntze1891/> American mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] transferred it to the genus ''Cantharellus'' in 1951.<ref name=Singer1951/> The mushroom is commonly known as the \"smooth chanterelle\".<ref name=Kuo2007/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''lateritius'' means \"bricklike\", and refers to the smooth [[hymenium]].<ref name=Metzler1992/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Cantharellus lateritius 51632.jpg|thumb|left|The hymenium is initially smooth before developing shallow vein-like ridges in maturity.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of the ''C.&nbsp;lateritius'' [[basidiocarp|fruiting bodies]] typically range between {{convert|2|to|9|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, with a flattened to somewhat funnel-shaped top surface and a wavy margin. The cap surface is dry, slightly [[wikt:tomentose|tomentose]] (covered with a layer of fine hairs), and a deep and bright orange-yellow color, with older specimens fading to more yellow in age; the distinctive margins of the cap are a paler yellow,<ref name=Bigelow1978/> and typically curve downward in young specimens.<ref name=Petersen1979/> Fruiting bodies can reach a height of {{convert|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Petersen1979/> The hymenophore (the spore-bearing surface) is initially smooth and without wrinkles, but gradually develops channels or ridges, and what appear to be very shallow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that are vein-like, and less than 1&nbsp;mm wide.

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is rather plump and stout, {{convert|1.5|to|4.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.5|to|1.7|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick, more or less cylindrical, tapering downwards towards the base.

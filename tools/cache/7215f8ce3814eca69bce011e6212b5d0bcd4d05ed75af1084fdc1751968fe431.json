It was first [[fungiculture|cultivated]] in Germany as a subsistence measure during [[World War I]]<ref>Eger, G., Eden, G. & Wissig, E. (1976). ''Pleurotus ostreatus'' \u2013 breeding potential of a new cultivated mushroom. ''Theoretical and Applied Genetics'' 47: 155\u2013163.</ref> and is now grown commercially around the world for food. It is related to the similarly cultivated [[Pleurotus eryngii|king oyster mushroom]]. Oyster mushrooms can also be used industrially for [[mycoremediation]] purposes.\n\nThe oyster mushroom is one of the more commonly sought wild mushrooms, though it can also be cultivated on straw and other media. It has the bittersweet aroma of [[benzaldehyde]] (which is also characteristic of bitter almonds).<ref name=\"OysterAlde\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf960876i | title = Volatile Compounds Secreted by the Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus)and Their Antibacterial Activities | year = 1997 | last1 = Beltran-Garcia | first1 = Miguel J. | last2 = Estarron-Espinosa | first2 = Mirna | last3 = Ogura | first3 = Tetsuya | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 45 | pages = 4049 | issue = 10}}</ref>\n\n== Name ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nBoth the Latin and common names refer to the shape of the fruiting body. The Latin ''pleurotus'' (sideways) refers to the sideways growth of the stem with respect to the cap, while the Latin ''ostreatus'' (and the English common name, [[oyster]]) refers to the shape of the cap which resembles the bivalve of the same name. Many also believe that the name is fitting due to a flavor resemblance to oysters.\n\nThe name ''oyster mushroom'' is also applied to other ''[[Pleurotus]]'' species, so ''P. ostreatus'' is sometimes referred to as the ''tree oyster mushroom''<ref name=\"Stamets1\">{{cite book|last=Stamets|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Stamets|title=Growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms = [Shokuyo oyobi yakuyo kinoko no sabai]|edition=3rd|year=2000|publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]]|location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley, California, USA]]|isbn=978-1-58008-175-7|pages=308\u2013315|chapter=Chapter 21: Growth Parameters for Gourmet and Medicinal Mushroom Species}}</ref> or the ''grey oyster mushroom''<ref name=\"IanRHall\">{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Ian R.|date=April 2010|title=Growing mushrooms: the commercial reality|journal=Lifestyle Farmer|pages=42\u201345|accessdate=26 January 2012|url=http://www.trufflesandmushrooms.co.nz/April%20Lifestyle%20Farmer.pdf}}</ref> to differentiate it from other species in the genus.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pleurotus ostreatus Eglinton.JPG|left|thumb|150px|<center>Details of the gill structure</center>]]\nThe mushroom has a broad, fan or oyster-shaped '''cap''' spanning 5\u201325&nbsp;cm; natural specimens range from white to gray or tan to dark-brown; the margin is inrolled when young, and is smooth and often somewhat lobed or wavy. The flesh is white, firm, and varies in thickness due to [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] arrangement.  The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] of the mushroom are white to cream, and descend on the stalk if present. If so, the stipe is off-center with a lateral attachment to wood. The [[spore print]] of the mushroom is white to lilac-gray, and best viewed on dark background.\nThe mushroom's stipe is often absent. When present, it is short and thick.\n\n''[[Omphalotus nidiformis]]'' is a toxic lookalike found in Australia and Japan. In North America, ''[[Omphalotus olivascens]]'', the western jack-o'-lantern mushroom and ''[[Clitocybe dealbata]]'', the ivory funnel mushroom, both bear a resemblance to ''Pleurotus ostreatus''. Both ''Omphalotus olivascens'' and ''Clitocybe dealbata'' contain [[muscarine]] and are toxic.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Pleurotus ostreatus JPG6.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Oyster mushrooms on a tree]]\n\nThe oyster mushroom is widespread in many temperate and subtropical forests throughout the world, although it is absent from the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]], being replaced by ''[[Pleurotus pulmonarius|P. pulmonarius]]'' and ''[[Pleurotus populinus|P. populinus]]''.<ref name=amm09/> It is a [[saprotroph]] that acts as a primary decomposer of wood, especially deciduous trees, and beech trees in particular.<ref name=\"Phillips\">Phillips, Roger (2006), Mushrooms. Pub. McMilan, {{ISBN|0-330-44237-6}}. P. 266.</ref> It is a [[wood-decay fungus#White rot|white-rot wood-decay]] fungus.\n\nThe oyster mushroom is one of the few known carnivorous mushrooms. Its [[mycelia]] can kill and digest [[nematode]]s, which is believed to be a way in which the mushroom obtains [[nitrogen]].\n\nThe standard oyster mushroom can grow in many places, but some other related species, such as the branched oyster mushroom, grow only on trees. They may be found all year round in the UK.\n\nWhile this mushroom is often seen growing on dying hardwood trees, it only appears to be acting [[saprophyte|saprophytically]], rather than parasitically. As the tree dies of other causes, ''P. ostreatus'' grows on the rapidly increasing mass of dead and dying wood. They actually benefit the forest by decomposing the dead wood, returning vital elements and minerals to the ecosystem in a form usable to other plants and organisms.<ref name=\"Stamets2\">{{cite book|last=Stamets|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Stamets|title=Growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms = [Shokuyo oyobi yakuyo kinoko no sabai]|edition=3rd|year=2000|publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]]|location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley, California, USA]]|isbn=978-1-58008-175-7|pages=10\u201311|chapter=Chapter 2: The Role of Mushrooms in Nature}}</ref> Despite this, the belief that ''P. ostreatus'' could damage [[Forestry in New Zealand|New Zealand's forestry industry]] has led New Zealand to ban its importation.<ref name=\"IanRHall\" />\n\n==Culinary uses==\n[[File:Neutari (oyster mushroom).jpg|thumb|150px|Oyster mushrooms as presented in a Korean grocery store]]\nThe oyster mushroom is frequently used in [[Japanese food|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]] and [[Chinese food|Chinese cookery]] as a [[delicacy]]. It is frequently served on its own, in soups, stuffed, or in [[stir-fry]] recipes with [[soy sauce]]. Oyster mushrooms are sometimes made into a sauce, used in Asian cooking, which is similar to [[Oyster sauce#Vegetarian oyster sauce|oyster sauce]]. The mushroom's taste has been described as mild with a slight odor similar to [[anise]]. \nThe oyster mushroom is best when picked young; as the mushroom ages, the flesh becomes tough and the flavor becomes acrid and unpleasant.\n\nOyster mushrooms are widely cultivated and used in [[Kerala]], [[India]] where a wide variety of dishes are prepared from them. Oyster mushrooms are mainly cultivated in large clear [[polyethylene]] bags with buns of hay layered in the bags, and spawn sown between the layers.\n\nOyster mushrooms are also used in the [[Czech cuisine|Czech]] and [[Slovak cuisine|Slovak]] contemporary cuisine in soups and stews in a similar fashion to meat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dobruchut.azet.sk/hliva-ustricova |title=Slovak oyster mushroom recipes |accessdate=2015-07-21}}</ref>\n\nOyster mushrooms contain small amounts of [[arabitol]], a [[sugar alcohol]], which may cause gastrointestinal upset in some people.\n\n==Other uses==\nThe pearl oyster mushroom is also used to create [[mycelium]] bricks, [[MycoWorks#Technology|mycelium furniture]], and leather-like products.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Pleurotus species|List of ''Pleurotus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=kumm71>{{cite book| authorlink=Paul Kummer| author=Kummer, P.| year=1871| title=Der F\u00fchrer in die Pilzkunde| edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=amm09>{{cite book |last=Trudell |first=S. |last2=Ammirati |first2=J. |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest |series=Timber Press Field Guides |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2009 |page=134 |isbn=978-0-88192-935-5}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Books\n* Lincoff, G.H.

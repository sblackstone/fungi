It is known to occur primarily in southern Australia and [[Tasmania]], but was reported from India in 2012 and 2018. The fan- or funnel-shaped [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are up to {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} across, with cream-coloured [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] overlain with shades of orange, brown, purple, or bluish-black. The white or cream [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] run down the length of the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], which is up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and tapers in thickness to the base. The fungus is both [[saprotroph]]ic and [[parasitism|parasitic]], and its fruit bodies are generally found growing in overlapping clusters on a wide variety of dead or dying trees.\n\nFirst [[species description|described]] scientifically in 1844, the fungus has been known by several names in its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history. It was assigned its current name by [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.]] in 1994. Its scientific name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''nidus'' \"nest\", hence 'nest shaped'. Similar in appearance to the common edible [[oyster mushroom]], it was previously considered a member of the same genus, ''[[Pleurotus]]'', and described under the former names ''Pleurotus nidiformis'' or ''Pleurotus lampas''. Unlike oyster mushrooms, ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' is [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]]; while not lethal, its consumption leads to severe [[cramp]]s and vomiting. The toxic properties of the mushroom are attributed to compounds called [[illudin]]s. ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'' is one of several species in the [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] genus ''[[Omphalotus]]'', all of which have bioluminescent properties.\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\n\nThe ghost fungus was initially described in 1844 by English naturalist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] as ''Agaricus nidiformis''. Berkeley felt it was related to ''Agaricus ostreatus'' (now ''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]'') but remarked it was a \"far more magnificent species\".<ref name=\"Berkeley 1844\"/> Material was originally collected by Scottish naturalist [[James Drummond (botanist)|James Drummond]] in 1841 on ''[[Banksia]]'' wood along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]. He wrote \"when this fungus was laid on a newspaper, it emitted by night a phosphorescent light, enabling us to read the words around it; and it continued to do so for several nights with gradually decreasing intensity as the plant dried up.\"<ref name=\"Drummond 1841\"/> More material collected from near the base of a \"sickly but living\" shrub (''[[Grevillea drummondii]]'') was named as ''Agaricus lampas'' by Berkeley. He noted both were phosphorescent and closely related species.<ref name=\"Berkeley 1845\"/> [[Tasmania]]n botanist [[Ronald Campbell Gunn]] collected material in October 1845 from that state, which Berkeley felt differed from previous collections in having more demarcated and less [[decurrent]] gills and a shorter stipe, and named it ''Agaricus phosphorus'' in 1848.<ref name=\"Berkeley 1848\"/> Italian mycologist [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] placed all three named taxa in the genus ''[[Pleurotus]]'' in 1887.<ref name=\"Saccardo 1887\"/> These names have been [[synonym (biology)|synonymised]] with ''O.&nbsp;nidiformis'', although the name ''Pleurotus lampas'' persisted in some texts,<ref name=\"rbg\"/> including the 1934\u201335 [[monograph]] of Australian fungi by [[John Burton Cleland]].<ref name=\"Miller 1994\"/> In reviewing the published literature, Victorian botanical liaison officer [[James Hamlyn Willis|Jim Willis]] was aware of [[Rolf Singer]]'s placing of ''Pleurotus olearius'' into the genus ''[[Omphalotus]]'', but stopped short of transferring the ghost fungus across, even though he conceded it was wrongly placed in ''Pleurotus''.<ref name=\"Willis 1967\"/> Investigating the species in 1994, [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.]] gave the ghost fungus its current binomial name when he transferred it to the genus ''Omphalotus'' with other bioluminescent mushrooms.<ref name=\"Miller 1994\"/>\n\nThe [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''nidiformis'' is derived from the [[Latin]] terms ''n\u012bdus'' 'nest' and ''forma'' 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'.<ref name=\"Simpson 1979\"/> ''Lampas'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''lampas''/\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 'torch'.<ref name=\"Liddell 1980\"/> [[Common name]]s include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus.<ref name=\"Allen\"/> Drummond reported that the local [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aborigine]]s were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus and called out ''chinga'', a local word for spirit;<ref name=\"Cleland l976\"/> Drummond himself likened it to a [[will-o'-the-wisp]].<ref name=\"Drummond 1841\"/> Likewise on the [[Springbrook, Queensland|Springbrook Plateau]] in southeastern Queensland, the local [[Kombumerri people]] believed the lights to be ancestors and gave the area a wide berth out of respect.<ref name=\"Maguire 2011\"/>\n{{quote box\n| align = left\n| width = 25em\n| quote = The effect produced by it upon the traveller, when on a dark night he comes suddenly upon it glowing in the woods, is startling; for to a person unacquainted with this phenomenon the pale, livid, and deadly light emanating from it conveys to him an impression of something supernatural, and often causes no little degree of terror in weak minds or in those willing to believe in supernatural agencies.|salign=right|source=[[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]]<ref name=\"Cooke 1895\" />\n| bgcolor = #c6dbf7\n}}\nSeveral ''Omphalotus'' species with similar bioluminescent properties occur worldwide, all of which are presumed poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (''[[Omphalotus olearius|O.&nbsp;olearius]]'') and the ''tsukiyotake'' (''[[Omphalotus japonicus|O.&nbsp;japonicus]]'' (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill. (formerly known as ''Lampteromyces japonicus'' (Kawam.) Sing.), found in Japan and eastern Asia. A 2004 [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] study shows the ghost fungus to be most closely related to the western jack o'lantern mushroom (''[[Omphalotus olivascens|O.&nbsp;olivascens]]''), which is abundant in Southern and Central [[California]].<ref name=\"Kirchmair 2004\"/> Miller notes that the colours and shades of the ghost fungus most closely resemble this species.<ref name=\"Miller 1994\"/>\n\nLaboratory breeding experiments with it and other ''Omphalotus'' species have revealed a low level of compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time.<ref name=\"Peterson 1997a\"/> It is particularly poorly compatible with ''[[Omphalotus illudens|O.&nbsp;illudens]]'', the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Late Carboniferous]] separation of [[Gondwana]] from [[Laurasia]] but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.<ref name=\"Hughes 1997\"/>\n\n=== Variation ===\nMiller noted there appeared to be two colour forms reported across its range, namely a more cream-coloured form with darker shades of brown and grey in its cap that darkens with age, and a more wholly brownish form with paler edges and darker centre to its cap. He found the cream-coloured form to be strongly luminescent\u2014the brightest of any fungus in the genus\u2014with the cap, stipe and gills all glowing. The brown form was generally fainter, with its luminescence restricted to the gills. However, some strongly luminescent wholly brown-coloured mushrooms were recorded, and laboratory experiments showed all [[Mating in fungi|interbred]] freely and produced fertile offspring, leading Miller to conclude that these were [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] variants of a single [[taxon]].<ref name=\"Miller 1994\"/><!-- cites para -->\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Omphalotus nidiformis-darker.JPG|thumb|left|Darker-coloured fruit bodies, Botany, Sydney]]\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of the ghost fungus can be found on dead or diseased wood.<ref name=\"Marks 1982\"/> They may be first seen at night as a pale whitish glow at the base of trees in a eucalypt forest.<ref name=\"Cleland l976\"/> The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is very variable in colour, sometimes cream though often tinted with orange, brownish, greyish, purple or even bluish-black shades.

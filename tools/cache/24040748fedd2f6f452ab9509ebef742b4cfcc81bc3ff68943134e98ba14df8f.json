First documented in 1980 in the [[Pacific Northwest]], it is relatively uncommon and can be distinguished from other closely related species by its smaller spores and forking [[cheilocystidia]].\n''[[Psilocybe cyanescens]]'' also has forking [[cheilocystidia]], but less often than ''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa''. ''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa'' is also distinguished from ''Psilocybe cyanescens'' by an absence of [[pleurocystidia]]. \nThe name of this species refers to the fibrils on the [[Stipe (mycology)]] that turn bluish in age, or when handled.\n\nThis species is closely related to ''[[Psilocybe subfimetaria]]''.\n\n==Description==\n''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa'' has a [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] smell and taste.\n\n===Pileus===\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|Pileus]] is 1.4\u20133.5&nbsp;cm in diameter and [[conic]] to [[wikt:convex|convex]] to broadly convex then becoming flat in age. It is not usually [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]]. The pileus is deep chestnut brown and [[hygrophanous]], fading to yellowish brown or grayish white when dry. The surface is [[wikt:viscid|viscid]] when moist from the separable gelatinous [[pellicle (biology)|pellicle]].\n\n===Gills===\nThe [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are  [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] to [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] to slightly [[wikt:subdecurrent|subdecurrent]] in age. It is light grayish, becoming purplish brown with age while the edges remain whitish.\n\n===Spores===\n''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa'' [[spore]]s are purplish brown in deposit, [[wikt:subellipsoid|subellipsoid]] in shape, and (9)9.5\u201311(12) x (5.5)6\u20136.6(7) [[micrometre|\u03bcm]].\n\n===Stipe===\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 3\u20138&nbsp;cm long and 0.5&nbsp;cm thick. It has an equal structure only enlarging near the base. The stipe is [[wikt:striate|striate]], pallid to yellow brown with fine fibrils that stain blue when handled. The stipe has a [[wikt:cortina|cortina]] that sometimes leaves a fragile [[wikt:annular zone|annular zone]]. White [[mycelial cord|rhizomorph]]s are at the base. The flesh is brownish and bruises bluish to indigo-black.\n\n===Microscopic features===\n''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa'' [[basidium|basidia]] each produce four spores, and rarely only two spores. The [[cheilocystidia]] are [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] to [[wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate]] and 22\u201333 x 5.5\u20137 [[\u03bcm]], with an elongated, forking neck and are 1\u20131.5&nbsp;\u03bcm thick at its apex. [[Pleurocystidia]] are absent in ''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa''.\n\n==Habitat and formation==\n''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa'' is found growing scattered to [[gregarious]], from September to December from Northern [[California]] to [[British Columbia, Canada]]. It is found in soils enriched with [[deciduous]] wood debris, among bush [[lupin]]es, in [[Alder]] and [[Willow]] wood chips and bark mulch, [[Fir]] sawdust, in coastal regions, in [[rhododendron]] gardens and nurseries, and in flood plains in river [[estuaries]].\n\n==Chemistry==\nBoth [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] (0.05&nbsp;mg per gram dry weight and 1.4&nbsp;mg per gram psilocin) were detected by Beug and Bigwood.\n\n==References==\n* Stamets PE, Beug MW, Bigwood JE, Guzm\u00e1n G.

Has partial veil remnants when young.  The cap surface is usually dry, but can be slightly viscid when moist.  \n*'''Gills''': Close, white to pale gray at first, later darker purple/brown or purplish grey with whitish edges. Attached (adnexed to adnate) and often notched.\n*'''Spores''': Dark purple/brown.  10-13.5 x 6-8.5 m. Elliptical and smooth.\n*'''Stipe''': Whitish, often with dark orange stains in age (most evident around base), 4\u20138&nbsp;cm long, .5 to 1&nbsp;cm wide, equal to slightly larger at the base, which often has pale yellowish mycelium attached.  The veil is thin and leaves a fragile ring, sometimes not present with age.  The stalk is smooth above the ring and has tiny scales below, which often wash off in rain. \n*'''Taste''': Mild\n*'''Odor''': Mild\n*'''Edibility''': Poisonous\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Leratiomyces ceres (2004).jpg|Leratiomyces ceres\nImage:Leratiomyces ceres spores 1000x.JPG|Spores 1000x\nFile:Leratiomyces ceres (formerly known as Stropharia aurantiaca, Hypholoma aurantiaca, Naematoloma aurantiaca, etc.) (15809298769).jpg\nFile:Leratiomyces ceres (formerly known as Stropharia aurantiaca, Hypholoma aurantiaca, Naematoloma aurantiaca, etc.) (15993317231).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Hypholoma_aurantiaca.html Mykoweb - Stropharia aurantiaca]\n*[http://www.mushroomexpert.com/stropharia_aurantiaca.html Mushroom Expert - Stropharia aurantiaca]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q15651408}}\n\n[[Category:Strophariaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Fungi native to Australia]]\n\n\n{{Agaricales-stub}}"}]}}}}

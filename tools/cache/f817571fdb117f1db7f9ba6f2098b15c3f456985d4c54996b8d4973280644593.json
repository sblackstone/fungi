Found in China, the fruit bodies produced by the species are brown, woody [[basidiocarp]]s that grow on dead wood, where the fungus feeds as a [[saprotroph]]. The basidiocarps are [[perennial]], allowing them to grow very large under favourable circumstances. They are [[resupinate]], measuring {{convert|30|cm|in}} or more in length, though typically extending less than a centimetre from the surface of the wood. ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'' produces distinct [[ellipsoid]]al [[basidiospore|spores]], after which it is named, and unusual [[seta]]e. These two features allow it to be readily differentiated microscopically from other, similar species. [[Chemical compound]]s isolated from the species include several [[steroid]]al compounds. These may have [[pharmacological]] applications, but further research is needed.\n\nThe species was named in 2008 by Bao-Kai Cui and Yu-Cheng Dai based on collections made in [[Fujian Province]]. It was placed in the genus ''[[Fomitiporia]]'', but later analysis suggests that it is more closely related to ''[[Phellinus]]'' species. It was revealed in 2011 that a very large fruit body, measuring up to {{convert|1085|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, had been found on [[Hainan Island]]. The specimen, which was 20 years old, was estimated to weigh between {{convert|400|and|500|kg|lb}}. This was markedly larger than the previously largest recorded fungal fruit body, a specimen of ''[[Rigidoporus ulmarius]]'' found in the United Kingdom that had a circumference of {{convert|425|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The findings were formally published in September 2011, but attracted international attention from the mainstream press prior to this.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogenetics==\nThe species was first described in 2008 by Bao-Kai Cui and Yu-Cheng Dai, both of the [[Beijing Forestry University]].<ref name=\"MBand343\">MycoBank; Cui and Dai 2008, p. 343</ref> Five specimens of the then-unknown species were collected during field work in the [[Wanmulin Nature Reserve]] ({{coord|27|03|N|118|08|E|region:CN-62_type:landmark}}), [[Jian'ou]], [[Fujian Province]].<ref name=\"p344\"/> The pair named the species ''Fomitiporia ellipsoidea'' in an article in the journal ''[[Mycotaxon]]''.<ref name=\"MBand343\"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''ellipsoidea'' is from the [[Latin]] meaning \"ellipsoid\", and refers to the shape of the spores.<ref name=\"p344\">Cui and Dai 2008, p. 344</ref> Species of the order [[Hymenochaetales]], to which this taxon belongs, make up 25% of the over 700 species of [[polypore]] found in China.<ref>Dai 2011, p. 1</ref>\n\n[[Phylogenetic analysis]] of [[28S ribosomal RNA|large subunit]] and [[internal transcribed spacer]] [[DNA sequence]] data, the results of which were published in 2012, concluded that the species then known as ''F.&nbsp;ellipsoidea'' was closely related to ''[[Phellinus gabonensis]]'', ''[[Phellinus caribaeo-quercicolus|P.&nbsp;caribaeo-quercicolus]]'' and the newly described ''[[Phellinus castanopsidis|P.&nbsp;castanopsidis]]''. The four species share [[Morphology (biology)|morphological characteristics]], and form a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] [[clade]]. This clade resolved more closely with the ''[[Phellinus]]'' [[type species]] ''[[Phellinus igniarius|P.&nbsp;igniarius]]'' than it did with the ''Fomitiporia'' type species ''[[Fomitiporia langloisii|F.&nbsp;langloisii]]'', and so the authors proposed a transference of ''F.&nbsp;ellipsoidea'' to ''Phellinus'', naming the [[new combination]] ''Phellinus ellipsoideus''.<ref>Cui and Decock 2013, pp. 341\u20132, 349</ref> While the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] database [[Index Fungorum]] follows the 2012 study, [[MycoBank]] continues to list ''Fomitiporia ellipsoidea'' as the correct binomial.<ref name=\"MBIF\">MycoBank; Index Fungorum</ref> Some mycologists consider ''Fomitiporia'' to be a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] of ''Phellinus'' anyway.<ref name=\"CD349\">Cui and Decock 2013, p. 349</ref>\n\n==Description==\n{{ mycomorphbox\n| name             = ''Phellinus ellipsoideus''\n| capShape         = no\n| whichGills       = NA\n| hymeniumType     = pores\n| stipeCharacter   = NA\n| ecologicalType   = saprotrophic\n}}\n''Phellinus ellipsoideus'' produces [[resupinate]] fruit bodies that are hard and woody, whether fresh or dry.<ref name=\"p344\"/> The original [[species description|description]] characterized them as measuring up to {{convert|30|cm|in}} \"or more\" in length,<ref>Cui and Dai 2008, pp. 344, 346</ref> {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width, and extending {{convert|8|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} from the wood on which they grow at their thickest point.{{#tag:ref|These sizes are based on the original [[species description|description]] offered by Cui and Dai in 2008.<ref>Cui and Dai 2008</ref> Dai described the [[type specimen]] as \"not huge\", and a significantly larger specimen has since been found. Dai said that, before the discovery, he and Cui \"did not know the fungus [could] grow so huge\".<ref name=\"BBC\">Walker 2011</ref>|group=note}} The outermost layer is typically yellow to yellowish-brown, measuring {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in thickness. The shiny surface of the [[hymenium]], the spore-producing section of the fruit body, is covered in pores and ranges in colour from yellow-brown to rust-brown. There are between 5 and 8 pores per millimetre. The tubes are up to {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in depth, have the same colouration as the surface of the hymenium, and are distinctively layered. They are also hard and woody. The very thin yellow-brown layer of [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] measures less than {{convert|0.5|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in width. As with much of the rest of the fruit body, it is firm, solid, and reminiscent of wood.<ref name=\"p346\">Cui and Dai 2008, p. 346</ref> The fruit bodies lack any odour or taste.<ref name=\"p344\"/>\n\n===Microscopic features===\n''Phellinus ellipsoideus'' produces [[basidiospores]] that are [[ellipsoid]]al or broadly ellipsoidal in shape. The spore shape is one of the features that makes the species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 [[micrometre]]s&nbsp;(\u03bcm). The average spore length is 5.25&nbsp;\u03bcm, while the average width is 4.14&nbsp;\u03bcm. The spores have thick [[cell walls]], and are [[hyaline]]. They are strongly [[cyanophilous]], meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb [[methyl blue]] stain. In addition, they are weakly [[dextrinoid]], meaning that they will [[staining|stain]] slightly reddish-brown in [[Melzer's reagent]] or [[Lugol's solution]]. The spores are borne on barrel-shaped [[basidia]], with four spores per basidium, measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7&nbsp;\u03bcm. There are also [[basidioles]], which are similar in shape to the basidia, but slightly smaller.<ref name=\"p346\"/>\n\nIn addition to the spore shape, the species is readily identified with the use of a microscope because of its [[setae]]. Setae are a kind of unusual [[cystidia]] unique to the family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'', are found in the hymenium. In shape, the setae are [[ventricose]], with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14&nbsp;\u03bcm. Neither more standard cystidia nor [[cystidiole]]s (underdeveloped cystidia) can be found in the species, but there are a number of [[rhomboid]] crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh.<ref name=\"p346\"/>\n\nMost of the tissue of a fungal fruit body is made up of [[hyphae]], which can be of three forms: generative, skeletal and binding. In ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'', the tissue is dominated by skeletal hyphae, but also has generative hyphae; it lacks binding hyphae. For this reason, the hyphal structure of ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'' is referred to as \"dimitic\". The hyphae are divided into separate cells by [[septae]], and lack [[clamp connections]]. The skeletal hyphae do not react with Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution, and are not cyanophilous. While the hyphae will darken when a solution of [[potassium hydroxide]] is applied (the [[KOH test]]), they remain otherwise unchanged.<ref name=\"p346\"/>\n\nThe main structure of the fruit body consists primarily of an [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] (mass) of interwoven skeletal hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter, enveloping a [[lumen (biology)|lumen]] of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae, and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter.<ref name=\"p346\"/> The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some generative hyphae. The thick-walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter, while the generative hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter.<ref name=\"p346\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nA cogeneric species potentially similar to ''Phellinus ellipsoideus'' is ''[[Phellinus caribaeo-quercicola|P.&nbsp;caribaeo-quercicola]]''.<ref name=\"p347\"/>   The latter species shares the hooked hymenial setae and ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal spores. However, details of the fruit body differ, and the spores are hyaline to yellowish, and not dextrinoid.<ref name=\"p347\"/> Further, the species is known only from tropical America, where it grows on the [[Quercus cubana|Cuban oak]].<ref name=\"p347\"/> ''[[Phellinus castanopsidis|P.&nbsp;castanopsidis]]'', newly described in 2013, is not perennial, and has a pale greyish-brown pore surface. The spores are also slightly larger than those of ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus''.<ref>Cui and Decock 2013, pp. 346, 349</ref>\n\n''Phellinus ellipsoideus'' differs from species of ''Fomitiporia'' in two key respects. Its spores are less dextrinoid than those of the genus and their shape is atypical. Other than this, it is typical of the genus, according to the original description.<ref>Cui and Dai 2008, pp. 346\u20137</ref> Five species of ''Fomitiporia'', ''[[Fomitiporia bannaensis|F.&nbsp;bannaensis]]'', ''[[Fomitiporia pseudopunctata|F.&nbsp;pseudopunctata]]'', ''[[Fomitiporia sonorae|F.&nbsp;sonorae]]'', ''[[Fomitiporia sublaevigata|F.&nbsp;sublaevigata]]'' and ''[[Fomitiporia tenuis|F.&nbsp;tenuis]]'', share with ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'' the resupinate fruit bodies and the setae in the hymenium. Despite this, all of them but ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'' have straight hymenial setae, and all of them have spores that are spherical or almost spherical, which is much more typical of the genus.<ref name=\"p347\">Cui and Dai 2008, p. 347</ref> ''[[Fomitiporia uncinata|F.&nbsp;uncinata]]'' (formerly ''Phellinus uncinatus'') has hooked hymenial setae, and the spores are, as with ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'', thick-walled and dextrinoid. The species can be differentiated by the fact the spores are spherical or nearly so, and somewhat larger than those of ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'', measuring 5.5 to 7 by 5 to 6.5&nbsp;\u03bcm. The species is also known only from tropical America, where it grows on [[bamboo]].<ref name=\"p347\"/><ref name=\"p173\">Dai 2010, p. 173</ref>\n\n==Distribution and ecology==\n{{Location map many | China\n| relief   = \n| width    = 300\n| caption  = The locations of the [[type specimen]]'s collection (''A'', [[Fujian Province]])<ref name=\"p344\"/> and the large fruit body's discovery (''B'', [[Hainan Province]]).<ref name=\"FB1\"/> ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'' is found in \"subtropical to tropical\" areas of China.<ref name=\"p10\"/>\n| marksize = 6\n| pos      = right\n| lat1_deg = 27.05\n| lon1_deg = 118.133\n| label1   = A\n| pos2     = top\n| mark2size = 6\n| lat2_deg = 18.74153611\n| lon2_deg = 108.8453749\n| label2   = B\n}}\n''Phellinus ellipsoideus'' has been recorded growing on the fallen wood of [[oak]]s of the [[subgenus]] ''[[Cyclobalanopsis]]'', as well as the wood of other [[flowering plants]].<ref>Cui and Dai 2008, p. 343; Dai 2011, p. 10</ref> The species favours the [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]]s of trees,<ref name=\"p10\">Dai 2011, p. 10</ref> where it feeds as a [[saprotroph]], causing [[white rot]].<ref name=\"p346\"/> ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'' fruit bodies are [[perennial]] growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large.<ref name=\"BBC\"/> The species is found in the [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] areas of China;<ref name=\"p10\"/> it has been recorded in [[Fujian Province]] and [[Hainan Province]].<ref name=\"BBC\"/> It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.<ref name=\"p10\"/>\n\n===Largest fruit body===\nIn 2010, Cui and Dai were performing field work in tropical woodland on [[Hainan Island]], China, studying [[wood-decay fungus|wood-rotting fungi]].

Money, executive editor of ''Fungal Biology'', in which the findings were published, praised the pair for not removing the fruit body, thereby allowing it \"to continue its business and to marvel visitors to Hainan Island\".<ref name=\"Money\"/> The discovery was formally published in ''[[Fungal Biology]]'' in September 2011,<ref name=\"FB1\"/> but gained attention in the mainstream press worldwide prior to this.<ref>Pulyaevsky 2011; Wahono 2011; Walker 2011</ref>\n\nThe fruit body was 20 years old, and up to {{convert|1085|cm|ft|abbr=on}} long. It was between {{convert|82|and|88|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, and between {{convert|4.6|and|5.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The total volume of the fruit body was somewhere between {{convert|409000|and|525000|cm3|in3}}. It was estimated to weigh between {{convert|400|and|500|kg|lb}}, based on three samples from different areas of the fruit body.<ref name=\"FB1\">Cui and Dai 2011, p. 813</ref> The specimen had an average of 49 pores per square millimetre, roughly equivalent to 425 million pores.<ref>Cui and Dai 2011, pp. 813\u20134</ref> Money estimated that, based on spore output from other polypore species, the fruit body would be able to release a trillion spores a day.<ref>Money 2011; Money 2015, p. 91</ref>\n\nPrior to this discovery, the largest recorded fruit body of any fungus was a specimen of ''[[Rigidoporus ulmarius]]'', found in [[Kew Gardens]], United Kingdom. It measured {{convert|150|by|133|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and had a circumference of {{convert|425|cm|in|abbr=on}}. While the largest individual fruit bodies belong to polypores, individual organisms belonging to certain ''[[Armillaria]]'' species can grow extremely large. In 2003, a large specimen of ''[[Armillaria solidipes|A.&nbsp;solidipes]]'' (synonymous with ''A.&nbsp;ostoyae'') was recorded in the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]], [[Oregon]], covering an area of {{convert|965|ha|acre}}. At the time, the organism was estimated to be 8650 years old. Prior to this, an ''[[Armillaria gallica|A.&nbsp;gallica]]'' (synonymous with ''A.&nbsp;bulbosa'') organism was the largest recorded, covering {{convert|15|ha|acre}}, weighing approximately {{convert|9700|kg|lb}}. However, whilst these organisms cover a large area, the individual fruit bodies (the [[mushroom]]s) are not remarkably large, typically with [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]s of up to {{convert|10|cm|in}} in height and [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s less than {{convert|15|cm|in}} in diameter, weighing from {{convert|40|to|100|g|oz}} each.<ref name=\"FB1\"/>\n\n==Medicinal uses and biochemistry==\n[[File:Ergosterol structure.svg|thumb|right|[[Ergosterol]], a chemical isolated from ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'']]\nThe fruit bodies of both ''Phellinus'' and ''Fomitiporia'' species have seen use in [[traditional medicine]] for [[gastrointestinal cancer]] and [[heart disease]].<ref>Lifeng, Bao, Bau, Liu and Cui 2012, p. 1482</ref>\n\nIn 2011, research into the chemistry of ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'' was published in the journal ''Mycosystema'' by Cui, along with Hai-Ying Bao and Bao-Kai Liu of the [[Jilin Agricultural University]]. The research discussed how several [[chemical compounds]]  could be isolated from ''P. ellipsoideus'' with [[petroleum ether]] and (after defatting) [[chloroform]]. The nine compounds isolated from these extracts included the common [[ergosterol]] and its [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] [[ergosterol peroxide]]. Two of the compounds, ergosta-7,22,25-triene-3-one and benzo[1,2-b:5,4-b']difuran-3,5-dione-8-methyl formate, were new to science.<ref>Bao, Cui and Liu 2011, p. 159</ref> All of these chemicals were [[steroidal]];<ref name=\"later publications\"/> such compounds play important physiological roles in [[cell membrane]]s.<ref name=\"BCL163\"/>\n\nSteroidal compounds, like those isolated from ''P.&nbsp;ellipsoideus'', can have [[pharmacological]] applications; for instance, some can act as [[Anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatories]] (including ergosterol) or inhibit tumour growth.

(1986). ''Amanita'' of North America. {{ISBN|0-916422-55-0}}</ref> It is distinguished from other species in section ''Vaginatae'' by its lack of any kind of [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] on its pileus, its short pileus [[wikt:striae|striae]], and its distinct pale orange to pale salmon coloration when young. Its coloration can become more brownish with age and entirely white specimens are occasionally seen as well.<ref name=tulloss/> Like many other ''Amanita'', the gills are white, but occasionally have a distinct pinkish or orangish tint.<ref name=tulloss/><ref name=jenkins/> In older specimens, the odor can become pungent and fishy.<ref name=arora/><ref name=rich>Rich R. (2002). [http://www.rrich.com/msamavelo.html \"Amanita velosa\".] ''Robert's Wild Mushroom Cookbook'' (website).</ref>\n\n==Habitat and range==\n''Amanita velosa'' is a late-season mushroom in its range of occurrence, being found from midwinter into spring, up until the end of the California [[Wet season|rainy season]]. Its favored habitat is the [[ecotone]] between [[oak]] (particularly [[coast live oak]]) woodlands and open grassland, living in an [[ectomycorrhizal]] relationship with young oak trees.<ref name=arora/><ref name=jenkins/><ref name=mykoweb>Wood M, Stevens F. (2004). [http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Amanita_velosa.html ''Amanita velosa''.] ''MykoWeb'' (website).</ref>\n\nAlthough this species is primarily known from the coastal regions of California, Oregon, and Baja California, it is also reported to have been found in association with [[aspen]] and [[conifers]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] <ref name=arora/> and there is also one report of this species being found growing with [[spruce]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], in the eastern United States.<ref name=jenkins/>\n\n==Edibility and identification==\n[[File:Amanita_velosa.jpg|thumb|left|''A. velosa'']]\n\nIt is considered to be an outstanding edible species with a distinctively sweet or nutty flavor.<ref name=arora/><ref name=rich/> However, great caution must be exercised to properly identify it, as the deadly ''[[Amanita ocreata]]'' (and occasionally ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'') is also found in the same habitat at the same time of year, and can often be found in close proximity to each other. ''A. ocreata'' and ''A. phalloides'' have thin universal veil remnants, a sac-like volva, an annulus, a non-striate pileus margin, and a pileus that is a different color than ''A. velosa''.<ref name=arora/><ref name=mykoweb/> These differences can fade as the [[fruiting body]] ages, making it important to collect only specimens that have all of their identifying characteristics intact.<ref>Street C.

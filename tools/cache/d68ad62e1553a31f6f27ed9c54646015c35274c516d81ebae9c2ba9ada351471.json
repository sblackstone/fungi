It is associated with trees, especially ''[[Abies]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Salix]]'', and occasionally ''[[Castanopsis]]''. It fruits singly or scattered from June to September.<ref name=\"Yang 2004\"/>\n\nThis medium to large agaric has a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with a diameter measuring {{convert|5|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] length of up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a thickness of {{convert|0.5|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. [[Lamella (mycology)|Gills]] on the cap underside are free from attachment to the stipe, crowded closely together, and white to cream in colour with brownish edges. The fruit body has a sac-like [[volva (mycology)|volva]] and lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the stipe. The overall colour of the fruit body is brownish with a yellowish to orange cap centre. Its [[basidiospore|spores]] are spherical or nearly so, measuring 10\u201314 by 9.5\u201313&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. Names for its similarity to the widespread ''[[Amanita fulva]]'' (a species with which it was previously confused), it can be distinguished from ''A.&nbsp;fulva'' by microscopic features of the volva.<ref name=\"Yang 2004\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Yang 2004\">{{cite journal |vauthors =Yang ZL, Weiss M, Oberwinkler F |url=http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/reprint/96/3/636 |title=New species of ''Amanita'' from the eastern Himalaya and adjacent regions |journal=Mycologia |year=2004 |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=636\u201346 |doi=10.2307/3762180 |pmid=21148883}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{Amanitas}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1945904}}\n\n[[Category:Amanita|orientufulva]]\n[[Category:Fungi of China]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 2004]]\n\n\n{{Agaricales-stub}}"}]}}}}

It is [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] for most people, causing gastrointestinal upset, but can be eaten by some without apparent negative effect.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThis species was first officially defined under the name ''Agaricus xanthodermus'' in 1876 by L\u00e9on Gaston Genevier, in a letter published in the bulletin of the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France|French Botanical Society]].<ref name=SBF/><ref name=IndexFungorum/>  Genevier described the ''[[Agaricus]]'' mushrooms commonly eaten (perhaps sometimes inadvisedly) in the region of [[Nantes]], and attempted to clarify the distinctions between them. He proposed a detailed reclassification into 5 species, including this new one. Apparently up until that time, these yellow-staining mushrooms were considered to be just varieties of other species which are edible: ''[[Agaricus arvensis|A. arvensis]]'', ''[http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=508604 A. edulis]'', and ''[[Agaricus silvicola|A. silvicola]]''.<ref name=Genevier/>\n\nThe epithet ''xanthodermus'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words for \"yellow\" and \"skin\", which were then given a Latin adjective ending. This is the official name, but the form ''Agaricus xanthoderma'' is also often seen.<ref name=\"Bon\"/><ref name=\"Courtecuisse\"/><ref name=Moser/>  In the latter name, ''-derma'' \"skin\" is a neuter noun which does not have to agree in gender with ''Agaricus'', and so this form is legal according to the rules of botanical nomenclature.<ref name=\"Nomenclature\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:2011-10-13 Agaricus xanthodermus Genev 181971.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is generally {{convert|6|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter, though can reach {{convert|15|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. It is initially convex, with some young specimens having a squarish shape, though flattening with age. It is whitish, with light brown tints towards the centre. The cap is dry and smooth, but can be scaly when old. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] of this mushroom progress from pale-pink to a chocolate color. The spore print is brown. Its white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is bulbous with a skirt-like ring. Microscopically, the [[Cystidium|cheilocystidia]] are club-shaped. The spores are 6\u20137\u00d73\u20134&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]].\n\nThe main identifying feature is an immediate bright yellow colouration on cutting through the base of the stem, or scraping the flesh; later, the affected area fades to a dull brown. Numerous edible ''Agaricus'' species, such as ''[[Agaricus augustus|A. augustus]]'', ''[[Agaricus arvensis|A. arvensis]]'' and ''[[Agaricus silvicola|A. silvicola]]'', turn yellow to a greater or lesser extent, but they do not display such an intense reaction.\n[[File:Cooked_Agaricus_xanthodermus_in_pan.png|thumb|left|After cooking, intese color change to yellow occurs and the smell of [[Phenol]] becomes very intense.]]\n\n''Agaricus xanthodermus'' has an unpleasant characteristic smell, which is phenolic, reminiscent of ink or [[carbolic soap]]. The smell is especially strong at the base of the stem.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n\nThis mushroom is very common and widely distributed in [[North America]], [[Europe]], West Asia including eastern [[Anatolia]]<ref name=Dem04/> and Iran,<ref name=Asef2010/> North Africa,<ref name=\"Courtecuisse\"/> and [[southern Africa]].<ref name=Westhuizen/>  It has been introduced into [[Australia]]. It occurs in woods, lawns, gardens and hedgerows in autumn. This is a [[saprobic]] species.\n\n==Poisonous character==\nIt appears that some people can eat this mushroom without ill effects,<ref name=Phillips/><ref name=Genevier/><ref name=Jordan/> but it can cause serious gastric problems. It is indigestible and gives rise to symptoms of sweating, flushing, and severe stomach cramps.<ref name=Phillips/><ref name=Bon/><ref name=Jordan/>\n\nOf those who gather ''Agaricus''-style mushrooms, about 50% of the cases of poisoning are from this species. On cooking, the smell becomes very noticeable, and this may deter people from eating it inadvertently.<ref name=Jordan/>\n\n==Related species==\n''A. xanthodermus'' belongs to a group of related species  (the \"Xanthodermatei\") which likewise discolour bright yellow and have a phenolic smell. They include ''A. praeclaresquamosus'' (formerly ''[[Agaricus placomyces|A. placomyces]]'') which has dark grey scales, ''[[Agaricus moelleri|A. moelleri]]'', and ''[[Agaricus pilatianus|A. pilatianus]]'', which does not have a bulbous stem.<ref name=\"Courtecuisse\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n* [[List of Agaricus species|List of ''Agaricus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Asef2010>{{cite book |title=\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0686\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 (Qarch-ha-ye Sammi-ye Iran) |trans-title=Poisonous mushrooms of Iran |year=2010 |author =Asef Shayan, M.R. |publisher=Iran shenasi |page=214 |isbn=978-964-2725-29-8 |language=Persian}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bon>\"{{cite book |author =Marcel Bon |title=The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North-Western Europe |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |year=1987 |page=278 |isbn=0-340-39935-X }}\"</ref>\n\n<ref name=Courtecuisse>{{cite book |author =Courtecuisse, R. |author2 =Duhem, B. |last-author-amp =yes |title=Guide des champignons de France et d'Europe |publisher=Delachaux et Niestl\u00e9 |year=1994 |page=258 |isbn=2-603-00953-2}}  Also available in English.</ref>\n\n<ref name=Dem04>{{cite journal|vauthors=Demirel K, Uzun Y, Kaya A |year=2004 |title=Some Poisonous Fungi of East Anatolia |journal=Turk J Bot |volume=28 |pages=215\u201319 |url=http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/botany/issues/bot-04-28-1-2/bot-28-1-2-23-0207-2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505044124/http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/botany/issues/bot-04-28-1-2/bot-28-1-2-23-0207-2.pdf |archivedate=2005-05-05 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Genevier>{{cite journal |author =Genevier L.

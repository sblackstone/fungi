Baker waxy cap''', the '''brown almond waxy cap''' or the '''tawny almond waxy cap''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the [[Hygrophoraceae]] family. It is characterized by its medium to large, relatively slender-statured [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] with an almond odor, and growth often on or near rotting [[conifer]] wood. The slimy [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is brown in the center and [[cream (color)|cream]] to white near its curved edges. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] and the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] are white, and in moist environments are often covered with droplets of a translucent liquid. The mushroom is known only from the United States, where it is common in [[coniferous forest]]s throughout the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was initially collected in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State on [[Mount Baker]], a volcano. Although [[edible mushroom|edible]], the mushroom is not considered to be of high quality.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically by American mycologists [[Alexander H. Smith]] and [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler]] in a 1942 publication. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''bakerensis'' refers to [[Mount Baker]], a volcano in the [[North Cascades]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State in the United States, where the mushroom was first collected.<ref name=Smith1942/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known by various names, including the \"Mt. Baker waxy cap\",<ref name=Ammirati1987/> the \"brown almond waxy cap\",<ref name=Arora1986/> and the \"tawny almond waxy cap\".<ref name=Bessette1997/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Hygrophorus bakerensis crop 6613.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The cap margin is rolled inward, and the gills are closely spaced. Characteristically, this young specimen has droplets of a clear liquid beaded on the margin, gills, and upper stem.]]\n\nYoung [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''H.&nbsp;bakerensis'' have rounded [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s with cottony margins that are rolled inward; as the mushrooms mature the caps flatten out and the margins may lift upward. The diameter of the cap reaches between {{convert|4|and|15|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The center of the cap is colored yellow-brown, [[tawny (color)|tawny]] or [[amber (color)|amber]], reducing to nearly white at the margin. The cap surface is slimy when wet, and sticky as it gets older and dries out. Beneath the slime layer are hairs that are plastered tightly to the surface, which clump together a few at a time to form many little streaks. The firm white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the cap is thick\u2014{{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=in}} near the stem attachment\u2014and tapers evenly to the margin. It does not change color when cut or bruised. It has a mild taste and a characteristic fragrant odor that resembles [[almond]]s,<ref name=Hesler1963/> or \"crushed peach pits\".<ref name=Arora1986/> The waxy [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[decurrent]] or [[adnation|bluntly attached]] to the stem. The gill spacing is close to subdistant\u2014between 56\u201388 individual gills reach the stem, with 2\u20133 tiers of short lamellulae (shorter gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The gills have even edges, and are narrow but become broad in large caps (8\u201312&nbsp;mm), ranging in color from creamy white to pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]].<ref name=Hesler1963/> They do not discolor when they are bruised. Young specimens often have drops of a clear liquid beaded on the gills. The gills of dried specimens darken considerably.<ref name=Smith1975/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|7|to|14|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|0.8|to|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick at the apex, solid (i.e., not hollow), and either equal in width throughout or narrowed downward. Its color is white to pale pinkish-buff, with a dry surface. The top portion of young specimens have a cottony, fine whitish powder near the top, but this sloughs off as it matures. Like the gills, the top of the stem is often beaded with drops of translucent liquid in moist weather.<ref name=Hesler1963/>\n\nThe [[basidiospore|spores]] are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, and measure 7\u20139 by 4.5\u20135&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are yellowish when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are four-spored, and measure 40\u201354 by 6\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m. There are no [[cystidia]] on the gill faces or edges.<ref name=Hesler1963/> The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is an ixotrichoderm\u2014a layer of gelatinized tissue where the distal portion of the filamentous [[hypha]]e are different lengths and the hyphae themselves are arranged perpendicular to the surface; this layer of gelatinous hyphae is between 100 and 250&nbsp;\u00b5m thick. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of the cuticle and the gill tissue.<ref name=Hesler1963/>\n\n===Edibility===\nThe mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but considered \"low-quality\".<ref name=Ammirati2009/> Smith does not recommend the mushroom for consumption, noting \"I have been informed by a number of collectors that the species is edible, but many of them thought it was a ''Clitocybe'' or a ''Tricholoma''!\".<ref name=Smith1975/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| image1 = Hygrophorus discoideus 111565.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (120 * 1182 / 1055) round 0}}\n| caption1 = ''H. discoideus''\n| image2 = Hygrophorus tennesseensis 124474.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (120 * 4927 / 2690) round 0}}\n| caption2 = ''H. tennesseensis''\n}}\n''[[Hygrophorus variicolor]]'' is very similar in overall appearance, differing only in having a stem made slimy by a gelatinous [[partial veil]].<ref name=Ammirati2009/> ''[[Hygrophorus tennesseensis|H.&nbsp;tennesseensis]]'' is another lookalike species, but has a [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] odor (like raw potatoes) and a bitter taste.<ref name=McKnight1987/> ''[[Hygrophorus arbustivus|H.&nbsp;arbustivus]]'' is a European species found under [[oak]]s. The \"clay waxy cap\" (''[[Hygrophorus discoideus|H.&nbsp;discoideus]]'') is another lookalike European species; there is a North American equivalent ''H.&nbsp;discoideus'' var. ''californius'' found at high elevations in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].<ref name=\"urlHygrophorus discoideus var. californicus\"/> Other North American species of ''Hygrophorus'' with an odor of almonds include ''[[Hygrophorus agathosmus|H.&nbsp;agathosmus]]'' (which has a gray cap), ''[[Hygrophorus monticoloa|H.&nbsp;monticola]]'' (larger spores), and ''[[Hygrophorus vinicolor|H.&nbsp;vinicolor]]'' (which has larger spores and an unpleasant taste).<ref name=\"urlPNKC\"/> ''[[Collybia oregonensis]]'' has a similar coloration and odor, but has [[adnexed gills|adnexed]] or notched and non-waxy gills.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Hygrophorus bakerensis'' is an [[Mycorrhiza#Types of mycorrhizal associations|ectomycorrhizal]] species,<ref name=Trudell2004/> and forms a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with compatible [[host (biology)|host]] plant by forming a sheath around their root tips. In this way, the fungus gains carbon and other essential organic substances from the tree and in return helps the trees take up water, [[mineral salt]]s and metabolites. It can also fight off parasites and predators such as [[nematode]]s and soil [[pathogen]]s. Associated tree species include [[Douglas-fir]].<ref name=Barroetavena12007/> The fruit bodies of ''H.&nbsp;bakerensis'' grow scattered, clustered, or in groups on the forest floor under conifers. They are common at elevations of {{convert|1000|to|4000|ft|abbr=on}} throughout the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the United States and the northern [[Rocky Mountains]], and have been collected from [[California]], [[Idaho]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Oregon]].<ref name=Hesler1963/><ref name=Orr1979/> It has been found as far north as [[Hazelton, British Columbia]]<ref name=Durall1999/> east to [[Quebec]], Canada.<ref name=\"urlwww.mycoquebec.org\"/> Fruit bodies typically appear from September to December,<ref name=Hesler1963/> and they can be very common.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==See also==\n[[List of Hygrophorus species|List of ''Hygrophorus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Ammirati1987>{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati JF, McKenny M, Stuntz DE |title=The New Savory Wild Mushroom |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle, Washington |year=1987 |pages=60\u20131 |isbn=0-295-96480-4}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ammirati2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati J, Trudell S |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest: Timber Press Field Guide (Timber Press Field Guides) |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, Oregon |year=2009 |page=67 |isbn=0-88192-935-2}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=126 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Barroetavena12007>{{cite journal |vauthors=Barroetave\u00f1a C, C\u00e1zares E, Rajchenberg M |year=2007 |title=Ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir: a comparison of species richness in native western North American forests and Patagonian plantations from Argentina |journal=Mycorrhiza |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=355\u201373 |pmid=17345105 |doi=10.1007/s00572-007-0121-x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette1997>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms of Northeastern North America |vauthors=Bessette A, Bessette AR, Fischer DW |year= 1997|publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |isbn=978-0-8156-0388-7 |page=136 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2uU12XcRD4C&pg=PA136}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Durall1999>{{cite journal |title=Species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi in cutblocks of different sizes in the Interior Cedar-Hemlock forests of northwestern British Columbia: sporocarps and ectomycorrhizae |journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research |year=1999 |vauthors=Durall DM, Jones MD, Wright EF, Kroeger P, Coates KD |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=1322\u201332 |doi=10.1139/cjfr-29-9-1322}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hesler1963>{{cite book |title=North American species of ''Hygrophorus'' |vauthors=Hesler LR, Smith AH |year=1963 |publisher=The University of Tennessee Press |location=Knoxville, Tennessee |pages=371\u20133 |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=fung1tc;cc=fung1tc;idno=ajn5962.0001.001;q1=bakerensis;view=image;seq=387;size=100;page=root}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=McKnight1987>{{cite book |vauthors=McKnight VB, McKnight KH |title=A Field Guide to Mushrooms: North America |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Massachusetts |year=1987 |page=212 |isbn=0-395-91090-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSdA3V7Z9WcC&pg=PA212}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Orr1979>{{cite book |vauthors=Orr DB, Orr RT |title=Mushrooms of Western North America |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1979 |page=215 |isbn=0-520-03656-5}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Smith1942>{{cite journal |title=Studies in North American species of ''Hygrophorus'' \u2013 II |journal=Lloydia |year=1942 |vauthors=Smith AH, Helser LR |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201394}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Smith1975>{{cite book |author=Smith AH. |title=A Field Guide to Western Mushrooms |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |year=1975 |page=68 |isbn=0-472-85599-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7eXGZQG7ksC&pg=PA109}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Trudell2004>{{cite journal |title=Patterns of nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios in macrofungi, plants and soils in two old-growth conifer forests |journal=New Phytologist |year=2004 |vauthors=Trudell SA, Rygiewicz PT, Edmonds RL |volume=164 |issue=2 |pages=317\u201335 |jstor=1514774 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01162.x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlHygrophorus discoideus var. californicus\">{{cite web |url=http://mushroomhobby.com/Gallery/Hygrophorus/Hygrophorus%20discoideus%20var.%20californicus/ |title=''Hygrophorus discoideus'' var.

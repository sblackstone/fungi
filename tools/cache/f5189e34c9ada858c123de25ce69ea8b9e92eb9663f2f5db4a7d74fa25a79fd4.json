It is difficult to distinguish from other related species firstly because it is variable, secondly because the taxonomic criteria are often based on characteristics which have later been found to be variable, and thirdly because there is much disagreement between authorities as to exactly how the species should be defined.\n\n==Description==\n\n*'''Cap''': 3.5 \u2013 8&nbsp;cm, low convex, often with a low umbo, smooth, dark brown fading to greyish brown.\n*'''Gills''': Whitish, crowded, emarginately attached to stipe.\n*'''Stipe''': Up to 10&nbsp;cm long and typically 1&nbsp;cm thick, similarly coloured to the cap but lighter, with longitudinal fibres.\n*'''Spores''': 6.5 - 8.5 x 5 - 6 [[\u00b5m]], elliptical with amyloid warts (staining blue in [[Melzer's reagent]]), spore print white.\n*'''Odor''': Faint.\n*'''Microscopic features''': May have [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] [[cheilocystidia]] or they may be missing (see below in taxonomy section).\n*'''Habitat''': Grassy places in woods, roadsides, heathland etc.\n\nThis description is taken from several references, which generally agree except on microscopic features.<ref name=Bon/><ref name=FAN/><ref name=FN/><ref name=KR/><ref name=Kuo/>\n\nDue partly to the confused taxonomic definitions, this mushroom is very difficult to identify with certainty.  Various authorities imply that around ''M. melaleuca'' there is a complex of closely related species without clear dividing lines, and that the current analysis (which varies from one author to another) requires more clarification.<ref name=FAN/><ref name=FN/><ref name=KR/>  Much of the taxonomic work on ''Melanoleuca'' has been done in Europe and the status of North American specimens is less certain.<ref name=Kuo/>  However a 2012 paper by Vizzini et al. proposes updated definitions based on DNA analysis and suggests that some progress on these issues is being made.<ref name=Vizzini/>\n\n==Taxonomy and Related Species==\nBoth the species name ''melaleuca'' and the genus name ''Melanoleuca'' come from the same Ancient Greek words for black (\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 - melas) and white (\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd - leukon).<ref name=Liddell1/><ref name=Liddell2/>  The species name was originated by the Swedish mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon|Persoon]] in his 1801 publication ''Synopsis Methodica Fungorum'',<ref name=Persoon1801/> as ''Agaricus melaleucus''.  This formed the basis for the genus name ''Melanoleuca'' which was invented by [[Narcisse Th\u00e9ophile Patouillard]] in 1897 as a variant of ''Melaleuca''.<ref name=Patouillard2/>\n\nThe underside of the cap is whitish, and the top of the cap and the stem are often quite a dark brown, but \"black and white\" is not a very accurate description in practice.\n\nThe species names of common animals are often identical to their genus names (as with ''[[Rattus rattus]]'' or ''[[Bufo bufo]]''), but this form of designation (known as a [[tautonym]]) is forbidden for plants and fungi by the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|International Code of Nomenclature]].<ref name=Nomenclature1/>  ''Melanoleuca melaleuca'' narrowly circumvents this rule.\n\nPatouillard had originally named the genus ''Melaleuca'' in 1887 and called the type species ''Melaleuca vulgaris'', presumably to avoid a tautonym.<ref name=Patouillard1/>  In 1897 Patouillard changed the name of the genus to ''Melanoleuca''.<ref name=Patouillard2/>  According to modern nomenclatural rules, the older genus name should normally take precedence, but an exception has been made by the [[International Botanical Congress]] and ''Melanoleuca'' has been declared a ''[[nomen conservandum]]'', that is, a name which is to be considered valid irrespective of the rules of precedence.<ref name=Nomenclature2/>\n\nThe American mycologist [[William Murrill]] devised the name ''Melanoleuca melaleuca'' in a 1911 article in the journal ''[[Mycologia]]''.<ref name=Murrill1911/>  If that is a valid name, again following modern rules, it should take precedence over ''Melanoleuca vulgaris'' as it refers to the original species name ''melaleucus''.  But in any case, Species Fungorum gives ''M. vulgaris'' as a synonym of ''M. polioleuca'', rather than of ''M. melaleuca'' (see below),<ref name=IF1/> and Bon implies that ''M. vulgaris'' is equivalent to only part of ''M. melaleuca''.<ref name=Bon/>\n\nIn certain treatments of the genus, including Funga Nordica<ref name=FN/> and Flora Agaricina Neerlandica,<ref name=FAN/> ''M. melaleuca'' is defined as having no [[cheilocystidia]], but molecular analysis by Vizzini et al. makes it clear that these cystidia may sometimes appear and sometimes be missing in the same species of ''Melanoleuca'', implying that this feature should not be used to characterize the mushroom.<ref name=Vizzini/>  Other treatments specify ''M. melaleuca'' as having [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] cheilocystidia, but recognize a separate closely related species, ''Melanoleuca graminicola'' as having no cheilocystidia.<ref name=KR/><ref name=Kuo/><ref name=Moser/>  According to [[Index Fungorum]] the latter is a valid current name,<ref name=IF3/> but the former two references consider ''M. graminicola'' to be a synonym of ''M. melaleuca''.\n\nAccording to its definition (which is admitted to be in need of revision), Funga Nordica also lists ''Melanoleuca brachyspora'', ''Melanoleuca brevispora'', ''Melanoleuca robertiana'' and ''Melanoleuca stridula'' as synonyms of ''M. melaleuca''.<ref name=FN/>\n\nThe older treatments use various characteristics to delimit the species, for instance Moser distinguishes ''M. melaleuca'' as not having a [[pruinose]] cap, with a long stem in relation to the cap diameter, having a dark brownish cap colour, with stem not coarsely striate, and having white stem flesh.\n\nAnother species which has been confused with ''M. melaleuca'' is ''Melanoleuca polioleuca''.  In Species Fungorum (the part of Index Fungorum which evaluates current names), apart from the valid entry of ''M. melaleuca'', there is an invalid one designated \"''Melanoleuca melaleuca sensu'' NCL\"<ref name=sensuNCL/> which is said to be equivalent to the current ''M. polioleuca''.<ref name=IF2/>  According to Courtecuisse, ''M. polioleuca'' is distinguished by having a dense white \"pruina\" (a powdery covering) on the stem and by the flesh inside the stem being dark cinnamon rather than pale.<ref name=Courtecuisse/>\n\n==General==\nThis species is reported to be [[edible mushroom|edible]].<ref name=KR/><ref name=Moser/>  The confusion described in the previous section does not imply any particular culinary danger because (as far as is known) the closely related species are also edible.<ref name=Bon/>\n\nIt is a widely distributed species, known from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and Oceania.<ref name=Zhishu1993/>\n\nLike all ''Melanoleuca'' it is [[saprophytic]], feeding on organic litter and not being associated with particular types of tree.<ref name=FN/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Bon>Bon states that all species of ''Melanoleuca'' seem to be edible in \"{{cite book |author=Marcel Bon |title=The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North-Western Europe |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |year=1987 |page=164 |isbn=0-340-39935-X }}\"</ref>\n\n<ref name=Courtecuisse>{{cite book |author1=Courtecuisse, R.  |author2=Duhem, B.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Guide des champignons de France et d'Europe |publisher=Delachaux et Niestl\u00e9 |year=1994 |page=204 |isbn=2-603-00953-2}}  Also available in English.</ref>\n\n<ref name=FAN>See \"{{cite book |author=C.

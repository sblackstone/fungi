Found in Asia, Europe, and North America, it produces small orangish to reddish inedible [[mushroom]]s with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|1.2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, held by thin pinkish-white [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] reaching {{convert|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long. The fungus prefers to grow in [[coniferous forest|conifer woods]] and [[peat bogs]], suggesting a preference for acidic environments. The appearance of several atypical fruitings of ''Mycena adonis'' on [[deciduous]] wood in the Netherlands in the late 1970s was attributed to increases in [[atmospheric pollution]] that raised the acidity of the wood [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. Mushrooms resembling ''M.&nbsp;adonis'' include ''[[Mycena acicula|M.&nbsp;acicula]]'', ''[[Mycena aurantiidisca|M.&nbsp;aurantiidisca]]'', and ''[[Mycena rosella|M.&nbsp;rosella]]''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first named ''Agaricus adonis'' in 1792 by [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard]],<ref name=Bulliard1792/> and placed in ''[[Mycena]]'' by [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] in 1821.<ref name=Gray1821/> [[Rolf Singer]] successively moved it to  ''[[Hemimycena]]'' (1943),<ref name=Singer1943/> then ''[[Marasmiellus]]'' (1951).<ref name=Singer1951/> Singer later changed his mind about these placements, and his 1986 ''Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'', he considered the species a ''Mycena'';<ref name=Singer1986/> the [[binomial nomenclature|binomials]] resulting from the prior generic transfers are [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].<ref name=\"urlMycoBank\"/>\n\nThe mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"scarlet bonnet\".<ref name=\"urlBMS CommonNames\"/> [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] called it the \"Adonis high-stool\" in his 1821 ''Natural Arrangement of British Plants'',<ref name=Gray1821/> while [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]] named it the \"delicate Mycena\".<ref name=Cooke1871/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mycena adonis 46238.jpg|thumb|left|The gills are interspersed with two or three tiers of short gills.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] initially has a sharply conic shape, but expands to a narrow bell-shape or a broad cone in maturity, typically reaching {{convert|0.5|to|1.2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The cap margin, which is initially pressed against the stem, is opaque or nearly so at first. It is scarlet red when fresh and moist, becoming orange or yellowish orange before losing moisture. The mushroom is [[hygrophanous]], and fades to an orange [[buff (color)|buff]] color when dry. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, the same color as the cap, fragile, and without any distinctive taste or odor. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are ascending-adnate (the gills attach at much less than a right angle, appearing to curve upward toward stem) or attached by a tooth, subdistant to close, with 14\u201316 gills reaching the stem. Additionally, there are two or three tiers of lamellulae\u2014short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem. The gills are narrow, and yellowish or with a reddish tinge at first; the margins are paler and the same color as the faces. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|2|\u2013|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|\u2013|2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and roughly equal in width throughout. It is tubular, fragile, initially [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (covered with a fine powder), polished and smooth with age, pale yellow, becoming whitish, with the base often dirty yellow or brownish.<ref name=\"Smith p.177-78\"/> ''Mycena adonis'' mushrooms are inedible.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are narrowly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], [[nonamyloid]], and measure 6\u20137 by 3\u20133.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 20\u201322 by 6\u20137&nbsp;\u03bcm. The [[wikt:cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] and [[wikt:pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] ([[cystidium|cystidia]] found on the edges and faces, respectively, of the gills) are abundant and similar in shape and markings, 40\u201358 by 10\u201315&nbsp;\u03bcm, tapering somewhat on either end and usually with a long needle-shaped neck (which is branched in some). The cystidia are generally smooth, but when dried material is mounted in [[potassium hydroxide]] for observation under light microscopy, an amorphous substance apparently holds spores and debris around the neck or apex, making them appear encrusted. The flesh of the gill is very faintly [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]-brown when [[staining|stained]] in [[iodine]]. The cap flesh has a thin, poorly differentiated pellicle with a region of slightly enlarged cells beneath it; the remainder is filamentous, and the filamentous portion stains vinaceous-brown in iodine.<ref name=\"Smith p.177-78\">Smith, pp. 177\u201378.</ref>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Mycena acicula 85767.jpg|thumb|130px|right|''M. acicula'' is smaller than ''M.&nbsp;adonis'', and has a deep orange-red cap.]]\nThere are several other mycenas with which ''Mycena adonis'' could be confused. {{species|M|ycena|acicula}} is typically a smaller mushroom with a deep orange-red cap rather than the typical bright salmon-pink color of ''M.&nbsp;adonis''. Since the colors and sizes of ''M.&nbsp;acicula'' and ''M.&nbsp;adonis'' are similar, a microscope is needed to reliably distinguish between them, with spore size and shape being different. {{species|M|ycena|strobilinoides}} can be distinguished from ''M.&nbsp;adonis'' by its orange cap and amyloid spores. {{species|M|ycena|aurantiidisca}} can be distinguished from ''M.&nbsp;adonis'' by it lack of scarlet to pinkish tones in the cap and lack of gelatinized cortical hyphae. ''[[Mycena oregonensis]]'' is differentiated from ''M.&nbsp;adonis'' by its orange to yellow cap and lack of scarlet to pinkish tones.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena adonis\"/> ''[[Mycena roseipallens|M.&nbsp;roseipallens]]'' has a smaller [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruit body]], wider spores, a less intensely colored and less conical cap, and grows on the decaying wood of elm, ash, and alder.<ref name=Smith1936/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\nThe fruit bodies of ''Mycena adonis'' grow solitarily or in groups in [[conifer]] forests, and appear in the spring and autumn.  The fruit bodies grow in groups or scattered on needle beds under [[spruce]] and [[Tsuga|hemlock]] in the wet coastal [[temperate coniferous forest|conifer forests]], or in the higher mountains, where it is not uncommon in the spring and autumn months. In one instance, fruit bodies were found growing on the deciduous trees Spanish Maple (''[[Acer granatense]]'') and willow (''[[Salix alba]]'') near [[Amsterdam]], Holland. It was hypothesized that the bark of these trees had become more acid in recent years because of increasing [[atmospheric pollution]] (specifically, increases in the levels of [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]] from industrial smoke), providing a more suitable [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] for the fungus.<ref name=Reijnders1977/>\n\nThe fungus is found in western North America,<ref name=Miller2006/> and in 2007, it was reported from the valley of the [[Ussuri River]] in the northeast of China.<ref name=Bau2007/> It is also found in Europe (Britain,<ref name=Kew1913/> Germany,<ref name=Straus1959/> Holland<ref name=Reijnders1977/> Scotland<ref name=Kirk1984/>) and the [[Canary Islands]].<ref name=Dennis1990/> ''Mycena'' specialist [[Alexander H.

It produces a small, fan- or spoon-shaped [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruit body]] with a flat, wavy or lobed cream to yellow colored \"head\" raised on a white to cream stalk. The height is usually approximately {{convert|2|\u2013|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and up to {{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The fungus fruits on the ground in mosses, [[forest floor|forest]] duff or [[humus]], and fruit bodies may occur singly, in large groups, or in [[fairy ring]]s. The [[spore]]s produced by the fungus are needle-like, and up to {{convert|95|um |abbr=off |lk=in}} long. Several [[variety (botany)|varieties]] have been described that differ largely in their microscopic characteristics. ''S.&nbsp;flavida'' has been described by authorities variously as inedible, of unknown edibility, or [[edible mushroom|edible]] but tough.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] in 1774 by the German botanist [[Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer]]. Schaeffer gave it the [[binomial name|binomial]] ''Elvella clavata'', and called it ''Der keulenf\u00f6rmige Faltenschwamm'' (\"the club-shaped wrinkled sponge\") in the [[common name|vernacular]].<ref name=Schaeffer1774/> In 1794, [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] published ''Spathularia flavida'' as a ''[[nomen novum]]'' (new replacement name),<ref name=Persoon1794/> as Schaeffer's published name was not [[correct name (botany)|legitimate]]. [[Elias Fries]] [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] this name in the first edition of his ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'' (1821).<ref name=Fries1821/> According to the taxonomical database [[MycoBank]],<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Spathularia flavida\"/> additional [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]] include ''Boletus elvela'' as defined by [[August Johann Georg Karl Batsch]] in 1783, and ''Spathularia clavata'' published by [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] in 1889. In a 1955 publication, American mycologist [[Edwin Butterworth Mains]] considered [[Charles Horton Peck]]'s 1903 ''Mitruliopsis flavida''<ref name=Peck1903/> to be the same species as ''S.&nbsp;flavida''.<ref name=Mains1955/>\n\nThe mushroom is [[common name|commonly known]] as the \"yellow earth tongue\", \"yellow fan\",<ref name=MycoKey/><ref name=\"urlBMS common names\"/> of \"fairy fan\".<ref name=Arora1986/> [[Samuel Frederick Gray|Samuel Gray]] called it the \"yellowish spatula-stool\" in his 1821 ''Natural Arrangement of British plants''.<ref name=Gray1821/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''flavida'' is [[Latin]] for \"blonde\" or \"golden yellow\".<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Spathularia flavida.jpg|thumb|right|Fruit bodies growing in moss. Found in coniferous forest, [[Dospat]] region, [[Bulgaria]]]]\n\nThe fan- or spoon-shaped fruit bodies of ''S.&nbsp;flavida'' may be up to {{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} high, although a range between {{convert|2|\u2013|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} is more typical.<ref name=Healy2008/> Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced with the \"head\" split into two separate lobes.<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> The color is light to strong yellow, the flattened [[hymenium|fertile area]] at times paler; the color tends to deepen with the age of the fruit body. The fertile area (the region that produces spores) is often irregularly wrinkled and sometimes notched at apex, and is up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide; it tapers down the length of either side of the stem (i.e., [[decurrent]]ly) from a half to a third of the total stem length.<ref name=Healy2008/> The division between the head and the stem is sharply defined.<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is hollow, smooth ([[glabrousness (botany)|glabrous]]), and has a white to yellowish [[mycelium]] at its base.<ref name=TyluktiVI1979/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the fruit body is whitish, but becomes yellowish-brown when dry.<ref name=Sesli1998/>\n\nThe [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of ''Spathularia flavida'' is variously described as untested,<ref name=Jordan2004/> unknown,<ref name=Bessette1997/> or \"edible, but rather tough\".<ref name=Arora1986/> The small size would likely discourage table use. The odor and taste are not distinctive.<ref name=TyluktiVI1979/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n\nIn [[spore print|mass]], the [[ascospore|spores]] appear yellowish-brown, especially  when they are dry. Viewed under the [[light microscope|microscope]], they appear [[hyaline]] (translucent).<ref name=Arora1986/> The spores are variable in size, but typically in the range of 30\u201395 by 1.5\u20132.5&nbsp;\u00b5m. They may be non-or several [[septum|septate]], slender and pointed ([[wikt:acicular|acicular]]), and have an outer wall with a gelatinous layer.<ref name=Mains1955/> The [[ascus|asci]] (the spore-bearing structures) are club-shaped, with dimensions of 85\u2013125 by 8\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m. The asci do not have a covering lid known as an operculum. The [[paraphyses]] (sterile cells found in the [[hymenium]]) are filamentous, and [[hyaline]] (translucent); some are ring-shaped ([[wikt:circinate|circinate]]).<ref name=TyluktiVI1979/>\n\n===Variants===\n\nMains described a number of [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of ''S.&nbsp;flavida'' based largely on differences in the shapes and sizes of their spores. All varieties were described from collections made in the United States.<ref name=Mains1955/>\n\n* ''S. flavida'' var. ''flavida''\n: In the typical variety, spores range in size from 40\u201362&nbsp;\u00b5m (although a smaller range of 45\u201356&nbsp;\u00b5m is most typical) by 2\u20132.5&nbsp;\u00b5m; the paraphyses are either slightly branched above or not at all, and are curved to circinate at their apices.\n* ''S. flavida'' var. ''tortuosa''\n: In this variety, the paraphyses are more curved to circinate and twisted at the apices, and often form a dense intertwined layer above the asci.\n* ''S. flavida'' var. ''ramosa''\n: The spores are smaller than the typical variety, usually 39\u201342 by 1.5\u20132&nbsp;\u00b5m; the paraphyses are irregularly branched on the upper portion. Fruit bodies in this variety are club-shaped and flattened compared to the typical tongue-shape of the typical variety.\n* ''S. flavida'' var. ''brevispora''\n: This variety, common in [[Michigan]], has spores that are 32\u201340 by 2&nbsp;\u00b5m.\n* ''S. flavida'' var. ''longispora''\n: Variety ''longispora'' is known from the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It has spores that are 55\u201375 by 2\u20132.5&nbsp;\u00b5m, and paraphyses that are similar to the typical variety.<ref name=Mains1955/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| header = Lookalike species\n| align = right\n| image1 = Microglossum rufum 1.jpg\n| width1 = 120\n| caption1 = ''[[Microglossum rufum]]''\n| image2 = Neolecta irregularis 76559.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (120 * 4470 / 3119) round 0}}\n| caption2 = ''[[Neolecta irregularis]]''\n| image3 = Spathulariopsis velutipes 163664.jpg\n| width3 = {{#expr: (120 * 3648 / 2736) round 0}}\n| caption3 = ''[[Spathulariopsis velutipes]]''\n}}\n\n''Spathularia flavida'' may be distinguished from the velvet-foot fairy fan (''[[Spathulariopsis velutipes]]'') by differences in the stem: ''S.&nbsp;velutipes'' is fuzzy and brown rather than smooth and yellowish.<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> The fuzziness is a result of a thin layer of intertwined [[hypha]]e that cover the stem, which project short hyphae outward from the surface.<ref name=Mains1955/> The closely related species ''[[Spathularia neesi|S.&nbsp;neesi]]'' has an [[ochre]] color,<ref name=Tynaldo1985/> spores that measure 60\u201380 by 1.5\u20132&nbsp;\u00b5m, and paraphyses that are branched on the upper parts.<ref name=Mains1955/> ''[[Neolecta irregularis]]'' is roughly similar in appearance to ''S.&nbsp;flavida'', but lacks a sharply differentiated, spoon-shaped head, has a stem lighter in color than the head, and microscopically, has much smaller oval to elliptical spores that measure 5.5\u20138.5 by 3\u20134&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Evenson1997/> Another yellowish earth-tongue fungus, ''[[Microglossum rufum]]'', has a well-defined oval to spoon-shaped head, and sausage- to spindle-shaped spores that are 18\u201338 by 4\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Roody2003/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\n\nThe fruit bodies grow scattered or in groups on [[forest floor|forest]] duff or [[humus]] under [[conifer]]s, summer and fall, and may grow in [[fairy ring|rings]] or arcs. Thought to be a [[saprobic]] species (that is, obtaining nutrients from dead or decomposing [[organic matter]]),<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> it has also been found on rotten wood.<ref name=Mains1955/> The fungus is able to protect itself from [[fungivore|mycophagy]] by the [[springtail]] ''[[Ceratophysella denisana]]'', a common mushroom feeder, by releasing repellent odorous compounds when it is injured.<ref name=Nakamori2006/>\n\nA [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] and widespread species, ''S.&nbsp;flavida'' is common in [[temperate]] regions such as the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America,<ref name=TyluktiVI1979/><ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> extending north to Alaska;<ref name=Laursen2009/> it is, however, unknown in Mexico.<ref name=Guzman1973/> In Europe, it has been collected from Britain,<ref name=Jordan2004/> Germany,<ref name=Dorfelt2003/> Spain,<ref name=Llimona1975/> Austria, Belgium, [[Scandinavia]], and Italy;<ref name=Cooke1879/> in Asia, it has been reported from India<ref name=Thind1970/> Japan,<ref name=Nakamori2006/> and Turkey.<ref name=Sesli1998/> ''Spathularia flavida'' is considered a protected species in [[Slovakia]].<ref name=Kautmanova2005/> One field guide says of this species, \"that one is apt to see [it] while down on the ground looking for something else.\"<ref name=Orr1979/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |pages=871\u20132 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette1997>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms of Northeastern North America |vauthors=Bessette A, Bessette AR, Fischer DW |year=1997 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |isbn=978-0-8156-0388-7 |page=504 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2uU12XcRD4C&pg=PA504}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Cooke1879>{{cite book |author=Cooke MC. |title=Mycographia, seu icones fungorum: Figures of fungi from all parts of the world.

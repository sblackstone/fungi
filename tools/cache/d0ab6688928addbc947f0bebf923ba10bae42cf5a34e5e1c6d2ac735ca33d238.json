They all exude milky drops (lactate) from the flesh and gills when damaged. It has no common [[English names for organisms|English name]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nAccredited to [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]], one of the fathers of [[mycology]].\n\n==Description==\nIt is distinguishable mainly by its pinkish-buff gills and rosy markings on the upper [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] surface, often arranged in concentric rings. Like other fungi in the genus, it has crumbly, rather than fibrous, flesh, and when this is broken the fungus exudes a white milky liquid. Mature specimens are funnel-shaped, with [[decurrent gills]] and a concave [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]. It has firm, tough flesh, and a [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] which is shorter than the fruitbody is wide. The [[spore print]] is creamy-pink in colour.\n\n''L. controversus'' is similar to several white milk-caps in the genus ''[[Lactifluus]]'' which however are only distantly related: The 'fleecy milk-cap' ''[[Lactifluus vellereus]]'', its sister species ''[[Lactifluus bertillonii|Lf. bertillonii]]'', and the 'peppery milk-cap' ''[[Lactifluus piperatus|Lf. piperatus]]'' all lack the pinkish gills and 'rosy' [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] markings.\n[[File:Lact.cont(2).jpg|left|thumb|200px|Underside, showing pinkish gills.]]\n[[File:Lact.cont(3).jpg|left|thumb|200px|Close up showing rosy cap markings]]\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nIt is found in [[Great Britain|Britain]], and [[Europe]], and usually grows with species of [[Salix]] (Goat willow or Creeping willow) on heaths and moors. It is uncommon.<ref name=\"Phillips06\">{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref> It is widespread in [[North America]] growing with [[aspen]], [[Populus|poplar]], and [[willow]].

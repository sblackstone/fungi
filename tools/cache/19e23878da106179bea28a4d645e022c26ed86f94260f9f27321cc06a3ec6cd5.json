It is found in Europe and North America, where it grows on the ground among leaves in damp places, especially under [[alder]]. The small pale gray to whitish [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are usually attached to small sticks buried in the leaves and [[detritus]]. They are distinguished by their long, slender [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] that root into the ground, and by the grooved [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that reaches diameters of up to {{convert|2.2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The grayish-white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are distantly spaced, and [[adnation|adnately]] attached to the stem. ''M.&nbsp;vitilis'' contains [[strobilurin|strobilurin&nbsp;B]], a fungicidal compound with potential use in agriculture.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nFirst described as ''Agaricus vitilis'' by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838,<ref name=Fries1838/> it was assigned to ''Mycena vitilis'' in 1872 by [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]].<ref name=Quelet1872/> The white-bodied variant ''Mycena vitilis''&nbsp;var.&nbsp;''corsica'' has been described from Italy, and differs from the main species by its white fruit bodies and differing measurements for several microscopic characters.<ref name=Robish1999/> [[Carleton Rea]] named another variety ''amsegetes'' (meaning \"field by the roadside\"), which differs from the type variety by its \"obsoletely [[umbonate]]\" cap, its shorter and thicker stem, and its typical habitat of meadows and roadsides.<ref name=Rea1922/> The name \"''Mycena filopes''\" has also been confusingly applied to this species by some authors,<ref name=Polese2002/> although ''[[Mycena filopes|M.&nbsp;filopes]]'' (Bull.) P. Kumm. is a species that is recognized as being distinct from ''M.&nbsp;vitilis\".<ref name=\"urlFungorum: Mycena filopes\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''vitilis'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word for \"good for tying or binding with\",<ref name=Valpy1828/> or \"plaited\".<ref name=Rea1922/> The mushroom's [[common name]] is the \"snapping bonnet\".<ref name=BMS/> In his 1871 ''Handbook of British Fungi'', [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]] called it the \"flexile Mycena\".<ref name=Cooke1871/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mycena spec. - Lindsey 16b.jpg|thumb|left|The whitish gills are narrowly adnate.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''M.&nbsp;vitilis'' is initially conic or bell-shaped, but flattens out in maturity, and typically reaches dimensions of up to {{convert|2.2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/> When young, the cap margin is pressed against the stem, but as the cap expands it becomes bell-shaped or somewhat [[Umbo (mycology)|umbonate]], and the margin flattens out or curves inward. The cap surface is initially hoary but soon becomes polished and slimy when moist, or shiny when dry. The cap margin is even, and has slight grooves that mark the position of the gills underneath. The cap color is beige (sometimes with a grayish tinge) with paler margins, fading to pale gray or nearly white in age.<ref name=\"Smith p.288-90\"/> Occasionally, the mushroom cap has a strong brownish tint when fresh. Moist mushrooms have a slightly sticky surface.<ref name=Jordan2004/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin but pliant, grayish or pallid, [[wikt:cartilaginous|cartilaginous]], and lacks any distinctive odor and taste.<ref name=\"Smith p.288-90\"/>\n[[File:Mycena vitilis 8917.jpg|thumb|right|The portion of the stem base rooted in the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] is covered with white hairs.]]\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are attached by a tooth and are narrowly [[wikt:adnate|adnate]], close to subdistant, narrow, equal, white or grayish, and with edges [[wikt:concolorous|concolorous]] and often slightly eroded.<ref name=\"Smith p.288-90\"/> [[Miles Joseph Berkeley|Berkeley]] noted that the gills \"vary a good deal in colour, and are sometimes very dark\".<ref name=Berkeley1860/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|6|\u2013|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, equal in width throughout, cartilaginous and tough. The stem color is brown with a tinge of pink, and the color lightens towards the top.<ref name=Jordan2004/> It is usually straight but often curved toward the base, and roots into in the debris, or is attached to sticks.<ref name=\"Smith p.288-90\"/> Smith has noted that in optimal weather conditions, \"robust\" forms may be found that are \"strict and rigid in their appearance.\"<ref name=Smith1935/> The buried portion of the stem is covered with thick, stiff whitish hairs, and is surrounded with a thin subgelatinous layer, which causes it to be slimy to the touch. Its color is initially bluish-black, soon gray, nearly the same color as the cap, with the apex somewhat fibrous-striate.<ref name=\"Smith p.288-90\">Smith, pp. 288\u201390.</ref> The mushroom is inedible.<ref name=Jordan2004/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], [[hyaline]], [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and measure 9\u201311 by 5\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are not differentiated or are occasionally present near the gill edge and similar to cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge). The cheilocystidia, which measure 32\u201346 by 8\u201314&nbsp;\u03bcm, are tapered on either end and can have two to several obtuse fingerlike projections arising from the apex. The gill flesh [[staining|stains]] [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]-brown in iodine. The subhymenium (the tissue layer directly underneath the [[hymenium]]) is made of narrow, interwoven [[hypha]]e, with the central portion composed of long, cylindrical, and moderately broad cells. The flesh of the cap has a fairly thick subgelatinous [[wikt:pellicle|pellicle]], a well-differentiated hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body. All except the pellicle stain vinaceous-brown in iodine.<ref name=\"Smith p.288-90\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nThe fruit bodies of ''Mycena vitilis'' are found growing scattered or in groups on [[forest floor|debris]] in [[hardwood forest|hardwood]] or [[mixed forest|mixed]] conifer and hardwood forests. Along the [[Pacific Coast]] it is sometimes abundant in [[Red alder]] slashes. In eastern North America it is quite commonly found growing in the autumn months of October and November with ''[[Mycena semivestipes|M.&nbsp;semivestipes]]'' and ''[[Mycena pullata|M.&nbsp;pullata]]''.<ref name=\"Smith p.288-90\"/> The fungus is widely distributed in Europe (for example, Britain,<ref name=Rea1922/> Germany,<ref name=Gerhardt1990/> Italy,<ref name=Robish1999/> Norway,<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/> Poland,<ref name=RudnickaJezierska1965/> Portugal<ref name=Mendes1952/>).\n\n==Chemistry==\n[[File:Strobilurin-B-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|120px|right|Strobilurin B]]\nThe fruit bodies of ''Mycena vitilis'' contain the chlorinated compound strobilurin&nbsp;B. [[Strobilurin]]s are [[aromatic compound]]s produced by some fungi that help them secure resources by giving them an advantage against other competing fungi. They have been investigated for potential use as [[lead compound]]s for agricultural [[fungicide]]s.<ref name=Rahman2006/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Berkeley1860>{{cite book |author=Berkeley MJ. |title=Outlines of British Fungology: Containing Characters of Above a Thousand Species of Fungi, and a Complete List of All that Have Been Described as Natives of the British Isles |year=1860 |publisher=L.

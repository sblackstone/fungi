It is dark [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] (red wine-coloured) or purple, and grows with [[deciduous]], or occasionally [[coniferous]] trees. It is [[common name|commonly]] called the '''blackish purple Russula''', or the '''purple brittlegill'''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nInitially described as ''Agaricus atropurpureus'' by German naturalist [[Julius Vincenz von Krombholz|Julius von Krombholz]] in 1845, and placed in ''[[Russula]]'' by his countryman [[Max Britzelmayr]] in 1893, the binomial name of this mushroom ''R.&nbsp;atropurpurea'' (Krombh.) Britzelm is accepted as being incorrect, and mycologists cannot agree on a suitable replacement.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Phillips R | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|pages=22}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Russula atropurpurea'' appears in late summer and autumn. It is common in the northern [[temperateness|temperate]] zones, Europe, Asia, and Eastern North America, and is [[mycorrhizal]] with oak (''[[Quercus]]''),<ref name=T.Laessoe/><ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=Arora D |authorlink=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |pages=85 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref> with which it prefers to live. Favouring acid soil, it is occasionally found with beech (''[[Beech|Fagus]]''), or pine (''[[Pinus]]'').<ref name=Phillips06/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Two views of a mature Purple Brittlegill on Kaien Island.png|left|thumb|a mature Purple Brittlegill on [[Kaien Island]]]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|4|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter. It is dark reddish purple, with a dark; sometimes almost black centre. At first it is convex, but later flattens, and often has a shallow depression. It can also be lighter in colour, or mottled yellowish. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is firm, white, and turns grey with age. It measures 3\u20136&nbsp;cm in length and 1\u20132&nbsp;cm in diameter. The closely set and fairly broad [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed to almost free, and pale cream, giving a [[spore print]] of the same colour. The flesh is white; with a fruity smell, similar to apples. It tastes moderately hot.<ref name=Phillips06/>\n\nThe species ''[[Russula brunneviolacea|R.&nbsp;brunneviolacea]]'', and ''[[Russula romelli|R.&nbsp;romellii]]'' are similar, though both have darker spore prints.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Laessoe T | year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref>\n\nAs the fruitbodies mature, the caps become concave to collect water during wet weather, and much of the color washes off the rim<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/russula-atropurpurea.php|title=Russula atropurpurea, Purple Brittlegill mushroom|website=First Nature}}</ref>. \n\n==Spores==\n[[File:Russula Atropurpurea.png|left|thumb|Spores at 800x found in a field in [[Wales|Wales, United Kingdom.]]]]\nThe [[spore print]] is Whitish, and the subglobose to globose spores ornamented with warts and ridges measure 7-9 x 6-7 \u03bcm.\n\n==Edibility==\nThis mushroom is said to be the mildest of the hot-tasting ''Russula'' species. It is [[edible mushroom|edible]] if cooked, although not recommended.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Russula species|List of ''Russula'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1784190}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Russula|atropurpurea]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]"}]}}}}

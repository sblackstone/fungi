An older synonym is ''Agaricus caerulipes''.\n\nIt is in the section ''Semilanceatae'', other members of the section include ''[[Psilocybe bohemica]]'', ''[[Psilocybe callosa]]'', ''[[Psilocybe carbonaria]]'', ''[[Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa]]'', ''[[Psilocybe fimetaria]]'', ''[[Psilocybe indica]]'', ''[[Psilocybe liniformans var. liniformans]]'', ''[[Psilocybe liniformans var. americana]]'', ''[[Psilocybe pelliculosa]]'', ''[[Psilocybe semiinconspicua]]'', ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'', ''[[Psilocybe serbica]]'', ''[[Psilocybe silvatica]]'', ''[[Psilocybe subfimetaria]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe venenata]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\nFrom the Latin words {{lang|la|caerulea}} (blue) and {{lang|la|pes}} (foot).\n\n== Description ==\n''Psilocybe caerulipes'' has a [[farinaceous]] taste and a no to slightly farinaceous odor.\n*The '''[[Stipe (mycology)|cap]]''' is 1 \u2014 3.5&nbsp;cm in diameter, obtusely [[conic]] to [[wikt:convex|convex]], and the margin is initially turned inwards, later becoming broadly convex to flattened or somewhat [[umbilicate]] while retaining a slight umbo, and at times quite irregular. The surface is [[wikt:viscid|viscid]] when moist from a gelatinous [[Pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]], but soon becomes dry and shiny, translucent-striate, and decorated with fine [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] veil remnants near the margin, often with greenish stains near the margin or a greenish tinge overall. It is cinnamon brown to dingy brown when fresh, [[hygrophanous]], and soon fading to dingy [[ochraceous]] buff to cinnamon buff. The flesh is thin, pliant, bruising blue, sometimes slowly.\n*The '''[[Lamella (mycology)|gills]]''' are close to crowded, narrow with [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] to [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]] to [[wikt:uncinate|uncinate]] attachment. They are light brown at first, becoming rusty cinnamon as the spores mature; the edges are whitish and slightly fimbriate.\n*The '''[[spore]]s''' are dark purple brown, ellipsoid, 7\u201410  x 4\u20145 [[\u00b5m]] from 4-spored [[basidia]], thick-walled, and with a broad germ pore. The spores from 2-spored basidia are larger.\n*The '''[[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]''' is 3\u20136&nbsp;cm long, 1.5\u20133&nbsp;mm thick, equal to enlarging downwards, tough, and is whitish to buff at first. The stipe is pallid to bluish when dried, becoming dingy brown towards the base with age, and bruises blue, sometimes slowly. The surface is powdered at the apex, and covered with whitish to grayish [[fibril]]s downwards. The flesh is stuffed with a [[pith]] and is solid at first but becomes hollow It lacks an [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]] but sometimes remnants of the thin cortinate partial veil form a soon disappearing [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] annular zone in the upper region of the stem.\n*'''Microscopic features''': The [[basidium|basidia]] are 2- and 4-spored. [[pleurocystidium|Pleurocystidia]] are absent. The [[cheilocystidia]] are 18\u201435 x 4.5\u20147.5 [[\u00b5m]], langeniform (swollen at the base, narrowed at the top), and with a thin neck, sometimes forked, 1\u20142.5 [[\u00b5m]] broad at apices.<ref name=SmithandSinger1958>Singer R, Smith AH.

It is often overlooked as just another [[little brown mushroom]], and although widely distributed, it is not found often.

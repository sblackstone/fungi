It is found in Asia, the Caribbean, North America and Europe. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], or [[mushroom]]s, of the fungus grow on dead twigs and other woody debris of forest floors, especially along streams and other wet places. They have small orange-red [[pileus (mycology)|caps]], up to {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, held by slender yellowish [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are pale yellow with a whitish edge. Several other ''[[Mycena]]'' species look similar, but may be distinguished by differences in size and/or microscopic characteristics. ''M.&nbsp;acicula'' is considered [[edible mushroom|inedible]] because of its small size.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst named ''Agaricus acicula'' by the German scientist [[Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer]] in 1774,<ref name=Schaeffer1774/> the species was also referred to as ''Agaricus miniatus'' by another German, naturalist [[August Batsch]].<ref name=Batsch1783/> It was given its current name in 1871 by [[Paul Kummer]].<ref name=Kummer1871/> [[Rolf Singer]] transferred the species to the genera ''[[Hemimycena]]''<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Hemimycena acicula\"/> and ''[[Marasmiellus]]'',<ref name=Singer1949/> but the binomials resulting from these transfers are now considered [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].<ref name=\"urlFungorum synonymy: Mycena acicula\"/> The fungus is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Aciculae'' of the genus ''[[Mycena]]''.<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''acicula'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word meaning \"small needle\".<ref name=Headrick2001/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"orange bonnet\",<ref name=\"BritishNames\"/> or the \"coral spring Mycena\".<ref name=Roody2003/>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Mycena acicula 56572.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Close-up of pruinose (powdery) cap surface]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially convex, but as it matures, it expands to a bell-shape, typically reaching {{convert|0.3|to|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The cap sometimes has a small abrupt [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] (a central bump), and the cap margin is pressed closely against the stem when young, often flaring or curving slightly inward. As the cap expands, a narrow sterile (i.e., without any reproductive cells typical of the [[hymenium]]) band which frequently becomes lobed or irregularly-jagged often forms at the extreme margin. The cap surface is smooth, faintly translucent-[[wikt:striate|striate]] when moist, at first [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] but soon naked. The color is red when young, soon becoming yellowish toward the margin, and slowly fading to bright orange-yellow. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, brittle, yellow, and has no distinctive odor or taste.<ref name=\"Smith p.119-21\"/>\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate (with gills broadly attached to the stem, slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem) or slightly rounded next to the stem. The individual gills are close to subdistant, with between 10\u201314 reaching the stem, and two or three tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the stem). The gills are moderately broad, pale orange to whitish, often yellowish at the base and whitish along the edges. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|1|to|6|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long, and up to 1&nbsp;mm thick; [[flexuous]] (winding from side to side), brittle, with the base covered with sharp, straight, and stiff white hairs. The surface is densely white-pruinose initially, but soon becomes naked with a subsequent color shift to orange-yellow or lemon yellow.<ref name=\"Smith p.119-21\"/> This species has been described as \"a delight to behold\", but \"one usually has to get down on hands and knees to find it!\"<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\nThe fruit bodies of ''Mycena acicula'' are considered [[edible mushroom|inedible]], as they are too small and insubstantial to be considered for consumption.<ref name=Arora1986/><ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena acicula\"/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n\nThe [[basidiospore|spores]] are roughly spindle-shaped (i.e., tapering at each end), with dimensions of 9\u201311 by 3.5\u20134.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are [[nonamyloid]], meaning they do not take up [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are club-shaped, four-spored and measure 20\u201322 by 5\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m. The cheilocystidium and pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] found on the edge and face, respectively, of a gill) are similar, club-shaped to spindle-shaped or egg-shaped, and have apices that are often covered with a resinous secretion.<ref name=\"Smith p.119-21\">Smith, p.119\u201321.</ref> The [[hypha]]e that comprise the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] are up to 3.5&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, clamped, and covered with cylindrical [[wikt:excrescence|excrescences]] that measure 2\u20139 by 1\u20133&nbsp;\u00b5m.  The hyphae of the cortical layer of the stem are up to 4.5&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, [[clamp connection|clamped]], and densely covered with simple to somewhat branched, cylindrical to inflated excrescences that are up to 20 by 5&nbsp;\u00b5m. These latter excrescences are embedded in gelatinous matter.<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Mycena adonis]]'', {{species|M|ycena|floridula}}, and {{species|M|ycena|leptophylla}} are larger species belonging to the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Adonidae'' of the genus ''Mycena''. In that section, among other differences, the [[hypha]]e of the cortical layer (the outer layer of tissue) of the stem are smooth. {{species|M|ycena|oregonensis}} is similar in appearance to ''M.&nbsp;acicula'', but the cap is yellower, the gills are broadly adnate or decurrent with a short tooth, the gill edge is orange to bright yellow, and the stem is dry, not sticky. The hyphae of the cortical layer of the stem are smooth and not embedded in gelatinous matter, and in European collections the basidia are two-spored and do not have clamps. {{species|M|ycena|strobilinoides}}, a North American and European species, looks similar with its orange cap, but may be distinguished microscopically by the cheilocystidia which are densely covered by excrescences;<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/> it also has a larger cap, up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. {{species|M|ycena|aurantiidisca}} can be distinguished by the reddish-orange cap which tends to become paler at the margin.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena acicula\"/> ''Mycena'' specialist [[Alexander H. Smith]] further noted of ''M.&nbsp;acicula'' that it could readily be mistaken for a ''[[Hygrophorus]]''.<ref name=\"Smith p.119-21\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[Image:Mycena acicula 48296.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Typical growth habit]]\nThe fruit bodies of ''Mycena acicula'' grow singly, in groups, or somewhat clustered on [[forest floor|debris]] in wet places, especially along streams or the borders of swamps.  The appearance of the fruit bodies is not significantly influenced by the effect of rainfall, perhaps because \"such minute fungi are largely determined by the microenvironment prevailing under dense vegetation, etc., which is no doubt less affected by recent rain than more exposed situations.\"<ref name=ParkerRhodes1957/> The fungus is widely distributed throughout the eastern United States and Canada and occurs in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[California]] along the [[Pacific Coast]].<ref name=\"Smith p.119-21\"/> It has also been reported from [[Trinidad]],<ref name=Dennis1952/> Britain,<ref name=Rea1922/> Norway,<ref name=\"urlAronsen\"/> Spain,<ref name=Garcia1982/> Korea,<ref name=Kim1998/> and the [[Ussuri River Valley]] in the northeast of China.<ref name=Bau2007/> {{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |page=228 |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-4ajFDPlxgC&pg=PA228}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bau2007>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bau T, Bulakh YM, JianYun Z, Yu L |year=2007 |title=Agarics and other macrobasidiomycetes from Ussuri River Valley |journal=Mycosystema |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=349\u201368 |issn=1672-6472}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Batsch1783>{{cite book |title=Elenchus fungorum |author=Batsch AJGK. |year=1783 |publisher=Halae Magdeburgicae : Apud Joannem J.

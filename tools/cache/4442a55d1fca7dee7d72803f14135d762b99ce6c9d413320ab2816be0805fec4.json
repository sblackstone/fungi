Found in both [[spruce]] and mixed [[temperate coniferous forest|conifer forests]], it is a fairly common species in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America, with a northerly range extending to [[Alaska]]. Its [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are medium-sized, with velvety, brown to blackish [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|3|\u2013|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter bearing a distinct pointed [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The caps are supported by velvety [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|6|cm|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick. The mushroom oozes a whitish [[latex]] when it is cut, and injured tissue eventually turns a dull reddish color. The eastern North American and European species ''[[Lactarius lignyotus]]'' is closely similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its differing range.\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\nThe species was originally described by American mycologists [[Alexander H. Smith]] and [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler]] in a 1962 publication.<ref name=Smith1962/> Smith made the initial collection in late October 1944, in [[Rhododendron, Oregon]]. The publication also described the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''Lactarius fallax'' var. ''concolor'' based on specimens collected in [[Mount Hood]]. According to Smith and Hesler, this variety had been to that point generally identified as ''Lactarius lignyotus'' in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. They described the variety ''L.&nbsp;lignyotus'' var. ''americanus'' to account for differences such as \"spore ornamentation, distant gills at maturity, and the typically slightly acrid taste\".<ref name=Smith1962/> However, in their 1979 [[monograph]] of North American ''Lactarius'' species, they considered ''L.&nbsp;lignyotus'' var. ''americanus'' to be equivalent (and thus [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]]) to ''L.&nbsp;fallax'' var. ''concolor''.<ref name=Smith&Heslerpp139-42/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''fallax'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word \"deceptive\".<ref name=Davidson1996/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"velvety milk cap\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n''Lactarius fallax'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Plinthogalus'' of the [[subgenus]] ''Plinthogalus'' of the genus ''[[Lactarius]]''. Species in this section have brown to blackish caps, and a [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] that contains a dissolved brown [[pigment]]. The cuticle of most species is of the trichoderm type\u2014where the outermost [[hypha]]e emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface.<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1979, p. 103.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lactarius fallax 73919.jpg|thumb|left|In the main variety ''L.&nbsp;fallax'' var. ''fallax'', the gill edges are brown, similar in color to the cap.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''L.&nbsp;fallax'' is {{convert|3|\u2013|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, ranging in shape from convex to nearly flat with a small [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], expanding to plane or becoming shallowly depressed, with or without the umbo. The margin (cap edge) is even or scalloped. The cap surface is dry and velvety, finely wrinkled over the center, azonate (without concentric lines), and dark sooty brown to blackish. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are attached to subdecurrent (running shortly down the length of the stem), narrow, crowded, not forked, white at first, and become creamy [[buff (color)|buff]] with age. The edges of the gills are brown like the cap, and slowly stain [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] (redwine-colored) when bruised. There are several tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the stem) interspersed among the full-length gills. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|2.5|\u2013|6|cm|1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|8|\u2013|15|mm|1|abbr=on}} thick, nearly equal in width throughout, dry, solid, unpolished or velvety, and a paler brown than the cap. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, brittle, staining pale vinaceous. The odor is not distinctive, and the taste mild or faintly acrid. The [[latex]] is [[wikt:copious|copious]], white on exposure, unchanging, slowly staining flesh and gills vinaceous. The [[spore print]] is yellowish. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom has not been officially documented.<ref name=Bessette2009/> The species is one of several brown to nearly black milkcaps that are, according to [[David Arora]], \"notable for their beauty, and therefore likely to attract the attention of even the casual collector.\"<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\nThe [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''Lactarius fallax'' var. ''concolor'' is nearly identical to the main species in appearance and distribution, but has gill edges that are colored like the gill face.<ref name=Smith1962/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are spherical, and ornamented with warts and ridges that form a partial reticulum (a net-like pattern of lines) with prominences up to 2&nbsp;\u00b5m high. They are [[hyaline]] (translucent), [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] (meaning they will absorb [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), and measure 7.5\u201310.0 by 7\u20139.5&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a trichoderm.<ref name=Bessette2009/> The [[basidia]] (the spore-bearing cells) are 38\u201356 by 10\u201313&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, four-spored, and hyaline when mounted in a dilute solution of [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH). There are abundant [[cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] ([[cystidium|cystidia]] found on the edge of gills), with contents ranging in color from dingy yellow to hyaline in KOH. They measure 32\u201350 by 3-6&nbsp;\u00b5m, and may be shaped somewhat like a spindle (tapered on each end) or a cylinder, or they may be [[flexuous]] (winding from side to side). The pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the gill face) are [[wikt:filamentous|filamentous]], 2.5\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, and rare to scattered.<ref name=Smith1962/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Lactarius lignyotus 41556 crop.jpg|thumb|right|''L. lignyotus'' is a lookalike species found in Europe and eastern North America.]]\n''Lactarius lignyotellus'' and ''L.&nbsp;lignyotus'' are similar to ''L.&nbsp;fallax'', and they are all associated with ''[[Picea]]'' and ''[[Abies]]''; examination of microscopic features cannot be used to distinguish between them.<ref name=Bills1986/> ''L.&nbsp;lignyotus'' is restricted in distribution to eastern North America and Europe. ''[[Lactarius pseudomucidus]]'' is another milk cap with a dark brown cap, but it has a smooth (not velvety) and slimy cap and stem.<ref name=Arora1986/> Another brown-capped eastern North American species is ''[[Lactarius gerardii|L.&nbsp;gerardii]]''; it has distantly spaced white gills that run down the stem.<ref name=\"url Kuo\"/> ''[[Lactarius fuliginellus|L.&nbsp;fuliginellus]]'', which prefers to grow near [[hardwood]]s, has close gills.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nThe fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;fallax'' grow scattered to grouped together on the ground, or on very rotten [[conifer]] logs in alpine areas under standing conifers. They are fairly common, and typically found between August and October. ''L.&nbsp;fallax'' is distributed in the western United States and Canada, with the northern range extending to Alaska; the eastern range is bounded on the east by the [[Great Plains]].<ref name=Bessette2009/><ref>Hesler & Smith, 1979, p. 17.</ref> Field observations suggest that the fungus can form [[Mycorrhizae#Types of mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] associations with ''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]''.<ref name=Kropp1982/> Hesler and Smith noted that the variety ''concolor'' was prevalent under species of [[Fir]].<ref name=Smith&Heslerpp139-42/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |pages=77\u201378 |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86tM01VsFG0C&pg=PA78}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bessette2009>{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette AR, Bessette A, Harris DM |title=Milk Mushrooms of North America: A Field Guide to the Genus ''Lactarius'' |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New Yorl |year=2009 |pages=174\u201375 |isbn=978-0-8156-3229-0}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bills1986>{{cite journal |author=Bills GF. |year=1986 |title=Notes on ''Lactarius'' in the high-elevation forests of the Southern Appalachians |journal=Mycologia |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=70\u201379 |jstor=3793379 |doi=10.2307/3793379}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Davidson1996>{{cite book |vauthors=Davidson GD, Robinson M |title=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary |publisher=Chambers |location=Edinburgh |year=1996 |page=470 |isbn=978-0-550-10625-4}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kropp1982>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3792970 |vauthors=Kropp BR, Trappe JM |year=1982 |title=Ectomycorrhizal fungi of ''Tsuga heterophylla'' |jstor=3792970 |journal=Mycologia |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=479\u201388}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Smith1962>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2805252 |vauthors=Smith AH, Lesler LR |year=1962 |title=Studies on ''Lactarius''\u2013III the North American species of section Plinthogali |journal=Brittonia |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=369\u2013440 |jstor=2805252}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"url Kuo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/lactarius_gerardii.html |title=''Lactarius gerardii'' |author=Kuo M |work=MushroomExpert.Com |date=March 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n===Cited text===\n*{{cite book |title=North American Species of ''Lactarius'' |vauthors=Hesler LR, Smith AH |year=1979 |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Michigan |isbn=978-0-472-08440-1}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IndexFungorum|332885}}\n\n{{Good article}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q6468932}}\n\n[[Category:Lactarius|fallax]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1962]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Alexander H.

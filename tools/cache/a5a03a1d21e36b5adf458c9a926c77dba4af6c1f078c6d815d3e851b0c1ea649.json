The species produces small [[mushrooms]] with reddish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|6|mm|in}} in diameter and dark-brown, threadlike [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] of up to {{convert|50|mm|in}} in length. The species has a number of distinctive microscopic features, including very long [[cystidia]] on the stem, visible as bristles. Described in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi, the species grows on dead wood. The  closest relative of ''M.&nbsp;funalis'' is ''[[Marasmius liquidambari|M.&nbsp;liquidambari]]'', known from Mexico and Papua New Guinea, and it is also similar in appearance to ''[[Marasmius hudsonii|M.&nbsp;hudonii]]'' and ''[[Setulipes funaliformis]]'', the latter of which was named after ''M.&nbsp;funalis''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Marasmius funalis'' was first described and named in a 2002 article in ''[[Mycoscience]]'' by Haruki Takahashi,<ref>Takahashi 2002, p. 343</ref> based on specimens collected in 2000.<ref name=\"p348\"/> The [[Botanical name|specific name]], ''[[wiktionary:funalis|funalis]]'', is Latin for \"rope-like\", and is in reference to the shape and character of the stem.<ref name=\"p345\"/> Within the genus ''[[Marasmius]]'', the species has traits that suggest that it belongs in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Androsacei'', and, within the section, it seems most closely related to ''[[Marasmius liquidambari|M.&nbsp;liquidambari]]''. The Japanese [[common name]] for the species is {{Nihongo||\u6bdb\u7e04\u8338|Kenawatake}}.<ref name=\"p348\"/>\n\n==Description==\n{{ mycomorphbox\n| name             = ''Marasmius funalis''\n| whichGills       = adnate\n| whichGills2      = adnexed\n| capShape         = convex\n| hymeniumType     = gills\n| stipeCharacter   = bare\n| ecologicalType   = saprotrophic\n| sporePrintColor  = white\n}}\n\n''Marasmius funalis'' produces [[fruit bodies]] in the form of [[mushroom]]s. Each mushroom has a convex (sometimes completely [[hemispherical]]) [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of between {{convert|2|and|6|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in diameter. Unlike the caps of other mushrooms, it does not change shape to a flatter convex with age. The cap is fairly smooth, but can have small, parallel furrows towards the edge,<ref name=\"p345\"/> which are arranged radially.<ref>Takahashi 2002, fig. 2</ref> The colour differs slightly, depending on the age of the mushroom. While younger specimens sport reddish-brown caps, they are a paler brown in older mushrooms. The cap's surface is dry and dull, and free from hair. The threadlike [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] attaches centrally to the cap, measures from {{convert|20|to|50|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long by {{convert|0.2|to|0.5|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} thick. It is cylindrical, but may taper slightly, and is covered in short, white hairs. The base of the stem enters the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]], and there are no [[rhizomorph]]s visible. The majority of the stem is blackish-brown, but it is a lighter brown at the very top.<ref name=\"p345\">Takahashi 2002, p. 345</ref>\n\nThe white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] can be adnate or adnexed; that is, they can be attached to the stem by their whole depth, or only part of it. The individual gills are distantly spaced, with between 8 and 12 reaching the stem. Each gill is up to {{convert|0.5|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} thick, and the edges are even. There are sometimes lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the cap). There is a thin layer, up to {{convert|0.3|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} thick, of whitish flesh in the cap. It is tough, but it can be bent without breaking. The flesh has no smell or taste.<ref name=\"p345\"/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n''Marasmius funalis'' mushrooms leave a white [[spore print]]. The individual [[basidiospore]]s are [[ellipsoidal]], and measure 6.5 to 8 by 4 to 5&nbsp;[[micrometre]]s (\u03bcm). They have thin [[cell wall]]s, and they are smooth and colourless. The spores are [[inamyloid]], meaning that they do not [[staining|stain]] when they come into contact with [[iodine]] from [[Melzer's reagent]] or [[Lugol's solution]]. The spores are borne on club-shaped [[basidia]] measuring 20 to 25 by 4.5 to 7&nbsp;\u03bcm, with two spores per basidium. There are also club-shaped basidioles (under-developed basidia).<ref name=\"p345\"/>\n\nThe edge of the gill is sterile, made up of a mass of [[cystidia]] (cheilocystidia). The club-shaped cheilocystidia measure from 10 to 25 by 7 to 12&nbsp;\u03bcm, and sport multiple cylindrical appendages on their tips, measuring 1 to 7 by 1 to 1.5&nbsp;\u03bcm. The cheilocystidia are colourless, with cell walls of variable thickness, and are inamyloid. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of the gills).<ref name=\"p346\">Takahashi 2002, p. 346</ref> The caulocystidia (cystidia in the stem) measure 60 to 200 by 4 to 7&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref>Takahashi 2002, p. 347; Anton\u00edna and Buyck 2007, p. 920</ref> They are cylindrical and erect, forming the visible bristles. The tip is either pointed or rounded, and the cell walls are smooth and colourless, up to 2&nbsp;\u00b5m thick. They are dextrinoid, meaning they stain a reddish-brown when they come into contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution.<ref>Takahashi 2002, p. 347\u20138</ref>\n\nThe [[pileipellis]], the top layer of [[hyphae]] in the cap, is a [[Pileipellis#Cutis|cutis]]. The cutis is made up of cylindrical hyphae between 2 and 5&nbsp;\u00b5m thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown [[Granule (cell biology)|granule]]s. The flesh in the cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7&nbsp;\u00b5m wide with thin cell walls. They are all [[Hypha#Classification based on cell wall and overall form|generative hyphae]], and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for the fact that it is completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the [[stipitipellis]], the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5&nbsp;\u00b5m in width, with walls up to 1&nbsp;\u00b5m thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid.<ref name=\"p347\">Takahashi 2002, p. 347</ref> The flesh of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1&nbsp;\u00b5m thick. They are dextrinoid. All ''M.&nbsp;funalis'' hyphae lack [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name=\"p348\">Takahashi 2002, p. 348</ref>\n\n===Similar species===\n''Marasmius funalis'' differs from its closest relative, ''M.&nbsp;liquidambari'', due to the presence of cheilocystidia, the lack of clamp connections and the fact that the caulocystidia of ''M.&nbsp;liquidambari'' do not form bristles; instead, they are club shaped to cylindrical. The species is known from Mexico and Papua New Guinea. ''[[Marasmius hudsonii|M.&nbsp;hudonii]]'', known from Europe, is similar in appearance to ''M.&nbsp;funalis''. However, the former has a cap covered in hairs or bristles, and differs microscopically; for instance, the hyphae feature clamp connections.<ref name=\"p348\"/> The [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] species ''[[Setulipes funaliformis]]'' was named after ''M.&nbsp;funalis'' due to the [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities between the two. The species can be differentiated by the fact that the basidiospores of ''S.&nbsp;funalformis'' are slightly larger and narrower, measuring from 7 to 10 by 3.5 to 4.5&nbsp;\u03bcm, and the caulocystidia of ''M.&nbsp;funalis'' are significantly longer.<ref>Anton\u00edna and Buyck 2007, p. 920</ref>\n\n==Distribution and ecology==\n''Marasmius funalis'' is known only from [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa]] and [[Machida, Tokyo]], Japan.<ref>{{cite web | title= Marasmius funalis   | url=http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~har-takah/Marasmiusfunalis.html | publisher=Har.Takah. | accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref> Mushrooms grow in groups on dead plant matter, and have been recorded on [[Cryptomeria japonica|Japanese cedar]] (''Cryptomeria japonica'') wood and [[leaf litter]] in woodland mostly made up of [[Carpinus tschonoskii|Chonowski's hornbeam]] (''Carpinus tschonoskii'') and [[Quercus myrsinifolia|bamboo-leaf oak]] (''Quercus myrsinifolia''). The mushrooms can be encountered from May to July.<ref name=\"p348\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Marasmius species|List of ''Marasmius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite web|url= http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=375392|title= ''Marasmius funalis'' Har.

The species produces moderately sized, sturdy [[mushroom]]s of a reddish-orange colour. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], which can measure up to {{convert|70|mm|in|sigfig=1}} across, is covered in orange [[fibril]]s, and sometimes has small scales. The yellowish [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures up to {{convert|110|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in length by {{convert|8|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in width, and sometimes shows remnants of the [[partial veil]]. The mushrooms have thick [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] of a variable colour, ranging from yellow to rust but staining darker, and the yellow [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] has a mild taste. The mushrooms leave a rusty-brown [[spore print]], while the spores themselves measure from {{convert|7.5|-|11.5|\u03bcm}} in length. The species is most similar in appearance to ''[[Gymnopilus arenophilus|G.&nbsp;arenophilus]]'' and ''[[Gymnopilus fulgens|G.&nbsp;fulgens]]'', but can be differentiated from both [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]]. Despite the similarities, it is not closely related to either, suggesting [[convergent evolution]]. Instead, within the genus ''[[Gymnopilus]]'', it is most closely related to the ''spectabilis\u2013imperialis'' [[cladistics|clade]]. However, it is not particularly similar to any of its closest relatives.\n\nThe species has been found only on coastal [[sand dune]]s near [[Olbia]], in Sardinia, where it was observed growing at the base of ''[[Juncus maritimus]]'' (the sea rush), between the winter months of October and January. However, there is speculation that it may also grow elsewhere in Europe. Mushrooms were seen growing from both the sandy soil and decaying plants; however, as a [[saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic feeder]], it is possible that the species would be able to grow on other [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]]. The mushrooms grow in close groups or tight tufts.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n|clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n|label1=\n|1=\n{{clade|1=\n{{clade|1= \n{{clade|1= ''[[Gymnopilus underwoodii]]''|2=''[[Gymnopilus validipes]]''}}\n|2= ''[[Gymnopilus flavus]]''}}\n|2= {{clade|1=\n{{clade|1=''[[Gymnopilus imperialis]]''|2=''[[Gymnopilus spectabilis]]''}}\n|2= '''''Gymnopilus maritimus'''''}}}}}}|caption=[[Cladogram]] showing the [[phylogeny]] of ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' and some related species based on [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular analysis]] of sequences from [[internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] [[ribosomal DNA|rDNA]].<ref name=p201>Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos ''et al''. 2009, p. 201.</ref>}}\n''Gymnopilus maritimus'' was first described by mycologists Laura Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos (a specialist in ''[[Gymnopilus]]''<ref name=p9>Contu and Vizzini 2009, p. 9.</ref><!-- specialista messicana di Gymnopilus Laura Guzm\u00e1n-Davalos -->), Antonio Ortega, Marco Contu and Alfredo Vizzini in 2009 in an article in the journal ''[[Mycological Progress]]''.<ref name=p195/> The description was based on several specimens collected during field work by Contu in Sardinia between January 2006 and January 2007;<ref name=p200/><ref name=p195>Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos ''et al''. 2009, p. 195.</ref> the [[holotype]] was collected on 15 January 2006.<ref name=p197>Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos ''et al''. 2009, p. 197.</ref> The discovery has contributed to Sardinia's reputation as an area of mycological significance.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Macrofungi in ''Abies alba'' Miller plantation in north-western Sardinia, Italy|vauthors= Ambrosio E, Brotzu R, Lancellotti E, Franceschini A, Zotti M|journal= Micologia Italiana|volume= XLIII|issue= 1-2-3|pages=3\u201324|year= 2014}}</ref> The description was later published in Italian by Contu and Vizzini in the journal ''Micologia e Vegetazione Mediterranea'', along with the description of ''[[Gymnopilus purpureosquamulosus|G. purpuresquamulosus]]'', because the original descriptions of both of these species were in English, and difficult for non-specialists to obtain.<ref name=\"p9\"/><!-- \"Poich\u00e9 le pubblicazione aventi ad oggetto le specie in discussione sono in lingua inglese e spesso di difficile reperimento da parte dei non addetti ai lavori, abbiamo ritenuto opportuno riunire, nel presente articolo, the description annotate relative alle due specie in questione.\" --> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''[[wikt:maritimus|maritimus]]'' refers to the typical habitat of coastal [[sand dune]]s, on sandy soil or decomposing ''[[Juncus maritimus]]''.<ref name=p197/> The holotype has been deposited in the [[University of Granada]]'s herbarium.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Vizoso MT, Quesada C |title=Catalogue of type specimens of fungi and lichens deposited in the Herbarium of the University of Granada (Spain)|journal= Biodiversity Data Journal|volume=3|page=e5204|doi=10.3897/BDJ.3.e5204|pmc=4549643|year=2015|pmid=26312049}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\nWithin the genus ''Gymnopilus'', it is located in the [[subgenus]] ''Gymnopilus'' and [[section (botany)|section]] ''Macrospori''.<ref name=p195/> The subgenus ''Gymnopilus'' was proposed by [[Henri Romagnesi]] as ''Cortinatae'' (while the genus was known as ''Fulvidula'') in 1942, though the name ''Gymnopilus'' was given later by [[Rolf Singer]].

The [[basidiospore]]s can measure {{convert|7.5|-|11.5|\u03bcm}} in length, though the typical range is {{convert|8|-|10.5|\u03bcm}}. In width, they typically measure {{convert|5.5|-|7.5|\u03bcm}}, but they can be up to 8&nbsp;\u03bcm wide. In shape, they are [[ellipsoid]] or sometimes broadly ellipsoid. The top of the spore (the side where it was once attached to the [[sterigma]], the connection between the basidium and the spore) is rounded and blunt. The spores are covered with fairly large warts, measuring from {{convert|0.5|-|2|\u03bcm}} from the main spore in height. There is no [[germ pore]] or [[Plage (mycology)|plage]], and there is no clear depression around the hilum (the area where the spore was attached to the sterigma). The spores turn an orange-yellow to orange-brown colour in [[potassium hydroxide]], and turn reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent and in Lugol's iodine, but they are not [[metachromatic]].<ref name=p199/>\n\nThe four-spored [[basidia]] typically measure {{convert|24|-|35|\u03bcm}} in length by {{convert|7|-|9|\u03bcm}} in width, but can be as much as 10.5&nbsp;\u03bcm wide. They are club-shaped, but narrower in the middle. They are [[hyaline]] (translucent) and yellow to yellowish brown. The sterigmata are between 1.6 and 7&nbsp;\u03bcm long.<ref name=p199/> The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the edge of the gill) are typically 30 to 42 (though sometimes as much as 50)&nbsp;\u03bcm long by {{convert|6|-|10.5|\u03bcm}} wide. They are shaped like a [[hip-flask|flask]] or [[wine-skin]]. The top of the cell suddenly widens, and the cell as a whole is thin-[[cell wall|walled]], hyaline and yellowish, and sometimes appears to contain small grains.<ref name=p199/> The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) can be found in tufts at the top of the stem, and measure from {{convert|24|-|60|\u03bcm}} by {{convert|3|-|9|\u03bcm}}. They are cylindrical, or narrowly flask-shaped, sometimes with a long neck. They are, again, yellow and hyaline.<ref name=p200>Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos ''et al''. 2009, p. 200.</ref>\n\nThe yellowish [[hyphae]] are between 15 and 13.5&nbsp;\u03bcm wide with a wall of variable thickness. There are [[clamp connections]] at the [[septum|septa]] (the walls dividing individual hypha cells). The flesh in the cap is radial, and is made up of yellowish hyphae of between 2.4 and 20&nbsp;\u03bcm wide. The [[pileipellis]], the outermost layer of hyphae, forms a [[Trichoderm#Cutis|cutis]], and on older specimens (and on the small scales) forms a [[Trichoderm#Trichoderm|trichoderm]].<ref name=p200/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Gymnopilus junonius-02.jpg|thumb|right|alt= A side view of a thick, sturdy-looking brown mushroom with a prominent ring on the stem.|Although closely related, ''G.&nbsp;junonius'' ''(pictured)'' is different from ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' in a number of ways, including the presence of a well-developed ring.]]\nThere are five species similar in appearance to ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'': ''[[Gymnopilus arenophilus|G.&nbsp;arenophilus]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus decipiens|G.&nbsp;decipiens]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus flavus|G.&nbsp;flavus]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus fulgens|G.&nbsp;fulgens]]'' and ''[[Gymnopilus pseudofulgens|G.&nbsp;pseudofulgens]]''. ''G.&nbsp;arenophilus'' and particularly ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' are the most similar.<ref name=p202>Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos ''et al''. 2009, p. 202.</ref><ref name=p12/> Though ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' and ''G.&nbsp;arenophilus'' show similarities in their [[biogeography]] and [[ecology]], the typically slightly smaller ''G.&nbsp;arenophilus'' differs from ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]]. While ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' has a cap covered in fibrils with small scales, ''G.&nbsp;arenophilus'' can sometimes be completely smooth, and spore ornamentation differs, with ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' typically displaying larger warts.<ref name=p202/> Like ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'', ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' has been recorded growing on sand-dune [[heathland]]; further, the spores are similar in appearance to those of ''G.&nbsp;maritimus''. However, ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' requires soil rich in [[peat]] and must grow among moss. Moreover, there are a number of morphological differences; ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' mushrooms are larger and thicker, there are never remains of the partial veil on ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' stems, the shape of the top of the spores differs between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on ''G.&nbsp;maritimus''. ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' [[variety (botany)|var.]] ''luteicystis'' is even more distinct from ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' than the nominate variety.<ref>Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos ''et al.'' 2009, pp. 202\u20133.</ref> Despite the similarities between the three species, the three have been shown to be in different [[cladistics|clades]] within ''Gymnopilus'', suggesting ecological [[convergent evolution|convergence]] between ''G.&nbsp;arenophilus'' and ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'', and morphological convergence between ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' and ''G.&nbsp;maritimus''.<ref name=p203/>\n\n''Gymnopilus flavus'', despite also appearing on land near the [[Mediterranean]], can be differentiated from ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' as it lives among grass, especially ''[[Dactylis glomerata]]'', and it has distinctly smaller spores, typically measuring 5 to 6 by 3.5 to 4.2&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=p203>Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos ''et al''. 2009, p. 203.</ref> ''G.&nbsp;pseudofulgens'', also collected in Italy, shows two major morphological differences: it produces smaller mushrooms, and spores that are of a different shape with smaller warts. ''G.&nbsp;decipiens'', another species that grows on sandy soil, again has spores that are markedly different.<ref name=p203/> The American species ''[[Gymnopilus arenicola|G. arenicola]]'' also favours sandy soil, but has significantly smaller spores than ''G.&nbsp;maritimus''. Two other species of ''Gymnopilus'' found around the Mediterranean are ''[[Gymnopilus corsicus|G.&nbsp;corsicus]]'' and ''[[Gymnopilus spadiceus|G.&nbsp;spadiceus]]''. ''G.&nbsp;corsicus'' has no veil remnants on the stem, and spores that do not turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine, and so can easily be differentiated from ''G.&nbsp;maritimus''. ''G.&nbsp;spadiceus'' shows several similarities to ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'', but grows only on pine wood and has rectangular spores.<ref name=p203/>\n\n''Gymnopils maritimus'' is clearly a different species from other members of its clade, despite their close relation. All other species in the clade grow upon dead wood and have well-developed rings on their stems. The spores also differ; in the case of ''G.&nbsp;junonius'' and ''G.&nbsp;spectabilis'' (often considered synonymous), as well as ''G.&nbsp;pampeanus'', they are narrower, and in the case of ''G.&nbsp;imperialis'', they are wider. Of the other members of the clade, only ''G.&nbsp;junonius'' and ''G.&nbsp;spectabilis'' also grow in Europe.<ref name=p203/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Gymnopilus maritimus'' is known only from a single site in [[Pittulongu]], an area of [[Olbia]], in [[Sardinia]], Italy, which is the [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]]. There, mushrooms were found growing in close groups and tufts on coastal [[sand dunes]] around {{convert|10|m|ft}} from the [[high tide]] line.<ref name=p200/> They were observed at the base of live ''[[Juncus maritimus]]'' (sea rush) plants, growing on sandy soil or decaying plants,<ref name=p200/> where they were feeding as [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophs]]. As such, it is possible that the species would be able to grow on other [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]].<ref name=\"p202\"/> They were observed growing from autumn to winter,<ref name=p12>Contu and Vizzini 2009, p. 12. <!-- gregario, a volte anche cespitoso, in terreno sabbioso costiero alla base di arbusti viventi di Juncus maritimus, vicino al mare.

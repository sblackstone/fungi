Found in [[Western Australia]], it gets its [[common name]] from the propensity of the [[basidiocarp|fruiting bodies]] to spring out of decomposing animal remains. Its [[edible mushroom|edibility]] is unknown.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe ghoul fungus was first [[species description|described]] by mycologists R.N. Hilton and [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.]] in 1987.<ref name=\"Miller 1986\"/> The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''Hebe'', \"youth\", and  -''loma'', a fringe (pertaining to the fungal [[Veil (botany)|veil]]), referring to how the fungal veil is only seen in immature specimens.<ref>[http://www.britmycolsoc.org.uk/files/HFSG_News_Autumn2006.pdf Herefordshire Fungus Survey Group, News Sheet No 12: Autumn 2006]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It gets its common name of ghoul fungus from its habit of growing around animal carcasses.<ref name=\"Bougher98\">{{cite book |title=Fungi of Southern Australia|author=Bougher NL, Syme K. |year=1998|pages=274\u201375|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] Press |location=Nedlands, WA |isbn=978-1-875560-80-6}}</ref> The [[type (biology)|holotype]] collection consisted of about 100 specimens that were fruiting around the bones of a decomposing [[kangaroo]] carcass that had been dumped some months before.<ref name=\"Miller 1986\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe dull pinkish brown or cream [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|3|\u2013|11|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, convex initially before flattening out with age. There is a slight [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], and the cap margin is inrolled when young. A thin white veil rapidly disappears in young mushrooms. The cap surface is sticky initially. The adnate (or sometimes adnexed) gills are pale pink to pinkish brown and up to 1&nbsp;cm deep. With age, they can be encrusted with clumps of spores. The cylindrical [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|6.5|\u2013|9|cm|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|1|\u2013|1.2|cm|abbr=on|1}} in diameter and has a thickened base and lacks a ring. The thick [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is cream or pale yellow, with a bitter taste and a stale smell. The [[spore print]] is pinkish brown, and the oval spores measure 8.5 by 4.9&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. The [[mycelium]] is white.<ref name=\"Bougher98\"/>\n\nSimilar species include the introduced poisonpie (''[[Hebeloma crustuliniforme]]''), which has been recorded in pine plantations, the native western Australian poisonpie (''[[Hebeloma westraliense|H. westraliense]]''), which does not grow near carcasses, and the Australian white webcap (''[[Cortinarius austroalbidus]]''), which is paler and smells of [[curry]].<ref name =\"fungimap\">{{cite book |title=Fungi Down Under:the Fungimap Guide to Australian Fungi|author=Grey P.|year=2005|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens |location=Melbourne |isbn=978-0-646-44674-5|page=38}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nAn uncommon fungus, ''Hebeloma aminophilum'' is found in southern Western Australia, southeastern South Australia and Victoria.<ref name =\"fungimap\"/> Fruiting bodies arise in [[eucalyptus]] woodland in the vicinity of sheep, reptile and bird carcasses.<ref name =\"fungimap\"/> The habit of growing from flesh gives it the term sarcophilous.<ref name=\"Bougher98\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Hebeloma species|List of ''Hebeloma'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Miller 1986\">{{cite journal |author=Miller OK, Hilton RN. |title=New and interesting agarics from Western Australia |journal=Sydowia |year=1986 |volume=39 |pages=126\u201335 |url=http://www.landesmuseum.at/pdf_frei_remote/Sydowia_39_0126-0137.pdf}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5695538}}\n\n[[Category:Ammonia fungi]]\n[[Category:Hebeloma|aminophilum]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1987]]\n[[Category:Fungi native to Australia]]"}]}}}}

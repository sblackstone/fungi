It is bright blood-red, inedible, and grows in association with [[coniferous]] trees. It was previously widely known as ''Russula sanguinea''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Blut-T\u00e4ubling Russula sanguinaria.JPG|thumb|left| ''Russula sanguinaria'' in Germany, Schelklingen, Hausen]]\nThe bloody brittlegill was first described as ''Agaricus sanguinarius'' by [[Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher]] in 1803, and redescribed under its current binomial name by mycologist Stephan Rauschert in 1989. ''Agaricus sanguinea'' was described by [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Bulliard]] and renamed ''Russula sanguinea'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]].\n\nBoth the [[Species|specific epithets]] ''sanguinaria'' and ''sanguinea'' are derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sanguis'' \"blood\", a reference to this mushroom\u2019s colour.<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page= 118}}</ref> It is unclear whether this European species is the same as the American species ''Russula rosacea''.<ref name=arora86>{{cite book |last=[[David Arora|Arora]] |first=David |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms demystified: a comprehensive guide to the fleshy fungi |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |page=653 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe robust [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] grows up to {{convert|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter. At first it is convex, but later flattens, and sometimes becomes saucer-shaped when mature. It is bright blood-red, or rose coloured at first, fading slightly with age, and often having paler areas. The cap skin peels at the margin only. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is firmly robust, occasionally white, but more commonly flushed with the cap colour. It is streaked vertically, and tends to turn greyish pink with age. The cream to pale ochre [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate to slightly decurrent, narrow and forking. The spore print is also cream to pale ochre. The flesh is white, somewhat hot and peppery, and sometimes bitter on the tongue,<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book| author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page=17}}</ref> with a faint fruity smell.<ref name=Nilper/>\n\n===Similar species===\n*''[[Russula helodes]]'' is macroscopically identical, but tends to favour [[sphagnum]] moss in [[coniferous forest]]s, and is much rarer.\n*''[[Russula emetica]]'' (Schaeff.) Pers. grows in the same habitat, and has a bright red cap. However, it almost never has a coloured stipe, and is very crumbly and fragile.\nMost of the other common bright red ''Russula'' species grow with [[deciduous]] trees.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n'''''Russula sanguinaria''''' appears in summer and autumn. It is widespread in the northern [[temperate]] zones, and is [[mycorrhizal]] with softwood trees, often ''[[Pinus]]'' (pine) in [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous woodland]], on sandy soils.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Thomas Laessoe | year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref>\n\n==Edibility==\nThis mushroom is inedible; has a 'peppery' taste, and is sometimes quite bitter. Many similar-tasting Russulas are poisonous when eaten raw. The symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature: [[diarrhoea]], vomiting and [[colic]]ky abdominal cramps. The active agent has not been identified but is thought to consist of [[sesquiterpene]]s, which have been isolated from ''[[Russula sardonia]]'',<ref>Andina D. ''et al.'' (1980). \"Sesquiterpenes from ''Russula sardonia''.\" ''Phytochemistry'' '''19''': 93\u201397</ref> and the related genus ''[[Lactarius]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Benjamin| first= Denis R. |title=Mushrooms: Poisons and Panaceas \u2014 a Handbook for Naturalists, Mycologists and Physicians|page=369|publisher=WH Freeman and Company| location=New York |year=1995| isbn=0-7167-2600-9}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Russula species|List of ''Russula'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q886424}}\n\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1803]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Russula|sanguinaria]]\n[[Category:Inedible fungi]]"}]}}}}

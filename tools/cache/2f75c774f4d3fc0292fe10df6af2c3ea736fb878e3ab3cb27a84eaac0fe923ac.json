In addition, the surface of the cap is dry and covered with brownish [[fiber]]s and [[Scale (zoology)|scales]], especially over the center. Underneath, the cap can be whitish under normal [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]s, or pinkish in wet weather. Covered with fine, appressed greyish-brown scales and concentrated at the disc, the cap is thick, slowly becoming [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] when injured; the odor strongly smells [[phenol]]. It yellows in [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] of this mushroom are free from the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], crowded, and pale grayish-pink, turning brown in age. In addition, the stem is 6\u201315&nbsp;cm long, 1\u20131.5&nbsp;cm. thick and more or less equal, with an enlarged base (unlike typically ending in a small bulb like ''[[Agaricus pocillator]]''). Also, it is fairly smooth, white and bruising yellow, especially at the base, with a persistent [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], and the [[partial veil]] when still covering the gills developing brownish to yellowish droplets.<ref>[http://www.deq.state.mi.us/documents/deq-ogs-gimdl-PU26A.PDF Breitenbach & Kr\u00e4nzlin (vol. 4): sp. 188] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424073940/http://www.deq.state.mi.us/documents/deq-ogs-gimdl-PU26A.PDF |date=April 24, 2009 }}</ref><ref>Freeman, A.E.H.

The veil of the stipe is [[Biological membrane|membranous]], thick, white, and forms a persistent ring with a smooth upper and lower surface. The base of the stipe is typically yellow when bruised and smells of phenol.<ref>Kerrigan, Richard W. (1986). The Agaricales (Gilled Fungi) of California. 6. Agaricaceae.

Like other phenolic-odored ''Agaricus'' species, it can cause gastrointestinal upsets. Other people, who are not affected by the toxicity, may find it edible. The mushroom's taste is not distinctive and somewhat unpleasant; the odor is usually unpleasant, but not necessarily distinctive. The flesh is white, and the base becomes yellow when bruised.\n\n==Habitat==\n''Agaricus placomyces'' is [[saprobic]]. In addition, it grows in groups under hardwoods and in mixed woods during summer and fall. It is generally found east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and northern in distribution. Generally, it is solitary, living in either small groups, or clusters on disturbed ground under [[conifer]]s. Unlike many other ''Agaricus'' species, it fruits from mid to late winter rather than during the late spring, summer and early fall.<ref>Kerrigan, R.W., Callac, P., Guinberteau, J., Challen, M.P. & Parra, L.

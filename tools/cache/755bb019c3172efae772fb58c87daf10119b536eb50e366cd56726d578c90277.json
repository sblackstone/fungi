It has a widespread distribution, and has been found in Africa, Australasia, and the Americas. It may have been [[introduced species|introduced]] to North America with exotic plants. Similar to other stinkhorn fungi, the [[fruiting body]], known as the ''receptaculum'', starts out as a subterranean \"egg\" form. As the fungus develops, the receptaculum expands and erupts out of the protective [[volva (mycology)|volva]], ultimately developing into mature structures characterized by two to five long vertical orange or red spongy columns, joined together at the apex. The fully grown receptaculum reaches heights of {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall. The inside surfaces of the columns are covered with a [[wikt:fetid|fetid]] olive-brown [[spore]]-containing slime, which attracts flies and other insects that help disseminate the spores. Although once considered undesirable, the fungus is listed as [[edible mushroom|edible]]. It is found commonly in [[mulch]].\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe species was first named by the French botanist [[Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc]] in 1811.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Clathrus columnatus\"/> [[Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck]] transferred it into ''[[Laternea]]'' in 1858, a genus intended to accommodate those ''Clathrus''-like species with arms arranged in columns rather than a network;<ref name=Nees1858/> in its current meaning, ''Laternea'' includes species that have gleba suspended below the arch of the receptaculum by trabeculae (columns that extend from the [[peridium]] to the central core of the receptaculum).<ref name=Miller1988/> Other genera to which the species has been transferred include ''Linderia'' by [[Gordon Herriot Cunningham]] in 1932,<ref name=Cunningham1931/> ''Colonnaria'' by [[Eduard Fischer (mycologist)|Eduard Fischer]] in 1933, and ''Linderiella'' by Cunningham in 1942. ''Colonnaria'', ''Linderia'' and ''Linderiella'' are now considered obsolete genera, as they have been [[wikt:subsume|subsumed]] into ''[[Clathrus]]''.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Colonnaria\"/><ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Linderia\"/><ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Linderiella\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''columnatus'' is [[Latin]], meaning \"supported by pillars\".<ref name=Langenscheidt1955/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"column stinkhorn\".<ref name=McKnight1987/> [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] wrote in 1906 \"in Florida, it is known to the natives as \"Dead Men's Fingers.\"<ref name=Lloyd1906/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Clathrus columnatus two close.jpeg|thumb|left|Mature specimens showing the dark-colored gleba]]\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit body]], or receptaculum, of ''Clathrus columnatus'' consists of two to five (usually four) spongy vertical columns, which are separate where they arise from the [[volva (mycology)|volva]], but joined together at the top in an arch. The columns are joined together in pairs; the opposite pairs are joined by a short and broad arch similar in structure to the columns. The columns, which are narrower at the base than above, are reddish-orange above and yellowish-pink below. Young specimens have the fruit body compressed into the small interior space of an \"egg\",<ref name=\"urlwww.mushroomexpert.com\"/> which consists of a [[peridium]] that is surrounded by a gelatinous layer that encloses the compressed fruiting body. The egg, usually gray or grayish-brown,<ref name=\"urlwww.mushroomexpert.com\"/> typically reaches diameters of {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} before the columns grow. The [[volva (mycology)|volva]] remains at the base of the fruit body as a thick, loose, whitish sack. The mycelial cords found at the base of the volva are made of two types of tissues: a central bundle of fine [[hypha]]e that extend in a longitudinal direction, and an outer [[cortex (botany)|cortical]] layer of coarser hyphae that form a loose but highly interwoven structure. Full-grown columns can extend to {{convert|5|to|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} above the ground, a location that optimizes spore dispersal. The fetid-smelling [[gleba]], the spore-bearing mass, is smeared on the upper inner surface of the columns.<ref name=Burt1896/>\n\nThe [[spores]] are elliptical, smooth, and have dimensions of 3.5\u20135 by 2\u20132.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]].<ref name=\"urlwww.mushroomexpert.com\"/> They have thin walls, and are covered by a transparent envelope.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n===Edibility===\nThe words of [[William Gilson Farlow]], published in 1890, serve as a warning to those who might be inclined to consume ''Clathrus columnatus'': \"The odor of fully grown specimens of the order Phalloidea is so repulsive that the question as to their poisonous character when eaten by men has not often been the subject of experiment.\" Farlow described two cases of poisoning, one involving a young girl \"who ate a small piece of the fungus, and was seized with violent convulsions followed by loss of speech and a deep sleep lasting 52 hours\"; the other case involved [[Domestic pig|hog]]s that ate the fungus found in patches in oak woods, and died 12\u201315 hours later.<ref name=Farlow1890/> Despite this early report of poisoning, [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.]] notes that the taste of the egg is mild, and lists the species as [[edible mushroom|edible]].<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Clathrus ruber.jpg\n| caption1 = ''Clathrus ruber''\n| image2 = Pseudocolus fusiformis 423862.jpg\n| caption2 = ''Pseudocolus fusiformis''}}\n''[[Pseudocolus fusiformis]]'', ''[[Clathrus bicolumnatus]]'', and ''[[Clathrus ruber|C.&nbsp;ruber]]'' have similarities to ''Clathrus columnatus''. The lattice stinkhorn, ''C.&nbsp;ruber'', has a larger, more globular, lattice-like receptacle. The \"stinky squid\", ''P.&nbsp;fusiformis'', has arms that are attached at the bases, and free at the top. It grows on rotting logs and chip-mulched soil, in contrast to ''C.&nbsp;columnatus'', which grows on sandy soil.<ref name=McKnight1987/> ''C.&nbsp;bicolumnatus'' has a smaller stature (up to 9&nbsp;cm tall), and only has two columns.<ref name=\"urlwww.mushroomexpert.com\"/>\n\n==Development==\nThe American botanist [[Edward Angus Burt]] published a detailed description of the development of ''C.&nbsp;columnatus'' in 1896. He found that the egg consists of cortical and [[wikt:medullary|medullary]] systems continued upward from the mycelial strand in the earliest stage. The cortical layer gives rise to the outer layer of the volva, the cortical plates and the pseudoparenchyma (thin-walled, usually angular, randomly arranged cells that are tightly packed) of the receptaculum. The medullary portion gives rise to the gelatinous masses of the gelatinous layer of the volva, to the gleba, and to the gelatinous tissue of the chambers of the receptaculum. The elongation of the receptacle begins at the base and after its elongation, the gleba hangs suspended from the arch of the receptaculum by medullary tissue constituting the chamber masses of the receptacle.<ref name=Burt1896/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat and distribution==\n\nLike all ''Phallaceae'' species, ''C.&nbsp;columnatus'' is [[saprobic]], and uses extracellular digestion to acquire nutrients from dead and decaying [[organic matter]], like wood. As a consequence of its predilection for dead wood, the fungus is often associated with disturbed habitats. It can often be found growing in and around gardens and residences where areas of cultivation or landscaping have resulted in accumulations of [[mulch]], wood chips or other [[cellulose]]-rich materials. The mycelial cords can be traced to buried roots, stumps, and other woody material.<ref name=Miller1988/> The species grows in sandy soil,<ref name=Burt1896/> near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil.<ref name=\"urlwww.mushroomexpert.com\"/> Fruit bodies appear singly, or scattered, and can arise in the summer, autumn, and early winter, especially after wet weather.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\nLike other member of the [[Phallaceae]] family, the mature fungus attracts insects with its smell to help disperse its spores. ''[[Psilopyga fasciata]]'', a stinkhorn beetle of the [[sap beetle]] family, has been recorded feeding on the gleba of Mexican specimens.<ref name=Navarree2003/>\n\nIn 1980 [[Donald Malcolm Dring]] summarized the known geographical distribution of ''C.&nbsp;columnatus''; the fungus has been collected in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Oceania]], [[New Guinea]], [[Africa]], and [[North America|North]] and [[South America]];<ref name=Dring1980/> According to Australian mycologist [[Tom May (mycologist)|Tom May]], the Australian distribution is \"presumably erroneous\", as it is based on only a single collection in 1948.<ref name=May2003/> In Central America, it has been collected from Costa Rica.<ref name=Saenz1982/> It is also found in China, in [[Jiangsu]], [[Fujian]], and [[Guangdong]].<ref name=Zhishu1993/> The North American distribution extends south to Mexico, and north to [[New York (state)|New York]];<ref name=\"urlwww.mushroomexpert.com\"/> it is also in [[Hawaii]].<ref name=McKnight1987/> The fungus is less common in the southeastern and southern United States.<ref name=Miller2006/> It is thought to have been [[introduced species|introduced]] to North America, as it typically appear in landscaped areas or other locations where exotic plants have been established.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |pages=773\u201374 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-RmabYsjI4C&lpg=PA773&dq=clathrus%20columnatus&pg=PA773#v=onepage&q=clathrus%20columnatus&f=false |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Burt1896>{{cite journal |author=Burt EA |year=1896 |title=The Phalloideae of the United States.

It is found in the northeastern, southeastern, and southern United States as well as southern Canada, where it grows solitarily or in small groups on the ground in [[mixed forest|mixed woods]]. The [[Basidiocarp|fruit body]] is white to brownish, with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that measure up to {{convert|12.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, and [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|20|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. The surface of the cap is covered with reddish-brown to grayish-brown conical warts. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] has a bulbous base covered with grayish-brown scales.  The fruit bodies smell faintly like [[bleaching powder]]. Although not known to be [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], the mushroom is not recommended for consumption.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first described by American botanist [[William Chambers Coker]] in 1917, in his [[monograph]] of Amanitas of the eastern United States. Coker's description was based on several specimens he had collected from various locations in [[North Carolina]] in September and October 1914. The [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] honors George Atkinson, a [[Cornell University]] mycologist who collected and described mushrooms in the southern and eastern United States in the late 19th century.<ref name=Metzler1992/> In 1952, [[Marcel Locquin]] chose to place it in the genus ''[[Armillaria]]'' as ''Armillaria atkinsoniana'', but this change was not adopted by later authors.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Armillaria atkinsoniana\"/><ref name=Loquin1952/>{{#tag:ref|[[Rolf Singer]] wrote in 1955: \"Locquin is quite isolated among mycologists who believe that the structural differences between ''Armillaria luteovirens'' and the Amanitas are too large and significant to combine any ''Armillaria'' with any ''Amanita''\".<ref name=Singer1955/>|group=nb}}\n\n''Amanita atkinsoniana'' is [[biological classification|classified]] in the [[wikt:stirp|stirps]] ''Microlepsis'' of subsection ''Solitariae'', in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Lepidella'' of the genus ''[[Amanita]]''.<ref name=Bhatt2004/> Species in the subsection ''Solitariae'' are distinguished by several characteristics: a [[volva (mycology)|volva]] composed of cellular structures of varying shape; rows of large cylindrical to slender club-shaped cells that are never dominant; a stem that typically has a bulbous base and remnants of the [[volva (mycology)|volva]] on the surface that are concentrated towards the base; the volva is not membranous nor nearly membranous, never forming a limb at the base of the stem, and never forming patches on the surface of the cap, where the outer layer consists of [[hypha]]e pressed against the surface.<ref name=Singer1986/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Amanita atkinsoniana 72050 crop.jpg|thumb|left|This mature fruit body has a plano-convex cap; the margin bears floccose patches, remnants of the partial veil.]]\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''A.&nbsp;atkinsoniana'' is {{convert|6|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, and depending on its age, ranges in shape from convex to flattened, sometimes with a shallow central depression. Its color can vary from whitish to yellowish-white, brownish-gray, brownish-orange to grayish-brown, and is lighter on the margin. The cap surface is covered with the remnants of the [[universal veil]] as small reddish-brown to grayish-brown, easily removable, conical warts. Approaching the edge of the cap, the warts gradually become small, woolly patches. The cap margin is smooth or has faint grooves mirroring the underlying gills, and has [[partial veil]] remnants hanging along the edge. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free from attachment to the stem, close to crowded together, moderately broad, yellowish-white, and occasionally have a slight reddish stain. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stem) are truncate (cut off sharply) to attenuate. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|8|\u2013|20|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, equal or tapering slightly toward apex, whitish, and [[wikt:floccose|floccose]] to smooth. The basal bulb is club-shaped, [[wikt:ventricose|ventricose]]-[[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] or turnip-shaped, rounded or pointed, usually covered with rings of reddish-brown scales or warts of universal veil remains, often extending up the stem for a short distance.<ref name=Bhatt2004/> The universal veil on the stem base is quite unusual in ''Amanita'', because it forms warts that extend nearly to the very bottom of the bulb.<ref name=\"urlAmanita atkinsoniana Coker\"/> The stem often roots into the soil beneath the bulb with an elongated cord of [[mycelium]] known as a ''pseudorhiza''.<ref name=Smith1980/> The partial veil forms a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] that is somewhat membranous, fragile to moderately persistent, and yellowish-white to pale yellow. Eventually, as the mushroom matures, it collapses on the stem as a thin membrane. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, with a weak odor of [[bleaching powder]].<ref name=Bhatt2004/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n[[File:Amanita atkinsoniana 100686.jpg|thumb|right|A partial veil covers the developing gills of young fruit bodies.]]\nThe [[spore print]] is white. The [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to elongated, [[hyaline]] (translucent), thin-walled, and have dimensions of 9\u201312.5 by 5.5\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are [[amyloid]], meaning they will absorb [[iodine]] when stained with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are 35\u201360 by 7\u201313.5&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, four-spored, with clamps at their bases. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] found on the edge of the gill) are 15\u201345 by 10\u201330&nbsp;\u00b5m, ellipsoid to club-shaped, and abundant. The [[Pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is up to 165&nbsp;\u00b5m thick, and is made of interwoven to radial [[hypha]]e, 2.5\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m diameter, which is slightly to strongly gelatinized. The universal veil on the cap consists of mainly roughly spherical to ellipsoid but also club-shaped and elongated cells, up to 75 by 40&nbsp;\u00b5m, arranged in short, terminal chains and relatively sparse hyphae, measuring 3\u20137.5&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter. At the base of the stem the universal veil tissue is very similar to that on the cap. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae.<ref name=Bhatt2004/>\n\n===Edibility===\nPomerleau (1980) considers the mushroom as \"doubtfully edible\",<ref name=Pomerleau1980/> while [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.|Orson]] and Hope Miller, in their [[field guide]] to North American mushrooms, list it as \"possibly poisonous\" (although they also indicate that no specific reports of toxins have been reported from the species), and recommend that in general, no species in ''Amanita'' subgenus ''Lepidella'' should be consumed.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Amanita onusta 47425.jpg|thumb|right|''Amanita onusta'' is a potential lookalike species.]]\nBecause of the colored volva, ''A.&nbsp;atkinsoniana'' resembles ''[[Amanita onusta|A.&nbsp;onusta]]'', which differs from ''A.&nbsp;atkinsoniana'' by the small to medium-sized fruit bodies with a grayish veil as dark gray to brownish gray warts and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting. Sometimes the fruit bodies of ''A.&nbsp;atkinsoniana'' are confused with ''[[Amanita microlepsis|A.&nbsp;microlepsis]]'' which can be distinguished by the presence of reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of ''A.&nbsp;atkinsoniana''.<ref name=Bhatt2004/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe fruit bodies of ''Amanita atkinsoniana'' grow on the ground in [[mixed forest|mixed coniferous and deciduous forests]]. They have been collected in [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]], [[Michigan]], [[North Carolina]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Vermont]], and [[West Virginia]].<ref name=Bhatt2004/><ref name=Lewis1981/> One [[field guide]] notes a preference for association with [[oak]] where there is ground cover of blueberry (''[[Vaccinium]]'') bushes.<ref name=Smith1980/> The mushroom has also been collected in [[Quebec, Canada]].<ref name=Pomerleau1980/><ref name=Pomerleau1964/> The southern extent of its range extends to the Mexican state of [[Michoac\u00e1n]].<ref name=\"urlAmanita atkinsoniana Coker\"/> The mushroom fruits most commonly during late summer and fall after heavy rains.<ref name=Smith1980/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"nb\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Bhatt2004>{{cite book |author=Bhatt RP, Miller OK Jr. |editor-last=Cripps CL |title=Fungi in Forest Ecosystems: Systematics, Diversity, and Ecology |publisher=New York Botanical Garden Press |location=New York, New York |year=2004 |pages=33\u201359 |chapter=''Amanita'' subgenus ''Lepidella'' and related taxa in the southeastern United States |isbn=978-0-89327-459-7}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Coker1917>{{cite journal |author=Coker WC. |year=1917 |title=The Amanitas of the eastern United States |journal=Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Scientific Society |volume=33 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=84\u20135}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Lewis1981>{{cite journal |author=Lewis DP, McGraw JL Jr. |year=1981 |title=Agaricales, family Amanitaceae, of the Big Thicket |journal=The Southwestern Naturalist |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20134 |jstor=3671322 |doi=10.2307/3671322}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Loquin1952>{{cite journal |author=Locquin M. |year=1952 |title=Sur la non-validit\u00e9 de quelques genres d\u2019Agaricales |journal=Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mycologique de France |trans-title=On the non-validity of some genera of Agaricales |volume=68 |pages=165\u20139 |language=French}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Metzler1992>{{cite book |author=Metzler V, Metzler S. |title=Texas Mushrooms: A Field Guide |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin, Texas |year=1992 |page=67 |isbn=0-292-75125-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HRtfvVigMmsC&pg=PA67}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Miller2006>{{cite book |author=Miller HR, Miller OK. |title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi |publisher=Falcon Guide |location=Guilford, Connecticut |year=2006 |page=44 |isbn=0-7627-3109-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjvXkLpqsEgC&pg=PA44}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Pomerleau1964>{{cite journal |author=Pomerleau R, Cooke WB. |year=1964 |title=IX International Botanical Congress: Field Trip No. 22: Quebec Fungi |journal=Mycologia |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=618\u201326 |jstor=3756366 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0056/004/0618.htm |access-date=2011-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923224819/http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0056/004/0618.htm |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Pomerleau1980>{{cite book |author=Pomerleau R. |year=1980 |title=Flore des Champignons au Qu\u00e9bec |publisher=Les Editions La Presse |trans-title=Mushroom flora of Quebec |location=Montreal, Canada |isbn=978-2-89043-022-8 |language=French}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Singer1955>{{cite journal |author=Singer R. |year=1955 |title=The nomenclature of ''Armillaria'', ''Hypholoma'', and ''Entoloma'' |journal=Mycologia |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=147\u20139 |jstor=3755765 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0047/001/0147.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Singer1986>{{cite book |author=Singer R. |title=The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy |edition=4th |publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books |location=K\u00f6nigstein im Taunus, Germany |year=1986 |page=452 |isbn=3-87429-254-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Smith1980>{{cite book |author=Smith AH, Weber NS. |title=The Mushroom Hunter's Field Guide |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |year=1980 |page=150 |isbn=0-472-85610-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYI4f6fqrfkC&pg=RA3-PA173}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlAmanita atkinsoniana Coker\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/amanita/species/atkinson.html |title=''Amanita atkinsoniana'' Coker |author=Tulloss RE |work=''Amanita'' studies |accessdate=2010-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716104321/http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/amanita/species/atkinson.html |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Armillaria atkinsoniana\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=292690 |title=''Armillaria atkinsoniana'' (Coker) Locq. 1952 |publisher=[[MycoBank]].

It is one of the most common species of ''Russula'' in [[Europe]].\n\nIt is an [[edible mushroom]]. It was designated \"Mushroom of the Year\" in 1997 by the [[German Association of Mycology]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe most salient characteristic is the weak gills, which feel greasy to the touch, are flexible and do not break. The cap is 4\u201315&nbsp;cm (1.5\u20136&nbsp;in) wide, convex at first and later flattened, and greenish to bright brown (they vary considerably in color). The stipe is pure white, slightly convex underneath, up to 10&nbsp;cm in height and 1.5\u20132.5&nbsp;cm (0.5\u20131&nbsp;in) in diameter. The spores are pure white. The stipe will give a green reaction when rubbed with iron salts (Ferrous Sulphate). Most other (but not all) russula species give a salmon reaction. Coupled with the gill flexibility this is a good diagnostic clue to species level.\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n''Russula cyanoxantha'' grows in slightly acidic, but nutrient-rich soil. Like all ''Russulas'', it is a  [[mycorrhizal fungus]]. It is found most commonly in [[beech]] forests, and often in deciduous or mixed forests, appearing from May to November, with the highest concentration in July to September.\n\n==Use==\nSuitable for many kinds of preparation; the flesh is not as hard as that of many other edible Russulas. It has a mild, nutty taste.\n\n==Similar species==\nThe cap of the grey-green Russula [[Russula grisea]] is more blue-grey but has violet or green hues with light cream gills. This fungus also grows in mixed forests, particularly under beech, and more rarely in coniferous forests.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Russula species|List of ''Russula'' species]]\n\n==References==\n*E.

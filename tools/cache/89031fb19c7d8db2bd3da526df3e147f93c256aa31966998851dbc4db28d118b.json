Described as new to science in 1853, the widely distributed species is known from Asia, Australia, North America, Central America, and South America. [[Mycorrhiza]]l with [[oak]], the fungus fruits on the ground singly, scattered, or in groups in woods. [[Basidiocarp|Fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) have convex to flat, yellowish to brownish-red [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter. On the cap underside, the pore surface is bright yellow before turning dingy yellow to grayish brown with age; it stains greenish blue then grayish brown after injury. A cottony and powdery [[partial veil]] remains as a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. The mushrooms are [[edible mushroom|edible]], and have been used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and for [[mushroom dye]]ing.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] as ''Boletus ravenelii'' by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] in 1853. Specimens were sent to them by American botanist [[Henry William Ravenel]], who collected them in [[South Carolina]]. They considered the bolete \"a most splendid species closely allied to ''[[Boletus hemichrysus|B.&nbsp;hemichrysus]]'', and, like that, remarkable for the pulverulent veil.\"<ref name=\"Berkeley 1853\"/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] honors Ravenel.<ref name=\"Bessette 2000\"/> [[William Alphonso Murrill]] transferred the fungus to the genus ''[[Pulveroboletus]]'' in 1909, giving it the name by which it is known today.<ref name=\"Murrill 1909\"/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as \"Ravenel's bolete\"<ref name=\"Roody 2003\"/> or the \"powdery sulfur bolete\".<ref name=\"Bessette 2000\"/>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Pulveroboletus ravenelii 56435.jpg|thumb|left|Young specimen with an intact partial veil]]\n\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is rounded to convex before flattening with age, and attains a diameter of {{convert|1|\u2013|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Its margin is curved inward when young, and usually has hanging remnants of the [[partial veil]]. The surface is dry and initially coated with fine particles, while later it develops fine hairs or small scales that are pressed down flat on the surface; in maturity the surface usually develops fine cracks or wrinkles. It is bright yellow, later turning to orange-red to brownish red. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white to pale yellow, and, when cut, will slowly stain pale blue, then dingy yellow to pale brown. Its flesh has been described variously as indistinct,<ref name=\"Bessette 2000\"/> or bitter tasting with an odor of [[hickory]] leaves.<ref name=\"Roody 2003\"/> The pore surface is bright yellow before turning dingy yellow to grayish brown with age. It stains greenish blue then grayish brown after being bruised or injured. The pores, which number about 1\u20133 per millimeter, are angular to almost circular. The tubes comprising the pore surface are {{convert|5|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep. The yellow [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures {{convert|4.5|\u2013|14.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.6|\u2013|1.6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and is roughly equal in width throughout or somewhat thicker near the base. It is solid (i.e., not hollow), and, above the level of the base, the surface is covered with minute hairs pressed flat against the surface. The [[partial veil]], also bright yellow, is cottony and powdery, and remains as a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the upper portion of the stem,<ref name=\"Bessette 2000\"/> although in some specimens it merges gradually with the stipe surface and becomes inconspicuous.<ref name=\"Roody 2003\"/> There is white [[mycelium]] at the stipe base.<ref name=\"Halling 2005\"/>\n\n''Pulveroboletus ravenelii'' produces an olive-grey to olive-brown [[spore print]]. [[Spore]]s are elliptical to oval, smooth, and measure 8\u201310 by 4\u20135&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].<ref name=\"Bessette 2000\"/> The [[hypha]]l tissue in the [[hymenophore]] is [[inamyloid]] and bilateral, meaning it diverges downward from the flesh toward the edge of the hymenophore, away from a central strand. The tubes have scattered [[cystidia]] on the walls (pleurocystidia) and abundant cystidia on the edges (cheilocystidia). The hyphae in the [[cap cuticle]] are arranged as an ixotrichodermium\u2013long and typically multi-celled, with erect hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent from the hyphae.<ref name=\"Halling 2005\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\nThe fruit bodies of ''Pulveroboletus ravenelii'' grow on the ground singly, scattered, or in groups in woods under conifers.<ref name=\"Bessette 2000\"/> Preferred [[mycorrhiza]]l plant hosts include [[pine]], [[tsuga|hemlock]], and [[rhododendron]].<ref name=\"Roody 2003\"/> Fruiting occurs from July to October. In North America, it is distributed from eastern Canada extending south to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and west to [[Texas]], [[Michigan]], and [[California]].<ref name=\"Bessette 2000\"/> The bolete was reported from a [[Mexican beech]] (''Fagus mexicana'') forest in [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], Mexico in 2010.<ref name=\"Rodr\u00edguez-Ram\u00edrez 2010\"/> It has also been recorded from Costa Rica<ref name=\"Halling 2008\"/> and Colombia. In Asia, it has been found in Indonesia<ref name=\"Halling 2005\"/> and China.<ref name=\"Bo 1980\"/> It has also been recorded from northeast Australia.<ref name=\"Halling 2005\"/>\n\n==Uses==\n''Pulveroboletus ravenelii'' mushrooms are [[edible mushroom|edible]].<ref name=\"Bessette 2000\"/> They have been used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] to treat [[lumbago]], numbed limbs, and as an [[antihemorrhagic]]. [[Bioactivity|Bioactive]] compounds that have been identified from the fruit bodies include pulveravin&nbsp;A, pulveravin&nbsp;B, [[vulpinic acid]],<ref name=\"Duncan 2003\"/> and pulverolide.<ref name=\"Yang 2010\"/> Mushrooms are also used in [[mushroom dye]]ing to produce the colors yellow, gold, greenish yellow, orange, or olive, depending on the [[mordant]] used.<ref name=\"Bessette 2001\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of North American boletes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bessette 2000\">{{cite book |title=North American Boletes |vauthors=Bessette AE, Roody WC, Bessette AR |year=2000 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |isbn=978-0-8156-0588-1 |pages=223\u20134}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bessette 2001\">{{cite book |vauthors=Bessette A, Bessette AR |title=The Rainbow Beneath my Feet: A Mushroom Dyer's Field Guide |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |year=2001 |page=49 |isbn=978-0-8156-0680-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WbvR2PwKcIC&pg=PA49}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bo 1980\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bo L, Bau YS |title=Fungi and mycological literature of the Szechwan Province in China |journal=Mycologia |year=1980 |volume=72 |issue=6 |pages=1117\u201326 |jstor=3759565 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0072/006/1117.htm |doi=10.2307/3759565}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Berkeley 1853\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Berkeley MJ, Curtis MA |title=Centuries of North American fungi |journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History |year=1853 |volume=12 |pages=417\u201335 (see p.&nbsp;429) |series=II |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/22191863}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Duncan 2003\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Duncan CJ, Cuendet M, Fronczek FR, Pezzuto JM, Mehta RG, Hamann MT, Ross SA |title=Chemical and biological investigation of the fungus ''Pulveroboletus ravenelii'' |journal=Journal of Natural Products |year=2003 |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=103\u20137 |pmid=12542354 |doi=10.1021/np0203990|pmc=4969011 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Halling 2005\">{{cite book |vauthors=Halling RE, Mueller GM |title=Common Mushrooms of the Talamanca Mountains, Costa Rica |year=2005 |publisher=New York Botanical Garden Press |location=New York, New York |page=69 |isbn=978-0-89327-460-3}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Halling 2008\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Halling RE, Osmundson TW, Neves MA |title=Pacific boletes: Implications for biogeographic relationships |journal=Mycological Research |year=2008 |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=437\u201347 |doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2007.11.021 |pmid=18316181}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Murrill 1909\">{{cite journal |author=Murrill WA. |title=The Boletaceae of North America \u2013 1 |journal=Mycologia |year=1909 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=4\u201318 |jstor= |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0001/001/0004.htm |doi=10.2307/3753167}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Rodr\u00edguez-Ram\u00edrez 2010\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodr\u00edguez-Ram\u00edrez EC, Moreno CE |title=Bolete diversity in two relict forests of the Mexican beech (''Fagus grandifolia'' var.

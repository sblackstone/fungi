First reported in Japan in 1989, it was not formally validated as a species until 2007, the delay related to a publication error. The receptacle, or [[basidiocarp|fruit body]], begins as a partially buried whitish egg-shaped structure, which bursts open as a hollow white [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]] with reddish arms, then erupts and grows to a height of up to {{convert|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. It matures into a star-shaped structure with seven to nine thin reddish tubular \"arms\" up to {{convert|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long radiating from the central area. The top of the receptacle is covered with dark olive-brown spore-slime, or [[gleba]]. ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'' can be distinguished from the more common species ''[[Aseroe rubra|A.&nbsp;rubra]]'' by differences in the color of the receptacle, and in the structure of the arms. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the fungus has not been reported.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe fungus was first described provisionally (denoted by ''[[ad interim]]'') as ''Aseroe coccinea'' by the Japanese mycologists Yoshimi and [[Tsuguo Hongo]] in a 1989 publication with a Japanese description, based on a specimen collected on September 29, 1985 in [[Utsunomiya]], [[Tochigi Prefecture]], Japan.<ref name=Yoshimi1989/> The name, however, was not published validly (''nomen invalidum''), according to Article 36.1 of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]], which requires that \"in order to be validly published, a name of a new taxon (algal and all fossil taxa excepted) must ... be accompanied by a Latin description or diagnosis or by a reference to a previously and effectively published Latin description or diagnosis\".<ref name=McNeill1986/> Taiga Kasuya reexamined the [[type specimen]] and validated the species in a 2007 ''[[Mycoscience]]'' publication. The [[holotype]] specimen is kept at the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Tokyo]].<ref name=Kasuya2007/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''coccinea'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''coccineus'', and means \"bright red\". The mushroom's Japanese name is ''Aka-hitode-take'' (\u30a2\u30ab\u30d2\u30c8\u30c7\u30bf\u30b1).<ref name=Kasuya2007/>\n\n==Description==\nLike all [[Phallaceae]] species, ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'' begins its development in the form of a roughly spherical whitish \"egg\" that is {{convert|10|\u2013|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, lying on or partially submerged in the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. On the base of the egg is a white strand of [[mycelium]]. The exo[[peridium]] (the outer tissue layer) is white to [[cream (color)|cream]]-colored with a fibrous surface. The inner layer is membranous, with a [[hyaline]] (translucent) endoperidium (inner tissue layer). The slimy spore-bearing mass, the [[gleba]], is olive-brown to greenish-black, with a slightly [[wikt:fetid|fetid]] odor. When the mushroom is mature, it covers the upper surface of a disc on the top of the receptacle. The receptacle has a cylindrical stipe, {{convert|10|\u2013|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|7|\u2013|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter at the top, somewhat [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] (tapered at both ends) or sometimes just tapered towards the base. The stipe is pale pink near the top, white to [[cream (color)|cream]] at the base, spongy in texture, and hollow. The top of the receptacle is flattened to form a disc that bears 7\u20139, narrow, tapering \"arms\". The arms consist of a single bright red tube-like chamber, that is {{convert|4|\u2013|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.7|\u2013|2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Kasuya2007/>\n[[image:Aseroe rubra Bomaderry email.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Aseroe rubra]]'' is somewhat similar in appearance, but clearly distinguished by its bifurcating (forked) arms.]]\nThe thick-walled [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to cylindrical, and measure 4\u20135 by 2\u20132.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]]. They are [[hyaline]] (translucent), have a smooth surface, and are sometimes truncated at the base. The peridium of the \"egg\" is divided into two distinct layers of tissue. The outer is up to 250\u2013400&nbsp;\u03bcm thick, and made of filamentous, interwoven [[hypha]]e measuring 2.5\u20135&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. These hyphae are thick-walled, [[septum|septate]], and hyaline. Also present in this outer layer are thick-walled pseudoparenchymatous cells (angular, randomly arranged, and tightly packed) that are 7\u201350&nbsp;\u03bcm thick, spherical or nearly so, and yellowish-brown to pale brown. The inner tissue layer of the peridium is 100\u2013250&nbsp;\u03bcm thick and made of elongated filamentous hyphae that are 2\u20135&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. These thick-walled hyphae are arranged in a roughly parallel fashion, septate, and hyaline. The receptacle consists of thick-walled, roughly spherical pseudoparenchymatous cells 5\u201315.5&nbsp;\u03bcm thick, that contain intracellular [[pigment]].<ref name=Kasuya2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''A.&nbsp;coccinea'' closely resembles ''[[Aseroe arachnoidea|A.&nbsp;arachnoidea]]'', but may be distinguished from the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4\u20135 by 2.5\u20133&nbsp;\u03bcm in ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'' compared with 2.5\u20133.5 by 1.5&nbsp;\u03bcm in ''A.&nbsp;arachnoidea''). ''A.&nbsp;arachnoidea'' is known from Asia and West Africa. ''[[Aseroe rubra|A.&nbsp;rubra]]'' is a relatively common [[pantropical]] species, and differs from ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'' in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'') and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.<ref name=Kasuya2007/><ref name=Dring1980/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nAlthough Kasuya did not explicitly define the mode of nutrition for ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'', most [[Phallaceae]] species are suspected to be [[saprobic]]\u2014decomposers of wood and plant [[organic matter]].<ref name=Miller1988/> The fruit bodies of ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'', known only from [[temperate]] regions of Japan ([[Tochigi Prefecture]]), grow solitarily or in groups on rice [[husk]]s, straw, or dung. They are found from summer to autumn.<ref name=Kasuya2007/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Dring1980>{{cite journal |author=Dring DM. |year=1980 |title=Contributions towards a rational arrangement of the Clathraceae |journal=Kew Bulletin |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201396 |jstor=4117008 |doi=10.2307/4117008}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kasuya2007>{{cite journal |title=Validation of ''Asero\u00eb coccinea'' (Phallales, Phallaceae) |author=Kasuya T. |journal=Mycoscience |year=2007 |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=309\u201311 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q3900922143l3u58/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s10267-007-0370-8}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=McNeill1986>{{cite web |url=http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/frameset/0040Ch4Sec2a036.htm |title=Division Ii.

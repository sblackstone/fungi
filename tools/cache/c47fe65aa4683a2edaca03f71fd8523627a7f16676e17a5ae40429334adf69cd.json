It has been inadvertently [[introduced species|introduced]] to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and South America, probably transported in soil with European trees. Various shades of brown in colour, the [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] grows up to 6&nbsp;cm (2.4&nbsp;in) high and has a funnel-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to 12&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;in) wide with a distinctive inrolled rim and [[decurrent]] gills that may be pore-like close to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. Although it has [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], it is more closely related to the pored [[bolete]]s than to typical gilled [[mushrooms]]. It was first described by [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] in 1785, and was given its current [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838. Genetic testing suggests that ''Paxillus involutus'' may be a [[species complex]] rather than a single species.\n\nA common mushroom of [[temperate deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]] woods and grassy areas in late summer and autumn, ''Paxillus involutus'' forms [[ectomycorrhiza]]l relationships with a broad range of tree species. These benefit from the [[symbiosis]] as the fungus reduces their intake of [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] and increases resistance to pathogens such as ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]''. Previously considered [[edible mushroom|edible]] and eaten widely in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]], it has since been found to be dangerously [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], after being responsible for the death of German mycologist [[Julius Sch\u00e4ffer]] in 1944. It had been recognized as causing gastric upsets when eaten raw, but was more recently found to cause potentially fatal [[autoimmune]] [[hemolysis]], even in those who had consumed the mushroom for years without any other ill effects. An [[antigen]] in the mushroom triggers the [[immune system]] to attack red blood cells. Serious and commonly fatal [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] include [[Renal failure#Acute renal failure|acute renal failure]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], acute [[respiratory failure]], and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\n[[File:L'agaric contigu (Paxillus involutus).jpg|thumb|left|Bulliard's 1785 drawing of \"L'Agaric contigu\" (''Agaricus contiguus'')]]\nThe brown roll-rim was described by French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] in 1785 as ''Agaricus contiguus'',<ref name=Bulliard1785/> although the 1786 combination ''Agaricus involutus'' of [[August Batsch]]<ref name=Batsch1786/> is taken as the first [[valid name (botany)|valid description]].<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Paxillus involutus\"/> [[James Bolton]] published a description of what he called ''Agaricus adscendibus'' in 1788;<ref name=Bolton1788/> the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] authority [[Index Fungorum]] considers this to be [[synonym (biology)|synonymous]] with ''P.&nbsp;involutus''.<ref name=\"urlFungorum: Agaricus adscendibus\"/> Additional synonyms include ''Omphalia involuta'' described by [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] in 1821,<ref name=Gray1821/> and ''Rhymovis involuta'', published by [[Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst]] in 1844.<ref name=Rabenhorst1844/> The species gained its current [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] in 1838 when the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] erected the genus ''[[Paxillus]]'', and set it as the [[type species]].<ref name=Fries1838/> The starting date of fungal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] had been set as January&nbsp;1, 1821, to coincide with the date of Fries' works, which meant that names coined earlier than this date required [[sanctioned name|sanction]] by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered [[correct name (botany)|valid]]. It was thus written ''Paxillus involutus'' (Batsch:Fr.) Fr. A 1987 revision of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] set the starting date at May&nbsp;1, 1753, the date of publication of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' seminal work, the ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Esser, K. |author2=Lemke, P.A. |title= The Mycota: A Comprehensive Treatise on Fungi as Experimental Systems for Basic and Applied Research |publisher = Springer|location=Heidelberg, Germany |year=1994|page=81|isbn = 3-540-66493-9}}</ref> Hence the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority.\n\nThe genus was later placed in a new family, [[Paxillaceae]], by French mycologist [[Ren\u00e9 Maire]] who held it to be related to both [[agaric]]s and boletes.<ref name=Maire1902/> Although it has gills rather than pores, it has long been recognised as belonging to the pored mushrooms of the order [[Boletales]] rather than the traditional agarics.<ref name=Nilson1977/> The generic name is derived from the [[Latin]] for 'peg' or 'plug', and the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''involutus'', 'inrolled', refers to the cap margin.<ref name=Nilson1977/> [[Common name]]s include the naked brimcap,<ref name=\"usfda\"/> poison paxillus,<ref name=Lincoff2008/> inrolled pax,<ref name=Arora1986/> poison pax, common roll-rim, brown roll-rim,<ref name=Benjamin1995/> and brown chanterelle.<ref name=Barceloux2008/> Gray called it the \"involved navel-stool\" in his 1821 compendium of British flora.<ref name=Gray1821/>\n\nStudies of the ecology and genetics of ''Paxillus involutus'' indicate that it may form a [[species complex|complex]] of multiple similar-looking species.<ref name=Hahn1999/><ref name=Hedh2008/> In a field study near [[Uppsala]], Sweden, conducted from 1981 to 1983, mycologist Nils Fries found that there were three populations of ''P.&nbsp;involutus'' unable to breed with each other. One was found under conifers and mixed woodlands, while the other two were found in parklands, associated with nearby birch trees. He found that the first group tended to produce single isolated fruit bodies which had a thinner stipe and cap which was less inrolled at the margins, while the fruit bodies of the other two populations tended to appear in groups, and have thicker stipes, and caps with more inrolled and sometimes undulating margins. There were only general tendencies and he was unable to detect any consistent macroscopic or microscopic features that firmly differentiate them.<ref name=Fries1985/> A [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] study comparing the [[DNA sequence]]s of specimens of ''Paxillus involutus'' collected from various habitats in [[Bavaria]] found that those collected from parks and gardens showed a close relationship with the North American species ''[[Paxillus vernalis|P.&nbsp;vernalis]]'', while those from forests were allied with ''[[Paxillus filamentosus|P.&nbsp;filamentosus]]''.

Gills further down toward the stipe become more irregular and [[Anastomosis|anastomose]], and can even resemble the pores of bolete-type fungi.

The juicy yellowish [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] has a mild to faintly sour or sharp odor and taste, and has been described as well-flavored upon cooking.<ref name=Haas1969/><ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> Of similar colour to the cap, the short [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] can be crooked and tapers toward the base.<ref name=Breitenbach1991/>\n[[File:Paxillus involutus 119527.jpg|thumb|right|Spores are ellipsoidal.]]\nThe [[spore print]] is brown, and the dimensions of the ellipsoid (oval-shaped) spores are 7.5\u20139 by 5\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]].\nThe [[hymenium]] has [[cystidia]] both on the gill edge and face (cheilo- and pleurocystidia respectively), which are slender and filament-like, typically measuring 40\u201365 by 8\u201310.5&nbsp;\u03bcm.<ref name=Bresinsky1990/>\n\n===Similar species===\nThe brownish colour and funnel-like shape of ''P.&nbsp;involutus'' can lead to its confusion with several species of ''[[Lactarius]]'', many of which have some degree of toxicity themselves.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> The lack of a milky exudate distinguishes it from any milk cap.<ref name=Lamaison2005/> One of the more similar is ''[[Lactarius turpis|L.&nbsp;turpis]]'', which presents a darker olive colouration.<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> The related North American ''Paxillus vernalis'' has a darker spore print, thicker stipe and is found under aspen,<ref name=Lincoff2008/> whereas the closer relative ''P.&nbsp;filamentosus'' is more similar in appearance to ''P.&nbsp;involutus''. A rare species that grows only in association with [[alder]], ''P.&nbsp;filamentosus'' can be distinguished from it by the pressed-down scales on the cap surface that point towards the cap margin, a light yellow flesh that bruises only slightly brown, and deep yellow-ochre gills that do not change colour upon injury<ref name=Bresinsky1990/>\n\nThe most similar species are two once thought to be part of ''P.&nbsp;involutus'' in Europe. ''Paxillus obscurosporus'' has larger fruit bodies than ''P.&nbsp;involutus'', with caps up to {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide whose margins tend to unroll and flatten with age, and a layer of cream-coloured mycelia covering the base of its tapered stipe. ''P.&nbsp;validus'', also known only from Europe, has caps up to {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide with a stipe that is more or less equal in width throughout its length. Found under broadleaved trees in parks, it can be reliably distinguished from ''P.&nbsp;involutus'' (and other ''Paxillus'' species) by the presence of crystals up to 2.5&nbsp;\u03bcm long in the [[Mycelial cord|rhizomorphs]], as the crystals found in rhizomorphs of other ''Paxillus'' species do not exceed 0.5&nbsp;\u03bcm long.<ref name=Henrici2004/>\n\n==Ecology, distribution and habitat==\n[[File:%C4%8Cechratka_podvinut%C3%A1_1.jpg|thumb|''P. involutus'' found in [[South Bohemia]], [[Czech Republic]]]]\n''Paxillus involutus'' forms [[ectomycorrhiza]]l relationships with a number of [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] and [[deciduous]] tree species. Because the fungus has somewhat unspecialized nutrient requirements and a relatively broad [[host (biology)|host]] specificity, it has been frequently used in research and seedling inoculation programs.<ref name=Taylor2000/> There is evidence of the benefit to trees of this arrangement: in one experiment where ''P.&nbsp;involutus'' was cultivated on the root exudate of red pine (''[[Pinus resinosa]]''), the root showed markedly increased resistance to pathogenic strains of the ubiquitous soil fungus ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]''.<ref name=Duchesne1988/> Seedlings inoculated with ''P.&nbsp;involutus'' also showed increased resistance to ''Fusarium''.<ref name=Duchesne1988b/> Thus ''P.&nbsp;involutus'' may be producing antifungal compounds which protect the host plants from root rot.<ref name=Duchesne1989/> ''Paxillus involutus'' also decreases the uptake of certain toxic elements, acting as a buffer against [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] toxicity in the host plant. For example, the fungus decreased the toxicity of [[cadmium]] and [[zinc]] to Scots pine (''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'') seedlings: even though cadmium itself inhibits ectomycorrhiza formation in seedlings, colonization with ''P.&nbsp;involutus'' decreases cadmium and zinc transport to the plant shoots and alters the ratio of zinc transported to the roots and shoots, causing more cadmium to be retained in the roots of the seedlings rather than distributed through its entire metabolism.<ref name=Dixon1988/> Evidence suggests that the mechanism for this detoxification involves the cadmium binding to the fungal [[cell wall]]s, as well as accumulating in the [[vacuole|vacuolar compartments]].<ref name=Marschner1998/> Further, ectomycorrhizal hyphae exposed to [[copper]]<ref name=Blaudez2000/> or cadmium drastically increase production of a [[metallothionein]]\u2014a low [[molecular weight]] protein that binds metals.<ref name=Morselt1986/><ref name=Bellion2007/>\n\nThe presence of ''Paxillus involutus'' is related to much reduced numbers of bacteria associated with the roots of ''Pinus sylvestris''. Instead bacteria are found on the external mycelium.<ref name=Nurmiaho97/> The types of bacteria change as well; a Finnish study published in 1997 found that bacterial communities under ''P.&nbsp;sylvestris'' without mycorrhizae metabolised [[organic acid|organic]] and [[amino acid]]s, while communities among ''P.&nbsp;involutus'' metabolised the sugar [[fructose]].<ref name=timonen97/> ''Paxillus involutus'' benefits from the presence of some species of bacteria in the soil it grows in. As the fungus grows it excretes [[polyphenol]]s, waste products that are toxic to itself and impede its growth, but these compounds are metabolised by some bacteria, resulting in increased fungal growth. Bacteria also produce certain compounds such as [[citric acid|citric]] and [[malic acid]], which stimulate ''P.&nbsp;involutus''.<!--these seem to refer to separate bacterial groups--><ref name=Duponnois90/>\n\n[[File:Kahler-Krempling-Paxillus-involutus.jpg|thumb|left|Found in [[Ulm, Germany]]]]\nHighly abundant,<ref name=Lamaison2005/> the brown roll-rim is found across the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia, with records from India,<ref name=Mukeriji2010/> China,<ref name=Zhishu1993/> Japan, Iran,<ref name=Asef2010/> and Turkey's eastern [[Anatolia]].<ref name=Demirel2004/> It is equally widely distributed across northern North America,<ref name=Ammirati1985/> extending north to [[Alaska]], where it has been collected from [[tundra]] near [[Coldfoot, Alaska|Coldfoot]] in the interior of the state.<ref name=Laursen2009/> In southwestern Greenland, ''P. involutus'' has been recorded under the birch species ''[[Betula nana]]'', ''[[Betula pubescens|B. pubescens]]'' and ''[[Betula glandulosa|B. glandulosa]]''.<ref name=\"knudson\"/> The mushroom is more common in coniferous woods in Europe, but is also closely associated with birch (''[[Betula pendula]]''). Within woodland, it prefers wet places or boggy ground, and avoids [[calcareous]] (chalky) soils.

Despite this, it was not until 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating ''P.&nbsp;involutus'', and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998.<ref name=Marley2010/><!-- cites previous two sentences --> The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of ''Paxillus'' mushrooms.<ref name=Flammer1985/> Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom for a long period of time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild [[gastrointestinal symptom]]s on previous occasions.<ref name=Bresinsky1990/> The ''Paxillus'' syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of [[IgG]] [[antibodies]] in the [[blood serum]]. In the course of subsequent meals, [[immune complex|antigen-antibody complexes]] are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their [[lysis|breakdown]].<ref name=Bresinsky1990/>\n\nPoisoning symptoms are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated [[hypovolemia|decreased blood volume]].<ref name=Winkelmann1986/> Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, [[hemolysis]] develops, resulting in [[oliguria|reduced urine output]], [[hemoglobinuria|hemoglobin in the urine]] or outright [[anuria|absence of urine formation]], and [[anemia]].

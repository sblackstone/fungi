It is widespread in North America, and was reported from [[Pakistan]] in 2006. The fungus grows in a [[mycorrhiza]]l association with trees from several genera, including [[fir]], [[spruce]], [[Douglas-fir]], and [[Tsuga|hemlock]]. [[Basidiocarp|Fruit bodies]] are white and large, with convex to funnel-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] measuring {{convert|7|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} wide set atop a thick [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the cap underside are closely spaced and sometimes have a faint bluish tint. [[Spore]]s are roughly spherical, and have a network-like surface dotted with warts.\n\nThe mushrooms of ''Russula brevipes'' often develop under masses of conifer needles or leaves of broadleaved trees, and fruit from summer to autumn. Forms of the mushroom that develop a bluish band at the top of the stipe are sometimes referred to as [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''acrior''. Although [[edible mushroom|edible]], ''Russula brevipes'' mushrooms have a bland or bitter flavor. They become more palatable once [[parasitism|parasitized]] by the [[ascomycete]] fungus ''[[Hypomyces lactifluorum]]'', a bright orange [[mold]] that covers the fruit body and transforms them into lobster mushrooms.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n''Russula brevipes'' was initially [[species description|described]] by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1890, from specimens collected in [[Quogue, New York]].<ref name=\"Peck 1890\"/> It is classified in the [[section (biology)|subsection]] ''Lactaroideae'', a grouping of similar ''Russula'' species characterized by having whitish to pale yellow [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], compact and hard [[trama (mycology)|flesh]], abundant lamellulae (short [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]), and the absence of [[clamp connection]]s. Other related ''Russula'' species with a similar range of [[basidiospore|spore]] ornamentation heights include ''[[Russula delica]]'', ''[[Russula romagnesiana|R.&nbsp;romagnesiana]]'', and ''[[Russula pseudodelica|R.&nbsp;pseudodelica]]''.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1964\"/>\n\nThere has been considerable confusion in the literature over the naming of ''Russula brevipes''. Some early 20th-century American mycologists referred to it as ''Russula delica'', although that fungus was described from Europe by [[Elias Fries]] with a description not accurately matching the North American counterparts. Fries's concept of ''R.&nbsp;delica'' included: a white fruit body that did not change color; a smooth, shiny cap; and thin, widely spaced gills. To add to the confusion, [[Rolf Singer]] and later [[Robert K\u00fchner]] and [[Henri Romagnesi]] described other species they named ''Russula delica''. Robert Shaffer summarized the [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] conundrum in 1964: <blockquote>''Russula delica'' is a species that everybody knows, so to speak, but the evidence indicates that ''R.&nbsp;delica'' sensu Fries (1838) is not ''R.&nbsp;delica'' sensu Singer (1938), which in turn is not ''R.&nbsp;delica'' sensu K\u00fchner and Romagnesi (1953)\u2026&nbsp;It is best to use ''R.&nbsp;brevipes'' for the North American collections which most authors but not K\u00fchner and Romagnesi (1953), call ''R.&nbsp;delica''. The name, ''R.&nbsp;brevipes'', is attached to a type collection, has a reasonably explicit original description, and provides a stable point about which a species concept can be formed.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1964\"/></blockquote>\n\nShaffer defined the ''Russula brevipes'' [[variety (botany)|varieties]] ''acrior'' and ''megaspora'' in 1964 from [[California]]n specimens. The former is characterized by a greenish-blue band that forms at the top of the stipe, while the latter variety has large spores.<ref name=\"Shaffer 1964\"/> The nomenclatural database [[Index Fungorum]] does not consider these varieties to have independent taxonomical significance.<ref name=\"urlFungorum synonymy: Russula brevipes\"/> In a 2012 publication, mycologist Mike Davis and colleagues suggest that western North American ''Russula brevipes'' comprise a [[species complex|complex]] of at least four distinct species.<ref name=\"Davis 2012\"/> According to [[MycoBank]], the European species ''[[Russula chloroides]]'' is synonymous with ''R.&nbsp;brevipes'',<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Russula brevipes\"/> although Index Fungorum and other sources consider them distinct species.\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''brevipes'' is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''brevis'' \"short\" and ''pes'' \"foot\", hence \"short-footed\".<ref name=\"Simpson 1979\"/> [[Common name]]s used to refer to the mushroom include short-stemmed russula,<ref name=\"Ostry 2011\"/> short-stalked white russula,<ref name=\"Courtecuisse 1999\"/> and stubby brittlegill.<ref name=\"McKnight 1987\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Russula brevipes 380443.jpg|thumb|left|A greenish band can develop at the top of the stipe.|alt=Closeup of a white mushroom, showing a bluish-green band of color at the intersection of the gills and stipe.]]\nFully grown, the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] can range from {{convert|7|to|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter, whitish to dull-yellow, and is funnel-shaped with a central depression.

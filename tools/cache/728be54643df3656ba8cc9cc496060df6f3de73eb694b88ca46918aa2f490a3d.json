The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] produced by the fungus are characterized by a sticky, vanilla-colored [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide with a mixture of yellow tones arranged in faint concentric bands. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and has yellow-brown spots. When it is cut or injured, the mushroom oozes a white [[latex]], which has an intensely peppery taste. The acrid taste of the fruit bodies renders them unpalatable. The fungus is found in the western United States and Mexico, where it grows in [[mycorrhiza]]l associations with various [[coniferous]] trees species, such as [[spruce]], [[pine]] and [[fir]], and [[deciduous]] species such as [[oak]] and [[alder]]. It has also been collected in India. Two [[variety (botany)|varieties]] have been named: var. ''pitkinensis'', known from [[Colorado]], and var. ''pungens'', from [[Michigan]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was originally described by American mycologist [[Alexander H. Smith]] in 1960, from a collection made near [[Warm Lake]], [[Idaho]], two years prior. The species was originally collected under [[alder]]s with [[conifer]]s nearby, and its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] reflects the presumed association between the species<ref name=Hesler1960/>\u2014''alnicola'' means \"living with alder\".<ref name=Gledhill2008/> Researchers subsequently discovered that the species has a relationship with conifers, not with alders, as the name implies.<ref name=\"Bessette pp. 145-46\">Bessette ''et al''., 2009, pp. 145\u201346.</ref> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"golden milkcap\".<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n''Lactarius alnicola'' is classified in subsection ''Scrobiculati'' of [[section (biology)|section]] ''Piperites'' in the genus ''[[Lactarius]]''. Species in this subsection are characterized by having a milk-white to creamy or whey-like [[latex]] that soon turns yellow upon exposure to air, and which may stain freshly cut surfaces of the fruit body yellow. Further, the cap margin is bearded, [[wikt:strigose|strigose]] (covered with sharp, straight, and stiff hairs), and coarsely [[tomentose]] or woolly when young. Other species in the subsection include ''[[Lactarius subpaludosus|L.&nbsp;subpaludosus]]'', ''[[Lactarius delicatus|L.&nbsp;delicatus]]'', ''[[Lactarius torminosus|L.&nbsp;torminosus]]'', ''[[Lactarius payettensis|L.&nbsp;payettensis]]'', ''[[Lactarius gossypinus|L.&nbsp;gossypinus]]'', ''[[Lactarius pubescens|L.&nbsp;pubescens]]'', ''[[Lactarius resimus|L.&nbsp;resimus]]'' and ''[[Lactarius scrobiculatus|L.&nbsp;scrobiculatus]]'' (the [[type species]] of the subsection).<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1979, p. 237; pp. 285\u201386.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lactarius alnicola 34217.jpg|thumb|left|The gills are forked near the stem.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|8|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, initially convex but becoming depressed to funnel-shaped in maturity. The cap margin is initially rolled inward, then becomes uplifted as the cap expands. The cap surface is sticky to slimy, and near the margin there are matted \"hairs\" beneath the slimy or sticky layer. The color of the cap surface is yellow-[[ochre]], sometimes with concentric bands of lighter and darker shades; the color becomes paler near the margin. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] (squarely attached to the stem) to [[wikt:decurrent|decurrent]] (attached to and running down the length of the stem), narrow, and crowded closely together. Forked near the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], the gills are initially whitish before becoming pale ochraceous-[[buff (color)|buff]]. There are many lamellulae\u2014small gills that do not extend completely to the stem.<ref name=\"Bessette pp. 145-46\"/><ref name=Arora1986/>\n\nThe stem is {{convert|3|\u2013|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, nearly equal in width throughout or tapered downward, dry, hard, coarsely pitted, and whitish to cream yellowish. It is initially solid, then becomes hollow with age. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick, hard, whitish, and slowly stains pale yellow after the mushroom has been cut open. It has no distinctive odor, while the taste is immediately [[wikt:acrid|acrid]]. The [[latex]] is sparse, white on exposure to air, and unchanging or very slowly changing color to yellow. It stains cut flesh yellow, and tastes acrid.<ref name=\"Bessette pp. 145-46\"/> According to mycologist [[David Arora]], the oak-loving central and southern Californian population of this species has a more latent acrid taste.<ref name=Arora1986/> The [[spore print]] may range slightly in color: thin deposits are white, thick deposits are more yellow.<ref name=\"H&S300-304\"/> The mushroom is considered inedible because of the intensely peppery taste.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Lactarius alnicola\"/>\n\n===Microscopic characters===\n[[File:Lactarius alnicola 6958.jpg|thumb|right|Spores of ''L. alnicola'', viewed at 1000x; 10 divisions equal 9.75&nbsp;\u00b5m.]]\nThe [[spore]]s are 7.5\u201310 by 6\u20138.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]], [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and ornamented with warts and narrow bands that form a partial reticulum.<ref name=\"Bessette pp. 145-46\"/> The surface prominences are up to 1&nbsp;\u00b5m high, but mostly in the range 0.3&ndash;0.6&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=\"H&S300-304\"/> The spores are [[hyaline]] (translucent) and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning that they will adsorb [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells, are four-spored, and measure 37\u201348 by 8\u201311&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is an [[wikt:ixocutis|ixocutis]] (a tissue layer on the surface of a mushroom made of a layer of gelatinous [[hypha]]e) made of encrusted hyphae that are 3\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m wide.<ref name=\"Bessette pp. 145-46\"/>\n\n===Varieties===\nIn their 1979 [[monograph]] of North American ''Lactarius'' species, [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler|Hesler]] and Smith named two [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of ''L.&nbsp;alnicola''. ''Lactarius alnicola'' var. ''pitkinensis'', reported under mixed aspen and conifers from [[Ashcroft, Colorado]], is very similar to the nominate variety, but it has a white to cream-colored cap and white, unchanging latex. It has slightly smaller fruit bodies, with caps up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, and stems up to {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; its spores are slightly larger, measuring 9\u201310.5 by 7.5\u20139&nbsp;\u00b5m. ''Lactarius alnicola'' var. ''pungens'', reported only from mixed forests in [[Michigan]], is similar but has a tacky surface that soon dries, a dull ochraceous to ochraceous-tan cap with an ochraceous-[[tawny (color)|tawny]] center. It has whitish flesh, with a pungent odor described as \"distinct and peculiar\".<ref name=\"H&S300-304\">Hesler and Smith, 1979, pp. 300\u201304.</ref>\n\n===Similar species===\n[[File:Chanterelle.jpg|thumb|right|''Cantharellus cibarius'']]\nNovice mushroom hunters may mistake ''L.&nbsp;alnicola'' for the [[edible mushroom|edible]] species ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'',<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Lactarius alnicola\"/> a choice [[edible mushroom|edible]] species  that has a vase-shaped fruit body with strongly decurrent gills.<ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Cantharellus cibarius\"/> Other similar ''Lactarius'' species include  ''[[Lactarius zonarius|L.&nbsp;zonarius]]'', ''[[Lactarius payettensis|L.&nbsp;payettensis]]'', ''[[Lactarius yazooensis|L.&nbsp;yazooensis]]'', ''[[Lactarius olympianus|L.&nbsp;olympianus]]'', and [[Lactarius psammicola|''L.&nbsp;psammicola'' f. ''glaber'']].<ref name=Candusso1994/> ''L.&nbsp;olympianus'' also associates with conifers, and has a pale yellow-ochre, frequently [[zonate]] cap, but may be distinguished by its stem, which is usually covered with spots.<ref name=Evenson1997/> ''L.&nbsp;payettensis'' has a roughened, not smooth, cap margin.<ref name=\"urlLactarius payettensis (MushroomExpert.Com)\"/> ''L.&nbsp;yazooensis'' has a zonate cap and extremely acrid flesh. Its gills change color from pale [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]  to light pinkish-brown in maturity.<ref>Bessette ''et al''., 2009, p. 268.</ref> ''L.&nbsp;psammicola'' f. ''glaber'' has a pinkish-buff spore print.<ref>Bessette ''et al''., 2009, p. 222.</ref> Mature fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;scrobiculatus'' var. ''montanus'' have been confused with ''L.&nbsp;alnicola''. Its fruit bodies feature a smooth cap margin, acrid taste, white latex which slowly (over several minutes) turns yellow on exposure or stains the flesh yellow, and do not turn \"clay color\" when bruised.<ref name=Methven1985/>\n\n==Ecology, habitat, and distribution==\n''Lactarius alnicola'' is an [[Mycorrhiza#Types of mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] species, and engages in a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] association with certain plant species. In this association, the [[hypha]]e of the fungus permeate large volumes of soil and obtain scarce [[chemical element|elements]], especially [[phosphorus]]\u2014which is often limiting for plant growth\u2014which they pass on to the plant in exchange for metabolic products of the plant's [[photosynthesis]]. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with ''[[Picea engelmannii]]'' have been shown to contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and [[pigment]]s similar to the fruit body.<ref name=Kernaghan1997/> Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under [[alder]]s and [[conifer]]s, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States<ref name=\"Bessette pp. 145-46\"/> and [[Baja California]].<ref name=Candusso1994/> Additional collection locations in Mexico include [[Veracruz]], [[Villarreal, Nuevo Le\u00f3n|Villarreal]], and [[Tapia, Oaxaca|Tapia]].<ref name=Montoya1996/> A population in central and southern California is known to associate with [[oak]] trees.<ref name=Arora1986/> In the [[Rocky Mountains]] it is associated with the [[subalpine]] tree species Englemann Spruce (''[[Picea engelmannii]]''), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]'').<ref name=Currah1989/> It is also known to associate with Ponderosa Pine (''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'') and Douglas-fir (genus ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'').<ref name=Barroetavena12007/> The mushroom has also been collected from [[Bageshwar]], in the state of [[Uttarakhand]], India.<ref name=Mukeriji2010/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Lactarius species|List of ''Lactarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |pages=71\u201372|isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86tM01VsFG0C&pg=PA72}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Barroetavena12007>{{cite journal |vauthors=Barroetave\u00f1a C, C\u00e1zares E, Rajchenberg M |year=2007 |title=Ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir: a comparison of species richness in native western North American forests and Patagonian plantations from Argentina |journal=Mycorrhiza |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=355\u201373 |pmid=17345105 |doi=10.1007/s00572-007-0121-x}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Candusso1994>{{cite journal |vauthors=Candusso M, Gennari A, Ayala N |year=1994 |title=Agaricales of Baja California \u2013 Mexico |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=50 |pages=175\u201388  |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0050/0175.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Currah1989>{{Cite report |title=Cultural and taxonomic studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with lodgepole pine and white spruce in Alberta |url= |vauthors=Currah RS, Sigler L, Abbott S, Flis A |year=1989 |publisher=Alberta Forest Development Research Trust Report, Devonian Botanic Garden, University of Alberta}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Gledhill2008>{{cite book |author=Gledhill D. |title=The Names of Plants |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2008 |page=43 |isbn=978-0-521-86645-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ6PyhVuecwC&pg=PA43}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Evenson1997>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms of Colorado and the Southern Rocky Mountains |last=Evenson VS. |year=1997 |publisher=Westcliffe Publishers |location= |isbn=978-1-56579-192-3 |page=79 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAeDeyqZLq0C&pg=PA80}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Hesler1960>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hesler LR, Smith AH |year=1960 |title=Studies of ''Lactarius'' \u2013 II.

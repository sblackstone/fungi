Described as new to science in 1971, it is commonly known as the '''manzanita bolete''' for its usual [[mycorrhiza]]l association with [[manzanita]] trees. Its [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] (mushrooms) have sticky reddish to brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and its [[stipe (mycology)|stipes]] are up to {{convert|16|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick. They have a whitish background color punctuated with small black scales known as ''scabers''. Found only in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the United States and Canada, it is the most common ''[[Leccinum]]'' species in [[California]]. The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], although opinions vary as to its quality. ''L.&nbsp;manzanitae'' can be usually distinguished from other similar bolete mushrooms by its large size, reddish cap, dark scabers on a whitish stipe, and association with manzanita and [[madrone]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n''Leccinum manzanitae'' was first [[species description|described]] by the American mycologist [[Harry Delbert Thiers]] in 1971, from collections made in [[San Mateo County, California]], the previous year. In that state, it is known as the manzanita bolete because of its close association with manzanita trees. It is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in subsection ''Versicolores'' of the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Leccinum'' in the genus ''Leccinum''.<ref name=\"Thiers 1971\"/> Closely related species in this section include ''[[Leccinum piceinum|L.&nbsp;piceinum]]'', ''[[Leccinum monticola|L.&nbsp;monticola]]'', ''[[Leccinum albostipitatum|L.&nbsp;albostipitatum]]'', and ''[[Leccinum versipelle|L.&nbsp;versipelle]]''.<ref name=\"Den Bakker 2007\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Leccinum manzanitae 126166.jpg|thumb|left|The pore surface is whitish, with pores up to 1&nbsp;mm broad.]]\nThe fruit bodies of ''Leccinum manzanitae'' are sometimes massive, occasionally reaching weights of several pounds.<ref name=\"Thiers 1975\"/> The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|7|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, spherical to convex when young, and broadly convex to flattened or cushion-shaped (pulvinate).<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/> The surface of the cap is often shallowly to deeply pitted or reticulate, sticky, and covered with pressed-down hairs that are more conspicuous toward the edge of the cap. Its color is dark red during all stages of development. The cap's [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is {{convert|2|\u2013|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, white when first exposed, but slowly and irregularly changing to dark brownish-gray with no reddish intermediate state. The change in color upon bruising or injury is often more pronounced in young specimens.<ref name=\"Thiers 1971\"/>\n\nThe tubes comprising the [[hymenophore]] are {{convert|1|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, with an [[adnation|adnate]] attachment to the stipe; their color is pale olive when young and darkens when bruised. Pores are up to 1&nbsp;mm in diameter, angular, and the same color as the tubes. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|10|\u2013|16|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|1.5|\u2013|3.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick at the apex, and either club-shaped or swollen in the middle. It is solid (i.e., not hollow), with a dry surface, and covered with small, stiff, granular projections called scabers.<ref name=\"Thiers 1971\"/> The scabers are usually whitish when young, but eventually turn dark brownish-grey with age. The stipe flesh stains a bluish color when bruised,<ref name=\"Davis 2012\"/> although this reaction is variable and sometimes slow to occur.<ref name=\"Thiers 1975\"/> It has no distinctive taste or odor.<ref name=\"Bessette 2000\"/>\n[[File:Leccinum manzanitae 190001.jpg|thumb|right|Spores are somewhat elliptical to cylindrical and tapered on each end.]]\n''Leccinum manzanitae'' mushroom produce a cinnamon-brown [[spore print]]. [[basidiospores|Spores]] are 13\u201317 by 4\u20135.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]], somewhat elliptical to cylindrical, and tapered on each end (fusoid); their walls are smooth and moderately thick. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are 27\u201332 by 6\u20139&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped to pear-shaped (pyriform) and four-spored. The [[cystidia]] are 23\u201332 by 4\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m, fusoid to club-shaped with narrow, elongated apices. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe surface) are thin-walled, club-shaped to somewhat fusoid, and sometimes end in a sharp point; they measure 35\u201345 by 9\u201314&nbsp;\u00b5m. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent in the [[hypha]]e of ''Leccinum manzanitae''.<ref name=\"Thiers 1971\"/> The hyphae of the [[cap cuticle]] are arranged in the form of a trichoderm (wherein the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, perpendicular to the cap surface).<ref name=\"Desjardin 2014\"/>\n\nSeveral [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical tests]] can be used to help confirm the identify of the mushroom: a drop of dilute (3\u201310%) [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solution will turn the tubes pale red whereas [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) on the tubes produces orange-yellow; a solution of [[Iron(II) sulfate]] (FeSO<sub>4</sub>) applied to the flesh results in a pale grey color.<ref name=\"Thiers 1971\"/>\n\nThiers also described the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''L.&nbsp;manzanitae'' var. ''angustisporae'' from [[Mendocino County]]. Similar to the main form in appearance and habitat, it has smaller, narrowly elongated spores, typically 3\u20134&nbsp;\u00b5m wide and 1\u20132&nbsp;\u00b5m longer.<ref name=\"Thiers 1971\"/>\n\n===Edibility===\n\n''Leccinum manzanitae'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]], and its taste is sometimes rated highly,<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/> although others have described the flavor as bland.<ref name=\"Arora 1991\"/> Drying the mushroom may improve the flavor.<ref name=\"Arora 1991\"/><ref name=\"urlCalifornia Fungi: Leccinum manzanitae\"/> One field guide advises caution when selecting this species for the table, as there have been poisonings reported with similar-looking mushrooms found in the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the United States.<ref name=\"Ammirati 2009\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| footer = ''Leccinum ponderosum'' (left) and ''L.&nbsp;scabrum'' (right) are two of several lookalike species that might be mistaken for ''L.&nbsp;manzanitae''.\n| align = right\n| image1 = Leccinum ponderosum 23793.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (175 * 768 / 565) round 0}}\n| image2 = Leccinum scabrum 117467.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (175 * 2233 / 2881) round 0}}\n}}\n\nIn the field, ''Leccinum manzanitae'' fruit bodies can be usually distinguished from those of other similar bolete species by its large size, reddish cap, dark scabers on a whitish stipe, and association with manzanita and madrone.<ref name=\"Davis 2012\"/> ''[[Leccinum ponderosum|L.&nbsp;ponderosum]]'' also has a dark red sticky cap, but its flesh does not darken upon exposure, and its cap is smooth when young.<ref name=\"Thiers 1971\"/> ''[[Leccinum armeniacum|L.&nbsp;armeniacum]]'' also grows with manzanita and madrone, but its cap is more orange.<ref name=\"Arora 1991\"/> ''[[Leccinum aeneum|L.&nbsp;aeneum]]'', known only from California, is another species that associates with manzanitae and madrone.

It associates with [[toyon]] (''Heteromeles arbutifolia'').<ref name=\"Desjardin 2014\"/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\n''Leccinum manzanitae'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species. Its fruit bodies grow singly to scattered in soil under [[madrone]] and [[manzanita]].

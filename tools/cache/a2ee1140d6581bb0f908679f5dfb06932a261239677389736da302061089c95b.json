According to modern taxonomic analysis it is just one of a cluster of closely similar species which are often referred to as the ''Agrocybe praecox'' complex. It is found in Europe, North Africa and North America.\n\n==Description==\n''A. praecox'' belongs to a group of species which are difficult to distinguish consistently.  The following description combines several references.<ref name=Bon/><ref name=Courtecuisse/><ref name=FN/><ref name=Moser/>\n\n*'''Cap''': up to 8&nbsp;cm, convex, smooth, beige when dry and yellowish brown when imbued with moisture.  Veil remnants are often visible around the rim.\n*'''Gills''': Initially whitish, later dark brown.\n*'''Stem''': Pale; 4 to 7&nbsp;cm (occasionally up to around 10&nbsp;cm); quite thick (to about 1&nbsp;cm) with a fragile ring.  Often with [[mycelial cords]] at the base.\n*'''Odor and taste''': Floury.<ref name=Courtecuisse/><ref name=FN/>  Taste may be bitter.<ref name=Bon/>\n*'''Spores''': 8 - 10 x 5 - 7 [[\u03bcm]],<ref name=FN/> ellipsoid, dark brown (en masse).\n*'''Habitat''': Gregarious in grass or on wood debris in woods, gardens, or other contexts.  Like other ''Agrocybes'', it is a [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophyte]].\n*'''Season''': Often observed in spring, but can also occur in summer and autumn.\n\n==Taxonomy and Related Species==\nThe mushroom was first described by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon|Persoon]] in 1800 as ''Agaricus praecox''.  In 1889 [[Victor Fayod|Fayod]] devised the new genus ''Agrocybe'' and made ''A. praecox'' the [[type species]].<ref name=IF/>\n\nThe Latin epithet ''praecox'' \"early\" is related to the word \"precocious\" and refers to the fact that this species often appears early in the year.\n\nA 1990 study by Timothy Flynn and O. K. Miller finds that ''A. praecox'' is one of four species which are indistinguishable using superficial characteristics but which can be separated through their habitat and location.<ref name=FlynnMiller/><ref name=Kuo/>  If this proposal is accepted, the cluster consists of ''A. molesta'' and three other species which do not yet have proper names, but which are referred to as \"Flynn & Miller Species I - III\".  The three provisional species correspond to the older names ''A. acericola'', ''A. elatella'', ''A. praecox'', and ''A. sphaleromorpha'' combined; and their synonyms.<ref name=FN/><ref name=ChampQuebec/>  According to the traditional system, various detailed morphological characteristics can be used to choose between the species, but such is variation amongst individuals that it is difficult to achieve a consistent identification in this way.\n\nThe following table summarizes the names of species which are closely related to ''A. praecox''.

It is known to contain [[amatoxin]]s and consuming this fungus can be a potentially lethal proposition. It was described by French mycologist [[Lucien Qu\u00e9let]] in 1881.\n\nIt has white gills and spores. They typically have rings on the stems, which in larger fungi are detachable and glide up and down the stem.\n\nIt can be found in coniferous and deciduous woodlands, mostly singly or in small groups.\n\n==Description==\n\nThe cap is broadly bell shaped to flat, dark red-brown; soon splitting and scaly, up to 3&nbsp;cm in diameter.\nThe spores and flesh are white, with a mild taste. The stem is typically chestnut brown.\n\n==Toxicity==\n\nLike several other species of the genus ''Lepiota'', it contains [[amatoxin]]s which can result in severe liver toxicity.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of deadly fungi]]\n* [[List of Lepiota species|List of ''Lepiota'' species]]\n\n==References==\n*E.

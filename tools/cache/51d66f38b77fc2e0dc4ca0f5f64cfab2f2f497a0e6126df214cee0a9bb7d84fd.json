In North America, it is sometimes referred to by the common name '''red-capped scaber stalk'''. Some uncertainties exist regarding the taxonomic classification of this species in Europe and North America. It is considered edible.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is orange-red and measures up to 8 in (20&nbsp;cm) across. Its [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, bruising at first burgundy, then grayish or purple-black. The underside of the cap has very small, whitish [[Hymenium|pores]] that bruise olive-brown. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures 4-7 in (10-18&nbsp;cm) tall and to \u00be-1\u00bc in (2-3&nbsp;cm) thick and can bruise blue-green. It is whitish, with short, rigid projections or [[wikt:scaber|scabers]] that turn to brown to black with age.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''L. aurantiacum'' can be found fruiting during summer and autumn in forests throughout Europe and North America. The association between fungus and host tree is [[mycorrhiza]]l. In Europe, it has traditionally been associated with poplar trees. Some debate exists about the classification of ''L. aurantiacum'' and ''[[Leccinum quercinum|L. quercinum]]'' as separate species. According to authors who do not recognise the distinction, ''L. aurantiacum'' is also found among oak trees. Additionally, ''L. aurantiacum'' has been recorded with various other [[deciduous]] trees, including beech, birch, chestnut, willow, and trees of the genus ''[[Tilia]]''.<ref name=Noordeloos>{{cite web | title=The genus ''Leccinum'' in Western and Central Europe | publisher=Noordeloos M. | url=http://www.entoloma.nl/html/leccinum_eng.html#aurantiacum | accessdate=July 8, 2010}}</ref> ''L. aurantiacum'' is not known to associate with conifers in Europe.\n\nNorth American populations have been recorded in [[coniferous]] and deciduous forests, though whether collections from coniferous forests are not ''[[Leccinum vulpinum|L. vulpinum]]'', instead, remains uncertain. In addition, ''L. aurantiacum'' may be absent altogether from North America, with collections from deciduous forests being attributed to other North American species ''[[Leccinum insigne|L. insigne]]'', and ''[[Leccinum brunneum|L. brunneum]]''.<ref name=mushroomexpert>{{cite web | title=''Leccinum'': Uncertain taxa. | publisher=Kuo M | url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/leccinum_uncertain.html | accessdate=July 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Use==\nThis is a favorite species for eating and can be prepared as other edible [[bolete]]s. Its flesh turns very dark on cooking. Like most members of the Boletaceae, these mushrooms are targeted by [[maggot]]s. Due to a number of poisonings and the difficulty identifying species, ''Leccinum'' species are considered by some as possibly not safe to eat. This species also needs to be cooked well (not parboiled) or else it may cause vomiting or other negative effects. This species can cause problems with digestion if not cooked properly.\n\n==Similar species==\nIn Europe, several orange-red capped species exist, which differ mainly in habitat. ''[[Leccinum albostipitatum|L. albostipitatum]]'' grows with aspen and has white scales on the stipe. In coniferous forests, ''[[Leccinum vulpinum|L. vulpinum]]'' occurs around pine and spruce trees. Not all authors recognise these as distinct species.\n\nIn North America, ''L. insigne'' grows in aspen or birch stands, while ''[[Leccinum atrostipitatum|L. atrostipitatum]]'' grows in birch stands. Both are edible.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Leccinum species|List of ''Leccinum'' species]]\n*[[List of North American boletes]]\n\n==References==\n[[File:Leccinum aurantiacum EHM6.JPG|thumb|right|''L. aurantiacum'' in Massachusetts, USA]]\n* ''National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms'', Knopf, 1981.\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat}}\n*''[http://www.mushroomexpert.com/leccinum_aurantiacum.html Leccinum aurantiacum]'' at MushroomExpert.com\n*''[http://www.mykoweb.com/boletes/species/Leccinum_aurantiacum.html Leccinum aurantiacum]'' at MykoWeb\n*''[http://leslieland.com/2009/07/wild-mushroom-warning-the-scaber-stalks-leccinum-species-may-no-longer-be-considered-safe Leccinum aurantiacum]'' Leccinum Species May No Longer Be Considered Safe\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q4329061}}\n\n[[Category:Leccinum|aurantiacum]]\n[[Category:Edible fungi]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Europe]]\n[[Category:Fungi of Asia]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]"}]}}}}

Occurring in [[Europe]] in spring, ''A. verna'' [[Mycorrhiza|associates]] with various deciduous and coniferous trees. The [[Pileus (mycology)|caps]], [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]s and [[Lamella (mycology)|gill]]s are all white in colour.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Amanita verna'' was first mentioned in the scientific literature by French mycologist  [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Jean Bulliard]] in 1780 as [[form (botany)|form]] ''vernus'' of ''Agaricus bulbosus''. Bulliard warned that it could be easily confused with the edible field mushroom (''[[Agaricus campestris]]''), and that remedies for those who had eaten it included putting vitriolic ether in wine or crushed garlic in milk.<ref name=\"Bulliard 1780\"/> The species name ''verna'' is derived from the Latin word for \"spring\". Three years later, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] gave it distinct species status in his ''Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique, Botanique''.<ref name=\"Lamarck 1783\"/>\n\nThe fool's mushroom (''Amanita verna''), also known as the spring destroying angel or death angel, is a close relative of ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'', the death cap, and a member of the mushroom genus ''[[Amanita]]''. ''Amanita verna'', like its close relative, belongs to the subfamily Phalloideae.\n\n==Description==\nThe fool's mushroom is pure white, all the way to the gills and the stipe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/sept97.html|title=This month's fungus is the death angel, Amanita bisporigera, Amanita virosa, and Amanita verna|accessdate=December 27, 2012}}</ref> This fungus, like all amanitas, has a [[Volva (mycology)|volva]]. The fool's mushroom's cap is {{convert|5|-|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, and is about the same height.\n\nThis mushroom's lamellae is free and white, and the volva is bag-like and large. Its [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]] is white and membranous, and ''A. verna'' react yellow with 20% [[potassium hydroxide]] solution, unlike its relative\n''[[Amanita phalloides var. alba]]'' while [[Amanita virosa]] gets an orangeyellow reaction. The mushroom's spores are smooth and elliptical.<ref name=Kinoko-Ya_MrMushrooms_Amanitaverna>{{cite web|url=http://kinoko-ya.sakura.ne.jp/01eng3/amanita_verna.htm|title=Amanita verna|last=Takahashi|first=Hiroshi|language=English, Japanese|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref>\n\n==Habitat and season==\nThe fool's mushroom grows in European woodlands and hardwood forests in springtime as the fungus' Latin name (Amanita verna or spring destroying angel) suggests.<ref name=Kinoko-Ya_MrMushrooms_Amanitaverna/>\n\nUnlike various closely related poisonous amanitas, this mushroom is not known to occur in [[North America]].\n\n==Toxicity==\nClosely related to other deadly pure white amanitas, the fool's mushroom is one of the most poisonous mushrooms in the world. Just like the death cap, this organism contains  a fatal dose of [[alpha-amanitin]], which causes liver failure if not treated immediately. While this mushroom (along with many other deadly and edible fungi) also contains [[phallotoxins]], these phallotoxins are not toxic to humans (when ingested) as they are poorly absorbed.\n\nThis mushroom's toxicity and symptoms are similar, if not identical to that of the death cap. Like other members of the subfamily Phalloideae, the fool's mushroom has been implicated in a number of serious or fatal poisonings.\n\nThere are no negative symptoms from eating this fungus until 6\u201324 hours after ingestion. The first symptom is simply unease. Violent cramps and diarrhea follow. On the third day, the same symptoms repeat themselves, but while to many this may seem like a sign of recovery, most of the time it is simply a herald of the final onset of symptoms, which include kidney and liver failure due to amatoxins. At this point, drastic measures like liver transplants need to be taken, or the victim would most likely die.<ref name=UWisc_DepartmentofBotany_TomsFungi_Sep1997>{{cite web|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/sept97.html|title=Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for September 1997|last=Volk|first=Tom|date=1997-09-01|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]]|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n* [[Amanitin]]\n* [[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n* [[List of deadly fungi]]\n* [[Mushroom poisoning]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bulliard 1780\">{{cite book |title=Herbier de la France.

The species produces brown [[mushrooms]] with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of varying shapes up to {{convert|40|mm|in}} across, and tall, thin [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|62|mm|in}} long. At the base of the stem is a large and well-defined \"bulb\". The species produces unusually shaped, irregular [[spore]]s, each with a few thick protrusions. This feature helps differentiate it from other species that would otherwise be similar in appearance and [[habit (biology)|habit]].\n\n''Inocybe saliceticola'' grows in [[mycorrhizal]] association with [[willow]] trees, and it is for this that the species is named. However, particular species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include [[beech]] and [[alder]] taxa. The mushrooms grow from the ground, often among mosses or [[detritus]]. ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'' was first described in 2009, and within the genus ''Inocybe'', the species is a part of the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Marginatae''. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Inocybe saliceticola'' was first [[species description|described]] in 2009 by Jukka Vauras and Katri Kokkonen in the journal ''[[Karstenia (journal)|Karstenia]]'', based on around 20 specimens from Finland, the majority of which were collected by the authors.<ref name=p57>Vauras and Kokkonen 2009, p. 57.</ref> The [[holotype]] was collected from the shore of lake [[Pahakala]], near [[Nurmes]]. The [[Botanical name|specific name]] ''saliceticola'' is in reference to the fact that the species grows among [[willow]] (''Salix'').<ref name=p58/> Within the genus ''[[Inocybe]]'', ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'' belongs to the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Marginatae'', as defined by [[Rolf Singer]].<ref name=p66/> The section has been defined in several ways. It was established in 1933 by [[Robert K\u00fchner]], who identified two key characteristics: a [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] which does not feature a cortina (a fragile, cobweb-like [[partial veil]]) but is entirely covered by [[cystidia]], and the presence of a [[wikt:marginate|marginate]] \"bulb\" at the base of the stem. Singer emended the section in 1986 to take into account that a bulb is not always present.<ref>Kobayashi and Courtecuisse 2000, p. 166.</ref> A slightly different infrageneric taxonomy was offered by Thom Kuyper in 1986. He, like Singer, grouped ''Marginatae'' under ''Inocybe'' [[subgenus|subg.]] ''Inocybe'', but he labelled it a \"supersection\".<ref>Matheny ''et al.'' 2002, table 1.</ref> However, phylogenetic studies have indicated that neither Singer's section ''Marginatae'' nor Kuyper's \"supersection\" ''Marginatae'' truly form [[monophyletic groups]], but that Singer's section comes closer to doing so.<ref>Matheny ''et al.'' 2002, p. 697; Ryberg ''et al.'', p. 440.</ref> Species within ''Marginatae'' similar to ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'' include ''[[Inocybe obtusiuscula|I.&nbsp;obtusiuscula]]'', ''[[Inocybe dunensis|I.&nbsp;dunensis]]'', ''[[Inocybe salicis-herbaceae|I.&nbsp;salicis-herbaceae]]'', ''[[Inocybe substellata|I.&nbsp;substellata]]'', ''[[Inocybe praetervisa|I.&nbsp;praetervisa]]'', ''[[Inocybe salicis|I.&nbsp;salicis]]'' and ''[[Inocybe mixtilis|I.&nbsp;mixtilis]]''. These species are all known to associate with willow, and all have macroscopic similarities.<ref name=p66>Vauras and Kokkonen 2009, p. 66.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n{{ mycomorphbox\n| name             = ''Inocybe saliceticola''\n| whichGills       = adnate\n| capShape         = convex\n| capShape2        = umbonate\n| hymeniumType     = gills\n| stipeCharacter   = bare\n| ecologicalType   = mycorrhizal\n}}\n''Incoybe saliceticola'' produces [[mushroom]]s with [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s of between {{convert|7|and|40|mm|in}} in diameter. The shape of the cap varies, depending on the age of the mushroom. In younger specimens, they are conical or nearly so, but as the mushroom matures, the caps flatten into a more convex or flat shape. As such, the height of the cap varies from {{convert|4|to|11|mm|in}}. The cap features an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] that is usually very prominent. Around the umbo, the cap surface is smooth, but towards the cap margin, the surface is defined by [[fibrils]] running from the margin towards the umbo. The cap sometimes splits along these. The cap's colour varies from yellow-brown to pale brown, and is palest at the margins. The umbo contrasts to this somewhat, being a grey-brown or red-brown. The slender [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures from {{convert|0.7|to|6.2|cm|in|abbr=off}} long by {{convert|1.5|to|6.5|mm|in}} thick. It thickens slightly towards the base, where it joins a large, well-defined \"bulb\" that can be up to {{convert|11|mm|in}} across. Shallow grooves run up the surface of the stem, which is covered in a fine white powder.<ref name=p58/> In one case, however, an atypical specimen was recovered with an almost completely smooth stem, free of striations or powder.<ref name=p66/> The stem varies in colour, with whitish, pale yellow-brown, pale red-brown, pale brown and grey-brown all observed, while the base is white. No [[Partial veil|veil]] or [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] is visible.<ref name=p58>Vauras and Kokkonen 2009, p. 58.</ref>\n\nThe fairly crowded [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate, meaning that they attach to the stem through their entire depth. They are a pale grey to pale grey-brown when young, darkening to grey-brown as they mature. The gill edges, which are slightly [[wiktionary:fimbriate|fimbriate]], are the same colour or paler. The [[Context (mycology)|flesh]] lacks any strong or distinctive smell or taste, and is described in the original description as \"fungoid\". In the cap, the flesh varies in colour from whitish to a pale brown-grey or pale yellow, while in the stem, it is the same colour as the stem surface or slightly paler.<ref name=p58/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\n[[File:Inocybe saliceticola spores.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The distinctive spores of ''I. saliceticola''. Note the irregular protrusions.]]\nThe irregularly shaped [[spore]]s measure from 7.2 to 11.6 by 5.1 to 7.9 [[micrometre]]s (\u03bcm), each featuring a few thick protusions.<ref name=p58/> Abnormal spores of a different shape, sometimes with protrusions more distinct from the actual spore than is typical, can sometimes form; this is perhaps due to poor weather.<ref name=p66/> The club-shaped [[basidia]] measure 25 to 40 by 9 to 14 \u03bcm, and each basidium bears four spores. The yellowish pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the face of the gill) are [[ventricose]] or occasionally club-shaped, measuring 41 to 89 by 12 to 23 \u03bcm, including a [[cell wall]] up to 4.5 \u03bcm thick. The tip often bends and is encrusted with crystal-like structures, while the base tapers, or narrows into a small stalk.<ref name=p58/> The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gill) are much the same, but they are typically somewhat shorter and stouter.<ref>Vauras and Kokkonen 2009, pp. 58, 60.</ref> The longer caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) occur all the way down the stem and measure up to 99 \u03bcm in length with a more variable shape. The mushrooms also feature \"paracystidia\", club-shaped cystidia-like structures on the gills lacking crystals, as well as \"cauloparacystidia\" on the stem. In ''Inocybe saliceticola'', the paracystidia are fairly abundant, with thin cell-walls, while the abundant cauloparacystidia can have slightly thicker walls and are often arranged in clusters.<ref name=p60>Vauras and Kokkonen 2009, p. 60.</ref>\n\n===Similar species===\nOf the species of ''Marginatae'' associated with willow, five (''I.&nbsp;salicis-herbaceae'', ''I.&nbsp;substellata'', ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'', ''I.&nbsp;salicis'' and ''I.&nbsp;mixtilis'') can be readily distinguished from ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'' as their spores feature distinct, strongly protruding excrescences. In addition, they are found in vastly different habitats: ''I.&nbsp;mixtilis'' and ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'' favour willow only in [[montane]] habitats, while ''I.&nbsp;salicis-herbaceae'' and ''I.&nbsp;substellata'' grow exclusively in montane habitats. ''I.&nbsp;salicis'' is rare in Nordic countries, and is typically collected from [[dunes]]. Of the other two listed by Vauras and Kokkonen, the spores of ''I.&nbsp;dunensis'' are distinctly larger and of a different shape to those of ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'', and the cystidia are shorter. While the species is typically found on the beach, it grows on fine sand, and has not been recorded in Finland. ''I.&nbsp;obtusiuscula'' also has larger spores of a different shape, and they are a darker colour, owing to their thick cell walls. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Phylogenetic analysis]] of the respective [[internal transcribed spacer]] sequences has confirmed that ''I.&nbsp;obtusiuscula'' and ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'' are separate species.<ref name=\"p66\"/>\n\n''[[Inocybe alnea]]'' and ''[[Inocybe ochracea|I.&nbsp;ochracea]]'', regarded by some as the same species, can also be distinguished from ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'' by the presence of protruding nodules on the spores. DNA analysis confirmed that they were separate from ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'', and, in any case, it is possible that they do not grow in association with willow. ''[[Inocybe hirculus|I.&nbsp;hirculus]]'' has been recorded growing near ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'', but can be differentiated both macroscopically and microscopically; the mushrooms of ''I.&nbsp;hirculus'' have a much more [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] cap, and the stem does not join a bulb, while the spores are larger. Macroscopically, ''[[Inocybe rivularis|I.&nbsp;rivularis]]'', which could grow in similar habitats to that of ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'', produces larger mushrooms and has powder only towards the top of the stem. It also differs microscopically.<ref name=p66/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Finland and Sweden.svg|thumb|right|upright|''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'' has been recorded in Finland and Sweden.]]\n''Inocybe saliceticola'' grows in a [[mycorrhizal]] association with willow (''Salix''). Precise favoured species are unclear; at least one of the [[Salix phylicifolia|tea-leaved willow]] (''Salix phylicifolia'') or the [[Salix myrsinifolia|dark-leaved willow]] (''S.&nbsp;myrsinifolia'') is a possible symbiont, while other trees that the species has been found near include the [[Salix pentandra|bay willow]] (''S.&nbsp;pentandra''), the [[Salix cinnerea|grey willow]] (''S.&nbsp;cinnerea''), the [[Alnus incana|grey alder]] (''Alnus incana'') and species of [[birch]] (''Betula''). ''I.&nbsp;saliceticola'' is found most typically in moist thickets or woodland close to shores, but recordings have also been made in other moist habitats. Mushrooms are encountered on the ground, growing from [[detritus]] or amongst moss, such as the [[Calliergon cordifolium|heart-leaved spear-moss]] (''Calliergon cordifolium''), the [[Sphagnum squarrosum|spiky-bog moss]] (''Sphagnum squarrosum'') and species of ''[[Mnium]]''. They are typically near plants such as the [[Lysimachia thyrsiflora|tufted loosestrife]] (''Lysimachia thyrsiflora''), the [[Ranunculus repens|creeping buttercup]] (''Ranunculus repens''), the [[Galium palustre|common marsh-bedstraw]] (''Galium palustre''), the [[Comarum palustre|purple marshlocks]] (''Comarum palustre'') and the [[Calamagrostis canescens|purple small-reed]] (''Calamagrostis canescens''), and share the habitat with other ''Inocybe'', including ''[[Inocybe acuta|I.&nbsp;acuta]]'' and [[Inocybe lacera var. helobia|''I.&nbsp;lacera''&nbsp;var.&nbsp;''helobia'']].<ref name=p60/>\n\n''Inocybe saliceticola'' has been recorded in several locations around Finland, ranging from the [[hemiboreal]] zones in the east and the south of the country, to [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] areas in the north, and it has also been found in Sweden, close to the [[Klar\u00e4lven]].<ref>Vauras and Kokkonen 2009, pp. 60, 62.</ref> At least in [[North Karelia]], Finland, it is relatively common in the right habitats.<ref name=p60/> It is one of over 150 species of ''Inocybe'' found in the [[Nordic countries]],<ref name=p57/> and fruit bodies can be encountered between late July and early October.<ref name=p60/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Inocybe species|List of ''Inocybe'' species]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite journal |author= Kobayashi, Takahito |author2= Courtecuisse, R\u00e9gis |year= 2000|title= Two new species of ''Inocybe'', section ''Marginatae'' (Agaricales, Cortinariaceae) from Japan|journal= Mycoscience|volume= 41|issue=2|pages= 161\u20136|doi= 10.1007/BF02464326}}\n*{{cite journal |author1=Matheny, P.

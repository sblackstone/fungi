It is one of the most readily recognized of all the [[edible mushroom]]s and highly sought after. Each [[Ascocarp|fruit body]] begins as a tightly compressed, grayish sponge with lighter ridges, and expands to form a large yellowish sponge with large pits and ridges raised on a large white [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The pitted yellow-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] measure {{convert|2|\u2013|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad by {{convert|2|\u2013|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall, and are fused to the stem at its lower margin, forming a continuous hollow. The pits are rounded and irregularly arranged. The hollow stem is typically {{convert|2|\u2013|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2|\u2013|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and white to yellow. The fungus fruits under [[hardwood]]s during a short period in the spring, depending on the weather, but it is also associated with old orchards, woods, disturbed grounds and burnt areas. Although a process was reported in 1982 to grow the fruit bodies under controlled conditions, attempts to cultivate the mushroom commercially have only been partially successful.\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe fungus was originally named ''Phallus esculentus'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753),<ref name=Fries1753/> and given its current name by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1801.<ref name=Persoon1801/><ref name=\"url Kuo\"/>\n\n''Morchella esculenta'' is [[common name|commonly]] known by various names: morel, common morel, true morel, morel mushroom, yellow morel, sponge morel,<ref name=Hanelt2001/> Molly Moocher, haystack, and dryland fish.<ref name=Roody2003/> In [[Nepal]] it is known as ''Guchi chyau''.<ref name=NRMP2000/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''esculenta'', meaning \"edible\".\n\nThe scientific name ''Morchella esculenta'' has been applied to many similar yellow morels throughout the world.  In 2014 Richard et al. used DNA analysis to restrict the ''M. esculenta'' name to a single species of yellow morel commonly found in Europe and also reported from China.<ref name=Richard2014/>  Other species of yellow morel, including those in North America, have received new scientific names.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is pale brownish cream, yellow to tan or pale brown to grayish brown. The edges of the ridges are usually not darker than the pits, and somewhat oval in outline, sometimes bluntly cone-shaped with a rounded top or more elongate. Caps are hollow, and attached to the stem at the lower edge, and typically about {{convert|2|\u2013|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad by {{convert|2|\u2013|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is brittle. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is white to pallid or pale yellow, hollow, and straight or with a club-shaped or bulbous base. It is finely granular overall, somewhat ridged, generally about {{convert|2|\u2013|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2|\u2013|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Ammirati1987/> In age it may have brownish stains near the base.<ref name=Roody2003/> It has a passing resemblance to the common stinkhorn (''[[Phallus impudicus#Description|Phallus impudicus]]''), for which it is sometimes mistaken.<ref>{{cite book |author=Arora, David |authorlink=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |pages=768\u201369 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3rVpkZII8IC&pg=RA1-PA768}}</ref> Yellow morels are often found near wooded areas. Giant centipedes make their home inside these morels, so you can identify the morel if you see a centipede inside. Infested morels usually have a hole in the top.\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s range from white to cream to slightly yellow in deposit, although a [[spore print]] may be difficult to obtain given the shape of the fruit body.<ref name=Hall2003/> The spores are formed in [[ascus|asci]] lining the pits\u2014the ridges are sterile.<ref name=\"Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991\"/> They are ellipsoidal, smooth, thin-walled, translucent ([[hyaline]]), and measure 17.5\u201321.9 by 8.8\u201311.0&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The [[ascus|asci]] are eight-spored, 223\u2013300 by 19\u201320&nbsp;\u00b5m, cylindrical, and hyaline. The [[paraphyses]] are filamentous, cylindrical, 5.8\u20138.8&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and hyaline.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>\n\nThe [[hypha]]e of the stem are interwoven, hyaline, and measure 5.8\u20139.4&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The surface hyphae are inflated, spherical to pear-shaped, 22\u201344&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, covered by a network of interwoven hyphae 11\u201316.8&nbsp;\u00b5m wide with recurved cylindrical hyphal ends.\n\n===Development===\nFruit bodies have successfully been grown in the laboratory. R. Ower was the first to describe the developmental stages of ascomata grown in a controlled chamber.<ref name=Ower1982/> This was followed by in-depth cytological studies by Thomas Volk and Leonard (1989, 1990). To study the morel life cycle they followed the development of ascoma fruiting in association with tuberous begonias (''[[Begonia tuberhybrida]]''), from very small primordia to fully developed fruit bodies.<ref name=Volk1989/><ref name=Volk1990/>\n\nYoung fruit bodies begin development in the form of a dense knot of hyphae, when suitable conditions of moisture and nutrient availability conditions have been reached. Hyphal knots are underground and cup-shaped for some time, but later emerge from the soil and develop into a stalked fruiting body. Further growth makes the [[hymenium]] convex with the [[ascus|asci]] facing towards the outer side. Because of the unequal growth of the surface of the hymenium, it becomes folded to form many ridges and depressions, resulting in the sponge or honeycomb appearance.<ref name=Sharma1988/>\n\n==Similar species==\n''Morchella esculenta'' is probably the most popular of the morels. In contrast to ''[[Morchella angusticeps|M.&nbsp;angusticeps]]'' and its relatives, the caps are light-colored throughout development, especially the ridges, which remain paler than the pits. ''[[Morchella crassipes|M.&nbsp;crassipes]]'' is sometimes confused with ''M.&nbsp;esculenta''. According to Smith (1975), the two are distinct, but young forms of ''M.&nbsp;crassipes'' are difficult to separate from ''M.&nbsp;esculenta''. The two are similar in color, but ''M.&nbsp;crassipes'' is larger, often has thin ridges, and sometimes has a stem base that is enlarged and longitudinally grooved.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>\n\nMorels have also been confused with stinkhorns,<ref name=Arora1986/> but specimens of the latter have a [[volva (mycology)|volva]] at the base of the stem, are covered with [[gleba]]\u2014a slimy, foul-smelling spore mass.\n\nSee also Gyromitra esculenta, which is similar in appearance and poisonous.\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n[[File:Speisemorchel-1.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing by von Albin Schmalfu\u00df, 1897]]\nFruit bodies are sometimes found solitary, but more often in groups, on the ground in a variety of habitats. A preference for soil with a [[limestone]] base (alkaline) has been noted,<ref name=Roody2003/> but they have also been found in [[soil pH|acid soils]].<ref name=Metzler1992/>\nThe mushroom is usually found in early spring, in forests, orchards, yards, gardens and sometimes in recently burned areas.<ref name=Ammirati1987/> In North America, it is sometimes referred to as the \"May mushroom\" due to its consistent fruiting in that month, but the time of fruiting varies locally, from February to July. It is typically the last morel species to fruit in locales where more than one species are found.<ref name=McKnight1987/> For example, in northern Canada and in cooler mountainous regions, morels typically do not appear until June.<ref name=Bessette1992/> It has been suggested that the springtime fruiting may be due to their ability to grow at low temperatures to the exclusion of competition,<ref name=Baker1979/> a conclusion later corroborated by experiments correlating spore [[germination]] to soil temperatures.<ref name=Schmidt1983/>\n\nOne author suggests the acronym PETSBASH may be used to remember the trees associated with morels: [[pine]], [[elm]], [[Liriodendron|tulip]], [[sassafras]], [[beech]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[sycamore]], and [[hickory]].<ref name=Rosen1982/>\n\nIn North America, it is widely distributed, but especially common in eastern North America and the Midwest. [[David Arora]] notes that \"large crops can also be found around the bases of dying (but not quite dead) elms attacked by Dutch elm disease.\"<ref name=Arora1986/> The species has been named state mushroom of [[Minnesota]], and was the first state mushroom of any state.<ref name=\"Minnesota\">{{cite web |url= http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/symbols.aspx#mushroom|title= Minnesota State Symbols: Minnesota State Mushroom|publisher= [[Minnesota Legislature]]|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=1.149|title= 2010 Minnesota Statutes: 1.149 State Mushroom|publisher= Minnesota Office of the Revisor of Statutes|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIt can also be found in Brazil and Bulgaria.<ref name=Cortez2004/>\nIn [[Jammu and Kashmir]] wild mushrooms, locally known as Himalayan wild mushroom, Gucchi, [[Morchella conica]] and ''Morchella esculenta'', are gathered and supplied as [[medical remedy]].<ref>[http://jkmpic.blogspot.com/2015/03/wild-mushrooms-for-sale.html JK Medicinal Plants Introduction Centre]</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\nDue to the mushroom's prized fruit bodies, several attempts have been made to grow the fungus in culture. In 1901, Repin reported successfully obtaining fruit bodies in a cave in which cultures had been established in flower pots nine years previously in 1892.<ref name=Repin1901/>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Edibility===\n[[File:Morille.JPG|thumb|right|Harvested morels]]\n''Morchella esculenta'', like all morels, are among the most highly prized of all [[edible mushroom]]s. Raw mushrooms have a gastrointestinal irritant, [[hydrazine]], but [[parboil]]ing or [[Blanching (cooking)|blanching]] before consumption will remove it. Old fruit bodies that show signs of decay may be poisonous.<ref name=Hall2003/> The mushrooms may be fried in butter or baked after being stuffed with meats and vegetables.<ref name=Abel1993/> The mushrooms may also be dried by threading the caps onto string and hanging them in the sun; this process is said to concentrate the flavor.<ref name=Hall2003/> One study determined the main nutritional components to be as follows (on a [[Dry matter|dry weight]] basis): [[dietary protein|protein]] 32.7%, [[fat]] 2.0%, [[dietary fiber|fiber]] 17.6%, [[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]] 9.7%, and [[carbohydrate]]s 38.0%.<ref name=Wahid1988/>\n\nIn one isolated case in Germany, six people were reported to have developed [[neurologic]] effects between 6\u201312 hours after consumption. The effects included [[ataxia]] and visual disturbances, and lasted up to a day before disappearing without enduring effects.<ref name=Pfab2008/>\n\n===Bioactive compounds===\nBoth the fruit bodies and the mycelia of ''M.&nbsp;esculenta'' contain an uncommon [[amino acid]], ''cis''-3-amino-<small>L</small>-proline; this amino acid does not appear to be protein bound.<ref name=Hatanaka1969/> In addition to ''M.&nbsp;esculenta'', the amino acid is known to exist only in ''[[Morchella conica|M.&nbsp;conica]]'' and ''[[Morchella crassipes|M.&nbsp;crassipes]].''<ref name=Moriguchi1979/>\n\n==Industrial applications; solid state-fermentation==\n[[Solid-state fermentation]] is an industrial process to produce [[enzyme]]s and to upgrade the values of existing foods, especially oriental foods. Solid-state fermentation is a process whereby an insoluble substrate is fermented with sufficient moisture but without free water. Solid-state fermentation, unlike that of slurry state, requires no complex fermentation controls and has many advantages over submerged liquid fermentation. ''M.&nbsp;esculenta'' has shown promise in degrading [[starch]] and upgrading the nutritional value of cornmeal during solid-state fermentation.<ref name=Zhang2009/>\n\n''M.&nbsp;esculenta'' mycelia is able to bind to and inhibit the effects of [[furanocoumarin]]s, chemicals found in [[grapefruit]] that inhibit human [[cytochrome p450]] enzymes and are responsible for the [[List of drugs affected by grapefruit|\"grapefruit/drug\" interaction phenomenon]].<ref name=Myung2008/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nCommon Morel - Morchella esculenta (26031278013).jpg\nMorchella esculenta 5.jpg\nMorchella esculenta 6.jpg\nOld holiday shot of Morchella esculenta (GB= Morel mushroom, D= Speise-Morchel, NL= Gewone morielje) - panoramio.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=Richard2014>{{cite journal| title=True morels (''Morchella'', Pezizales) of Europe and North America: evolutionary relationships inferred from multilocus data and a unified taxonomy| first= Franck| last=Richard| first2=Jean-Michel| last2=Bellanger| first3=Philippe | last3=Clowez| first4=Regis| last4=Courtecuisse| first5=Karen| last5=Hansen| first6=Kerry| last6=O'Donnell| first7=Mathieu| last7=Sauve| first8=Alexander| last8=Urban| first9=Pierre-Arthur| last9=Moreau| journal=Mycologia| date=30 December 2014| id=14-166| url=http://www.mycologia.org/content/early/2014/12/24/14-166.abstract| type=Preliminary version published online| doi=10.3852/14-166| pmid=25550303| volume=107| pages=359\u2013382}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Abel1993>{{cite book |vauthors=Abel D, Horn B, Kay R |title=A Guide to Kansas Mushrooms |publisher=University Press of Kansas |location=Lawrence |year=1993 |page=63 |isbn=0-7006-0571-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ammirati1985>{{cite book |title=Poisonous Mushrooms of Canada|vauthors=Ammirati J, Traquair JA, Horgen PA |year=1985|publisher=Fitzhenry & Whiteside in cooperation with Agriculture Canada|isbn=978-0-88902-977-4 |pages=287\u201388}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Ammirati1987>{{cite book |vauthors=Ammirati JF, McKenny M, Stuntz DE |title=The New Savory Wild Mushroom |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |year=1987 |pages=209\u201310 |isbn=0-295-96480-4}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: a Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |pages=787\u201388 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86tM01VsFG0C&lpg=RA1-PA787&dq=morchella%20esculenta&pg=RA1-PA788#v=onepage&q=morchella%20esculenta&f=false |accessdate=2010-03-22}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Baker1979>{{cite book |title=Biological control of plant pathogens |vauthors=Baker KF, Cook RJ |year=1974 |publisher=W.

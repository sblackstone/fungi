Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790, it was also known as ''Tricholoma nudum'' for many years. It is found in both [[coniferous]] and [[deciduous]] woodlands. It is a fairly distinctive mushroom that is widely eaten, though there is some caution about edibility. Nevertheless, it has been cultivated in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]].\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] described the wood blewit in his work ''Herbier de la France'' in 1790 as ''Agaricus nudus'', reporting that it was common in the woods all year. He wrote of two varieties: one whose gills and cap are initially light violet and mature to burgundy, while the other has vine-coloured gills that intensify in colour with age. He added that the first variety was often confused with ''[[Cortinarius violaceus]]'', though it has a \"nude\" cap and no spidery web veil unlike the other species.<ref name=Bulliard1790/>  English naturalist [[James Bolton]] gave it the name ''Agaricus bulbosa''\u2014the bulbous agaric\u2014in his ''An History of Fungusses growing about Halifax'' in 1791. He noted that it was rare in the region, though had found some in [[Ovenden]].<ref name=bolton1791/>\n\nGerman mycologist [[Paul Kummer]] placed it in the genus ''Tricholoma'' in 1871,<ref name=Kummer1871/> the same year that English botanist [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]] placed it in ''Lepista''.<ref name=Cooke1871/> It was known by these names for many years, with some authors accepting ''Lepista'' and while others retained the wood blewit in ''Tricholoma''. In 1969 [[Howard E. Bigelow]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]] reviewed ''Lepista'' and reclassified it as a [[subgenus]] of ''Clitocybe''<ref name=bigelow1969/> Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja has called for the sinking of ''Lepista'' into ''Clitocybe'', with ''C. nebularis'' as the type species of the latter genus.<ref name=\"harmaja\">Harmaja, H. (2003). Notes on ''Clitocybe s. lato'' (Agaricales). Ann. Bot. Fennici 40: 213-218.</ref> Hence the wood blewit is classified as either ''Lepista nuda'' or ''Clitocybe nuda''.<ref name=\"Alvaradoetal2015\"/>\n\nA 2015 genetic study found that the genera ''Collybia'' and ''Lepista'' were closely related to the core clade of ''Clitocybe'', but that all three were polyphyletic, with many members in lineages removed from other members of the same genus and instead more closely related to the other two. To complicate matters, the wood blewit is not closely related to the type species of ''Lepista'', ''L. densifolia''. Alvarado and colleagues declined to define the genera but proposed several options and highlighted the need for a wider analysis.<ref name=\"Alvaradoetal2015\"/>\n\nThe species is commonly known as the wood blewit. Cooke called it the amethyst lepista,<ref name=Cooke1871/> [[John Sibthorp]] called it the blue-gilled agaric in his 1794 work ''Flora Oxoniensis'',<ref name=sibthorp1794/>\n\n==Description==\nThis mushroom can range from lilac to purple-pink. Some North American specimens are duller and tend toward tan, but usually have purplish tones on the stem and gills. The gills are attached to the short, stout stem. Mature specimens have a darker color and flatter cap; younger ones are lighter with more convex caps. Wood blewits have a very distinctive odor, which has been likened by one author to that of frozen orange juice.<ref name=\"arora\"/>\n\nWood blewits can be confused with certain purple species of the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'', including the uncommon ''[[Cortinarius camphoratus|C. camphoratus]]'',<ref name = \"JordanFG\"/> many of which may be poisonous. ''Cortinarius'' mushrooms often have the remains of a veil under their caps and a ring-like impression on their stem. Wood blewits can be easily distinguished by their odor, as well as by their [[spore print]].  Wood blewits have a light (white to pale pink) spore print; ''[[Cortinarius]]'' species produce a rusty brown spore print after several hours on white paper. Their brown spores often dust their stems and objects beneath them.<ref name = \"illinois\">{{cite book |author1=McFarland, Joe |author2=Mueller, Gregory M | year = 2009 | title = Edible Wild Mushrooms of Illinois & Surrounding States: A Field-To-Kitchen Guide | publisher = University of Illinois Press | isbn = 978-0-252-07643-5|pages=57\u201358|url=https://books.google.com/?id=79oteRx6Bh4C&pg=PA57&dq=%22wood+blewit%22#v=onepage&q=%22wood%20blewit%22&f=false}}</ref><!-- cites para -->\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe wood blewit is found in Europe and North America and is becoming more common in Australia, where it appears to have been introduced. In Australia it has developed a relationship with some eucalyptus species and gorse; with an entirely different growth pattern and differs slightly in appearance to its European Lepista Nuda cousins. It is referred to as 'The Purple Nudist mushroom' a common name coined by Austalian Free Food Forager Ingrid Button in 2016.\nIt is a [[saprotrophic]] species, growing on decaying leaf litter. In the United Kingdom, it appears from September through to December.\n\nSoil analysis of soil containing mycelium from a wood blewit [[fairy ring]] under Norway spruce (''[[Picea abies]]'') and Scots pine (''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'') in southeast Sweden yielded fourteen halogenated low molecular weight organic compounds, three of which were brominated and the others chlorinated. It is unclear whether these were metabolites or pollutants. Brominated compounds are unknown as metabolites from terrestrial fungi.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Analysis of halogenated organic compounds in coniferous forest soil from a Lepista nuda (wood blewitt) fairy ring | journal=Chemosphere |issn=0045-6535|author= Hjelm, Olof |year=1996 |volume=32| issue=9 |pages=1719\u201328 |doi=10.1016/0045-6535(96)00089-6| bibcode=1996Chmsp..32.1719H }}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nIn Australia, male [[satin bowerbird]]s collect blue objects to decorate their bowers with.

This is particularly likely if the mushroom is consumed raw, though allergic reactions are known even from cooked blewits. It is therefore important to cook wood blewits before eating, as consumption of raw specimens could lead to [[indigestion]]. Wood blewits contain the sugar [[trehalose]], which is edible for most people.\n\nBlewits can be eaten as a cream sauce or [[Saut\u00e9ing|saut\u00e9ed]] in [[butter]]. They can also be cooked like [[tripe]] or as [[omelette]] filling, and also make good [[stew]]ing mushrooms.<ref name = \"Mabey01\"/> They have a strong flavour, so they combine well with leeks or onions.<ref name = \"JordanFG\"/>\n\nWood blewits can be preserved in olive oil or white vinegar after blanching.<ref name = \"JordanFG\"/>\n\nThe wood blewit  has been cultivated in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]].<ref name = \"Carluccio03\"/>{{page needed|date=January 2018}} Cultivated wood blewits are said not to taste as good as wild wood blewits.<ref name = \"JordanFG\"/>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Alvaradoetal2015\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarado P, Moreno G, Vizzini A, Consiglio G, Manj\u00f3n JL, Setti L |title=''Atractosporocybe'', ''Leucocybe'' and ''Rhizocybe'', three new clitocyboid genera in the Tricholomatoid clade (Agaricales) with notes on ''Clitocybe'' and ''Lepista'' |journal=Mycologia |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=123\u201336 |year=2015 |pmid=25344261 |doi=10.3852/13-369 |url=http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=25344261}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"arora\">{{cite book |author= Arora D |year= 1986 |title= Mushrooms Demystified |location= Berkeley, California |publisher= Ten Speed Press |isbn= 978-0-89815-169-5 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=bigelow1969>{{cite journal | title=The status of ''Lepista''\u2014a new section of ''Clitocybe'' |vauthors=Bigelow HE, Smith AH | journal= Brittonia | doi=10.2307/2805523 | year=1969 |volume = 21|issue = 2|pages= 144\u201377|jstor=2805523 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=bolton1791>{{cite book | author=Bolton J | year=1791 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MiMhAQAAMAAJ&pg=PT498 | title=An History of Fungusses growing about Halifax | page= 147 | volume=Appendix | publisher=Self-published}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Bulliard1790>{{cite book |title=Herbier de la France |author=Bulliard JPF |authorlink=Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard|year=1790 |publisher=Chez l'auteur, Didot, Debure, Belin |location=Paris |volume=8 |page=plate 439 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4303760 |language=French}}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Carluccio03\">{{cite book | author = [[Antonio Carluccio|Carluccio A]] | year = 2003 | title = The Complete Mushroom Book | publisher = Quadrille | isbn = 978-0-8478-2556-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Cooke1871>{{cite book |title=Handbook of British Fungi, with Full Descriptions of All the Species, and Illustrations of the Genera |author=Cooke MC. |year=1871 |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |location=London |page=192 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4292096}}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"JordanFG\">{{cite book | author = Jordan P | year = 2006 | title = Field Guide to Edible Mushrooms of Britain and Europe | publisher = New Holland Publishers | isbn = 978-1-84537-419-8|url=|pages=76\u201377, 150}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Kummer1871>{{cite book |title=Der F\u00fchrer in die Pilzkunde |edition=1 |author=Kummer P |authorlink=Paul Kummer |year=1871 |location=Zerbst, Germany |publisher=Luppe |page=132 |language=German |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/34209701}}</ref>\n\n<ref name = \"Mabey01\">{{cite book | author = [[Richard Mabey|Mabey R]] | year = 2004 | title = Food for Free | publisher = HarperCollins | isbn = 978-0-00-718303-6}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=sibthorp1794>{{cite book |title=Flora Oxoniensis, Exhibens Plantas in Agro Oxoniensi Sponte Crescentes | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0f1eAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA346 | author = Sibthorp J | year=1794 | page=346 | publisher=Fletcher, Hanwell & Cook | location=Oxford, United Kingdom}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Clitocybe nuda\">{{cite web |title=''Clitocybe nuda'' (Bull.)

It is adorned with conspicuous, woolly to felty, yellow warts; bald underneath the warts; the margin not lined, or only faintly lined at maturity.<ref name=MushroomExpert>{{cite web | url = http://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita_flavorubescens.html | title = ''Amanita flavorubens''|work=MushroomExpert.com |accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] is present as yellow to orange to bright orange-yellow flocculent to confluent warts, friable, sparsely and irregularly distributed, easily removable, pulverulent, splotchy brown around the center, yellow at the edge.The flesh is 3 \u2013 7&nbsp;mm thick over the stem, thinning evenly to the margin, white or yellowish, bright yellow just under the cap skin. The gills are free to very narrowly adnate, subcrowded to crowded, creamy ivory to cream to off-white, 3 \u2013 8&nbsp;mm broad, with a white pulverulent edge and also a small [[decurrent]] tooth.  The short gills are truncate to [[Truncate|subtruncate]] to [[attenuate|subattenuate]] to attenuate to attenuate in steps, unevenly distributed, of diverse lengths, and plentiful. The stem is 52-150 (5.2\u201315&nbsp;cm) \u00d7 7\u201314&nbsp;mm (0.7-1.4&nbsp;cm), usually narrowing upward, infrequently narrowing downward, flaring at the top, yellow to white or very pale yellowish white and pruinose to finely powdery above the ring, white to yellow or occasionally with scattered yellowish surface [[fibrils]] and fibrillose below the ring, sometimes silky longitudinally striate.  The [[bulb]] is 15 - 25 \u00d7 15 \u2013 21&nbsp;mm, more or less turnip-shaped, with light red-pinkish stains; interior of the bulb is often the place where wine-red staining first appears intensely.  The ring is membranous, superior, skirt-like, flaring then collapsing, pale yellowish white to cream to white, slightly more yellow underneath, with a thickened edge.  The volva is absent or present as rings of yellow-brown warts on the bulb or brilliant yellow loose patches appressed to the stem and are large, friable, detersile, sometimes lost during collecting.  The flesh is white or slightly pink, hollow or partially hollowed in the middle to stuffed. The spores measure  7.8-11.0  (0.78-1.1&nbsp;mm) \u00d7 5.4-7.0 (0.54-0.70&nbsp;mm) \u00b5m and are [[ellipsoid]] to [[elongation (geometry)|elongate]] (infrequently broadly [[ellipsoid]]) and [[amyloid]].  Clamps are not present at bases of basidia.<ref name=Amanitaceae>{{cite web | url = http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+flavorubens | title = ''Amanita flavorubens''|work=Amanitaceae.org |accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref>\n\n[[Rain]] will quickly wash [[pigment]] away from the yellow-orange [[Pileus (mycology)|pileus]].  Bruising is sometimes reported only from the stem base for this species, but it commonly bruises throughout the fruiting body.  Occasionally, especially in areas with dense root mats, specimens will be found in which the entire pileus is wine-colored from bruising during expansion through the root mat. A researcher has found one specimen with the cap intensely bruised before expansion.<ref name=\"Amanitaceae\"/>\nThe cap had a dark red brown color in the center and elsewhere ranged from brown to pale yellow brown at the cap margin. The cap warts were in concentric rings and somewhat [[Cocoloring|concolorous]] with the surrounding cap skin, but always with a distinct yellow tint.\nThe odor is of clean laundry.\n\n=== Habitat ===\n\n''A. flavorubens'' was originally described from the state of [[Ohio]], [[US (country)|USA]] and is also known from forests associated with [[beech]] ([[Fagus grandifolia]]), oak ([[Quercus]]), pine ([[Pinus]]), birch ([[Betula]]), and also the [[Canadian hemlock]] ([[Tsuga canadensis]]) from the southeastern part of [[Canada]] to the state of [[Alabama]] in eastern [[North America]], central [[Mexico]], and southeastern [[Arizona]].\n\nAmanita flavorubens is one of the few [[taxa]] in [[North America]] that are known to have a western population disjunct from an eastern primary area of distribution.<ref name=\"Amanitaceae\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Amanita]]''\n* [[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' Species]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{CCBYSASource|sourcepath=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+flavorubens|sourcearticle=Amanita flavorubens|revision=740502386|authors(s)=Rodham E.

The mushroom has orangish-yellow [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that reach up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and thick club-shaped [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first described by as ''Agaricus varius'' by [[Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer]] in 1774.<ref name=Schaeffer1774/> It was given its current name by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838.<ref name=Fries1838/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the \"contrary webcap\".<ref name=EnglishCommonNames/>\n\n==Description==\n[[image:Cortinarius varius 01.jpg|thumb|left|The cap has expanded and ripped most of the silky cortina of this specimen, revealing lilac gills that will later become brownish when the spores develop.]]\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, initially spherical to convex, then flattened or depressed, at first with thin, involute margin, bearing fragments of veil when young. The cap surface is sticky and smooth, orangish-yellow, with a light [[ochre]] tint, and yellower at the edge than in the middle, where the color is more rusty yellow. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded closely together, usually somewhat [[wikt:emarginate|emarginate]] (notched), thin and not very broad (5\u20138&nbsp;mm). They are initially a rich [[cornflower blue]], to [[lilac]] then finally ochre-cinnamon, with slightly scalloped edge.<ref name=Pilat1961/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is solid, thick in the lower part like a club. It is usually quite short when young, then often elongated, {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|0.6|\u2013|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} or more in the swollen part. Depending on the maturity of the mushroom, the surface of the stem can be covered with tufts of fine hairs that are pressed against the surface, to fibrillose to almost smooth. The stem color is white with a slight blue to lilac tinge at the top that later disappears, slightly yellowish-[[cream (color)|cream]] below, changing to completely pale yellowish-ochre when old. The cortina (a cobweb-like [[partial veil]] made of silky fibrils) is and white, but later becomes cinnamon when the mushroom drops its spores. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm, finely and compactly fleshy, white in the cap, later with a faint yellow tinge, undulatingly fibrillose in the stem and with a faint yellowish tinge. The odor is \"pleasant\", and the taste is also pleasant and mild. It has been described variously as inedible,<ref name=Jordan2004/> or [[edible mushroom|edible]], and has been used for [[pickling]].<ref name=Pilat1961/>\n\nThe [[spore]]s are light rusty-brown, [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to almond-shaped, measuring 10\u201315 by 6.5\u20137.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u03bcm]] with a distinct oblique [[wikt:apiculus|apiculus]].<ref name=Pilat1961/> The flesh will turns a chrome yellow color when [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemically tested]] with a dilute solution of [[potassium hydroxide]] or [[ammonia]].<ref name=Jordan2004/>\n\n''Cortinarius varius'' is closely related to ''Cortinarius variosimilis'', a species that occurs in North America, but which has a paler cap, paler gills, and shorter spores.<ref>Moser MM, Ammirati JF (1999) Studies on North American Cortinarii 5. New and interesting Phlegmacia from Wyoming and the Pacific Northwest. Mycotaxon 72:289\u2013322.</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe fruit bodies of ''Cortinarius varius'' grow in groups in [[coniferous forest]]s, also in glades and at the edge of woods, from the end of summer until late in the autumn, when the frosts set in. In some places it is a common species, in other quite rare. It prefers [[calcareous]] soils.<ref name=Pilat1961/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Cortinarius species|List of ''Cortinarius'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=EnglishCommonNames>{{cite web |url=http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/ENGLISH_NAMES.pdf |title=Recommended English Names for Fungi in the UK |format=PDF |publisher=[[British Mycological Society]] |access-date=2012-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716083053/http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/ENGLISH_NAMES.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Fries1838>{{cite book |title=Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici |author=Fries EM. |year=1838 |publisher= |location= |page=258 |url= |accessdate= |language=Latin}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Jordan2004>{{cite book |author=Jordan M. |title=The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |year=2004 |page=273 |isbn=0-7112-2378-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULhwByKCyEwC&lpg=PA273&dq=Cortinarius%20varius&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q=Cortinarius%20varius&f=false |accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Pilat1961>{{cite book |author=Pilat \u00c1, U\u0161\u00e1k O. |title=Mushrooms and other Fungi |year=1961 |publisher=Peter Nevill |location=London, UK |page=102 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Schaeffer1774>{{cite book |title=Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu Nascuntur Icones |volume=4 |author=Schaeffer JC. |year=1774 |publisher= |location= |language=Latin |page=20 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlSpecies Fungorum - Species synonymy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=144173 |title=''Cortinarius varius'' (Schaeff.)

It was first described by New Zealand mycologist [[Geoff Ridley]] in 1991. It occurs in [[New Zealand]] in large number. It has only a dark ring rather than a universal veil and white spores. It is found under [[leptospermum]] and [[Nothofagus]]. It grows on ground usually in late summer. Its height is 110&nbsp;mm and width is 100&nbsp;mm.<ref>Family: Pluteaceae (Amanita) and species http://www.hiddenforest.co.nz/fungi/family/pluteaceae/amanitAmanitahtm{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image\n   | align     = left\n   | width     = 100\n   | footer    = Closer view of the [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] (left) and spores (right) of ''Amanita nehuta''\n   | image1    = Amanita nehuta 45430.jpg\n   | alt1      = Gills of ''Amanita nehuta''\n   | image2    = Amanita nehuta 39820.jpg\n   | alt2      = Spores of ''Amanita nehuta''\n  }}\nThe physical description is as follows:<ref name=Tulloss1>{{cite web|last=Tulloss R. E.|title=Amanita nehuta|url=http://www.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/nehutAmanitahtml}}</ref>\nThe cap is 25\u201365&nbsp;mm wide, plano-convex to plano-depressed, buff, non-viscid, with a striate margin. The volval remnants are pulverulent on the center raised into wart-like peaksor warts or radial ridges, colored pale sepiAmanita. Gills are crowded and free, measure 6\u20137 millimeters wide, and appear white to pale buff. The short gills are subtruncate. Its stem, or stipe, is 20\u201375 \u00d7 4\u201311 millimeters, [[hollow (mycology)|hollow]], exannulate, with a smooth to subfloccose upper stem and smooth lower stem. The surface is white, pale buff, or very pale grayish sepia in color like the cap. The basal bulb is clavate to bulbous, 10\u201316&nbsp;mm in diameter. The base has a rim or band of powdery volva, the same color as on the cap. The stem has no ring.\n\nThe spores measure 6.5\u20139 \u00d7 5.5\u20138 (-8.5) \u00b5m and are subglobose to broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid and inamyloid. They are white in color. Clamps are absent at the bases of the [[basidia]]. The flesh is white, with a very pale area under the skin in the center.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n\nThis species was originally described from [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], associated with many types of ''[[Nothofagus]]'', ''[[Leptospermum]]'', and ''[[Kunzea]]''. It is also known from the South island of New Zealand.<ref name=\"Tulloss1\"/>\n\n==Similar species==\n''Amanita nehuta'' is said to be similar to ''[[Amanita farinosa]]'', ''[[Amanita obsita]]'', ''[[Amanita subvaginata]]'' and ''[[Amanita xerocybe]]''. All these species appear to have a cap surface that gelatinizes late in development so that the volva remains intimately connected to the cap skin well into maturity of the fruiting body. For this reason, the cap often remains powdery looking well into maturity.<ref name=\"Tulloss1\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Amanita species|List of ''Amanita'' species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IndexFungorum|355193}}\n{{Amanitas}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q4739878}}\n\n[[Category:Amanita|nehuta]]\n[[Category:Fungi of New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1991]]"}]}}}}

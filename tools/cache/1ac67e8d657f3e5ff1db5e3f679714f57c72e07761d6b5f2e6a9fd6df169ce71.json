The small mushroom is characterized by its grooved, grayish-brown to violet-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|11|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and the slender grayish-brown to reddish-brown [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] covered with minute, fine, soft hairs. The mushroom produces [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] spores (spores that stain when treated with [[Melzer's reagent]]). Microscopic distinguishing features include the smooth, spindle-shaped cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge and face, respectively) and the [[diverticulum|diverticulate]] elements in the outer layer of the cap and the stem.\n\n==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==\n''Mycena lanuginosa'' was first collected by Haruki Takahashi in 2000, and published as a new species in 2007, along with seven other Japanese ''Mycena'' species. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''lanuginosa'', meaning \"lanugineous\", referring to the hairy stem. The Japanese name for the mushroom is ''Keashi-haiirotake'' (\u30b1\u30a2\u30b7\u30cf\u30a4\u30a4\u30ed\u30bf\u30b1).<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\nThe fungus is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Fragilipedes'' (Fr.) Qu\u00e9l., as defined by Dutch ''Mycena'' specialist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus|Maas Geesteranus]].<ref name=MaasGeesteranus1980/> This section is the largest in the genus ''Mycena''.<ref name=\"urlA key to Norwegian Mycenas\"/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|7|to|11|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, conical to convex to bell-shaped, and has distinct radial grooves that extend almost to the center. It is dry, and somewhat [[hygrophanous]] (changing color as it loses or absorbs water). The surface is initially [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (covered with what appears to be a fine white powder), but soon becomes smooth. The cap is dark brown at the center, and gradually changes to reddish-brown and finally to nearly white at the margin. The white [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to 0.5&nbsp;mm thick, and does not have any distinctive taste or odor. The slender [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|30|to|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.8|to|1.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, attached to the center of the cap, hollow, and dry. The top portion of the stem is pruinose, while near the base the surface is covered with soft, fine hairs. The stem color is grayish-brown to reddish-brown near the top, changing to reddish-brown near the bottom. The stem base is covered with long, fairly coarse, whitish fibrils. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are narrowly attached to the stem, distantly spaced (12\u201318 gills reach the stem), up to 1.5&nbsp;mm broad, thin, and whitish, with the gill edges the same color as the gill faces.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spores]] are roughly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, thin-walled, colorless, and measure 10\u201312 by 5.5\u20136.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are [[amyloid]], meaning they will [[staining|stain]] blue to black when treated with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are 35\u201342 by 7\u20139&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, four-spored, and have clamps at their bases.  The abundant cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are thin-walled, and measure 40\u201380 by 5\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m. The smooth, colorless, and thin-walled spindle-shaped cells sometimes come to an abruptly tapering point; they form a sterile gill edge. Like the cheilocystidia, the pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are also spindle-shaped, abundant, smooth and thin-walled; they measure 63\u2013102 by 8\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] tissue (tissue of the [[hymenium]]-bearing structure) is made of smooth, thin-walled element hyphae that are 3\u201325&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, roughly cylindrical (often inflated), [[hyaline]] (translucent), and dextrinoid (turning reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent). The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and cylindrical. They can be either smooth, or covered with scattered, warty or finger-like thin-walled brownish [[diverticulum|diverticulae]]. The underlying hyphae have a parallel arrangement, and are hyaline or brownish, dextrinoid, with short and inflated cells that are up to 35&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae measuring 3\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. These hyphae, as well as the terminal cells (caulocystidia), have characteristics similar to the hyphae of the cap cuticle. The flesh of the stem is composed of longitudinally arranged, cylindrical hyphae that are 6\u201320&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, smooth, hyaline, and [[dextrinoid]]. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the cortical layer of cap and stem, and at the basal septa of the basidia.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''M.&nbsp;lanuginosa'' closely resembles ''[[Mycena pilosella|M.&nbsp;pilosella]]'', a species originally described from Netherlands by Maas Geesteranus,<ref name=MaasGeesteranus1988/> and the European species ''[[Mycena zephirus|M.&nbsp;zephirus]]''; both are in the section ''Fragilipedes''. ''Mycena pilosella'' differs in several microscopic characteristics: it has densely diverticulate elements of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]]; long, cylindrical caulocystidia that diverge at a right angle; and it does not have pleurocystidia. ''Mycena zephirus'' is distinct in forming a whitish cap, a stem that is initially minutely hairly but later becomes smooth, radish-like odor, ellipsoid to cylindrical spores, and cheilocystidia with branches near the tip.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Mycena lanuginosa'' is known only from [[Kanagawa]], in [[Honshu]], Japan. Fruit bodies are found solitary or scattered, on dead leaves and twigs in lowland forests dominated by the [[oak]] species ''[[Quercus myrsinifolia]]'' and ''[[Quercus serrata|Q.&nbsp;serrata]]''. Fruiting occurs from March to November.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=Fungorum>{{cite web |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=532058 |title=''Mycena lanuginosa'' Har.

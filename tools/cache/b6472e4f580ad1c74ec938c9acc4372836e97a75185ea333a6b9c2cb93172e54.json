''spissa''''' is a variety of [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycete]] fungus of the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. This large, grey to brown-capped fungus has a very variable appearance but is commonly encountered in coniferous and deciduous forests in Europe and North America. It is sometimes referred to by the common name '''grey spotted Amanita'''.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is around 10&nbsp;cm in diameter when fully expanded, and is various shades of brown or brown/grey, sometimes washing off to buff. Younger specimens have grey veil remnants often in quite large; flat patches, but these are usually removed later by the weather. The mature [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is usually fairly long, and has a bulbous base which is without a discernible volva, having just several flaky ring zones instead. It is marked above the ring with vertical lines. The [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] is large and white, and also has lines. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded; white, and have a slight decurrent tooth. The '''flesh''' is white; smells of [[radish]], and turns purple when [[H2SO4]] is applied.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 978-0-330-44237-4}}</ref>\n\n===Similar species===\n*[[Amanita excelsa var. excelsa|''Amanita excelsa'' var. ''excelsa'']] is the less common, and more slender true form, which is said to lack the 'radish' odour.<ref name=Phillips06/>\n*''[[Amanita rubescens]]'' (The Blusher), which can be reduced to much the same colour by weather.\n*''[[Amanita pantherina]]'' (The Panther Cap), which is poisonous; has white veil remnants; a definite rim around the base of the stem, and looks like a brown ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' (Fly Agaric)\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Amanita excelsa'' var. ''spissa'' occurs in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]], and eastern [[North America]] in summer, and autumn. Growing with both broad leaved and coniferous trees.\n''A. excelsa'' var. ''spissa'' is considered by some authors to be the more common variety of ''[[Amanita excelsa]]''.<ref name=Phillips06/>\n\n==Edibility==\nPronounced edible by some,<ref>Mall Vaasmaa.

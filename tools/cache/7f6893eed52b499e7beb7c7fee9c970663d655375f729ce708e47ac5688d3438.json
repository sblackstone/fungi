''americana''''',  is a [[psilocybin mushroom]] in the family [[Hymenogastraceae]]. It is in the section Semilanceatae of ''[[Psilocybe]]'' and has [[psilocybin]] as its main active compound.\n\n==Description==\n*The '''cap''' is 1 \u2014 2.5&nbsp;cm [[wikt:convex|convex]] to nearly plane, and is sometimes broadly [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]] but not [[wikt:papillate|papillate]]. It is smooth, dull grayish brown to slightly [[wikt:olivacous|olivacous]], more reddish at the center, [[hygrophanous]], and becoming straw brown when dry with the center remaining more brownish. It sometimes has a bluish green tone, or olivacous tones at the margin when young.\n*The '''gills''' are [[adnexed]], [[subdistant]], broad, and dark chocolate brown to purplish brown with age.\n*The '''spores''' are dark purple brown, [[ellipsoid]], and 13 \u2014 14.5 by 7.5 \u2014 8.8(10)[[\u03bcm]].\n*The '''stipe''' is 1.4 \u2014 3.0&nbsp;cm by 1 \u2013 2&nbsp;mm, equal, enlarging at the base. It is whitish to very pale brownish, darker below, bruising blue, and finely fibrillose in the lower portion. The partial veil is thin and soon disappears.\n*The '''taste''' is weak to somewhat [[farinaceous]]; The '''odor''' is strongly aromatic to [[farinaceous]].\n*'''Microscopic features''': The [[basidium|basidia]] are 4-spored and [[pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] are absent. The [[cheilocystidia]] are 22 \u2014 33 by 5.5 \u2014 9 [[\u03bcm]], [[wikt:lageniform|lageniform]] and have an extended neck.\n\n==Habitat and formation==\n''Psilocybe liniformans'' var. ''americana'' is found scattered to [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] in rich pastures or grasslands, fruiting from summer to early winter. It has been collected in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[Michigan]], and has also been reported from [[Chile]] where it fruits in the spring.\nThis mushroom is very close to the type variety; the main difference is the lack of a gelatinous layer on the edge of the [[lamella (mycology)|lamella]]e and the [[wikt:terricolous|terricolous]] habitat.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Psilocybin mushrooms]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book | first=Paul | last=Stamets | year=1996 | title=Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World | publisher=Ten Speed Press | location=Berkeley | isbn=0-9610798-0-0}}\n\n{{Hallucinogenic mushrooms}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q76801}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Psilocybe liniformans var. americana}}\n[[Category:Entheogens]]\n[[Category:Psychoactive fungi]]\n[[Category:Psilocybe|liniformans var. americana]]\n[[Category:Psychedelic tryptamine carriers]]\n[[Category:Fungi of North America]]"}]}}}}

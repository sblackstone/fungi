The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of the [[saprobe]] typically grow in clusters on or near rotting [[hardwood]] tree stumps or underground tree roots. Depending on their stage of development, the [[tawny (color)|tawny]]-brown mushroom [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] may range in shape from oval to bell-shaped to convex, and reach diameters up to {{convert|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The caps, marked with fine radial or linear grooves that extend nearly to the center, rest atop whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long. In young specimens, the entire cap surface is coated with a fine layer of reflective [[mica]]-like cells that provide the inspiration for both the mushroom's [[specific name (botany)|species name]] and the [[common name]]s '''mica cap''', '''shiny cap''', and '''glistening inky cap'''. Although small and with thin [[trama (mycology)|flesh]], the mushrooms are usually bountiful, as they typically grow in dense clusters. A few hours after collection, the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] will begin to slowly dissolve into a black, inky, [[spore]]-laden liquid\u2014an [[enzyme|enzymatic]] process called ''autodigestion'' or ''deliquescence''. The fruit bodies are [[edible mushroom|edible]] before the gills blacken and dissolve, and cooking will stop the autodigestion process.\n\nThe microscopic characteristics and [[cytogenetics]] of ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' are well known, and it has been used frequently as a [[model organism]] to study [[cell division]] and [[meiosis]] in [[Basidiomycetes]]. [[Chemical analysis]] of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of [[antibacterial]] and [[enzyme]]-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as ''Coprinus micaceus'', the species was transferred to ''[[Coprinellus]]'' in 2001 as [[phylogenetic]] analyses provided the impetus for a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus ''[[Coprinus]]''. Based on external appearance, ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' is virtually indistinguishable from ''[[Coprinellus truncorum|C.&nbsp;truncorum]]'', and it has been suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.\n\n== History and taxonomy ==\n[[image:Agaricus micaceus Bulliard.png|thumb|left|''Agaricus micaceus'', illustrated by Bulliard in 1786|alt=Illustration of several light brown mushrooms of various sizes.]]\n''Coprinellus micaeus'' was illustrated in a [[woodcut]] by the 16th-century botanist [[Carolus Clusius]] in what is arguably the first published [[monograph]] on fungi, the 1601 ''Rariorum plantarum historia'' (History of rare plants), in an appendix, ''Fungorum in Pannoniis observatorum brevis historia'' (Brief history of fungi observed in Pannonia [Hungary]), genus XVI, p. cclxxxii.<ref name=\"Buller p.331\"/> Clusius erroneously believed the species to be poisonous, and classified it as a genus of ''Fungi perniciales'' (harmful fungi). The species was first described scientifically by French botanist [[Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Pierre Bulliard]] in 1786 as ''Agaricus micaceus'' in his work ''Herbier de la France''.<ref name=Bulliard1786/> In 1801, [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] grouped together all of the gilled fungi that auto-digested (''deliquesced'') during spore discharge into the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Coprinus'' of the genus ''Agaricus''.<ref name=Persoon1801/> [[Elias Magnus Fries]] later raised Persoon's section ''Coprinus'' to genus rank in his ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici'', and the species became known as ''Coprinus micaceus''.<ref name=Fries1838/> It was the [[type species]] of subsection ''Exannulati'' in [[section (biology)|section]] ''Micacei'' of the genus ''Coprinus'', a grouping of related [[taxon|taxa]] with [[partial veil|veils]] made of sphaerocysts (round swollen cells usually formed in clusters) exclusively or with thin-filamentous connective [[hypha]]e intermixed.<ref name=Singer1986/>  [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] studies published in the 1990s<ref name=Hopple1994/><ref name=Park1999/> demonstrated that many of the [[coprinoid fungi|coprinoid]] (''Coprinus''-like) mushrooms were in fact unrelated to each other. This culminated in a 2001 revision of the genus ''[[Coprinus]]'', which was split into four genera; ''C.&nbsp;micaeus'' was transferred to ''[[Coprinellus]]''.<ref name=\"Red01\"/>\n\nDue partly to their ready availability and the ease with which they may be grown in the laboratory, ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in [[cell biology|cytological]] studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link]] reported his observations of the structure of the [[hymenium]] (the fertile [[spore]]-bearing surface) in 1809,<ref name=Link1809/> but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as [[basidia]] were ''thecae'', comparable in form to the [[ascus|asci]] of the [[Ascomycetes]], and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' were copied in subsequent [[mycology|mycological]] publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 [[Joseph-Henri L\u00e9veill\u00e9]] and [[August Karl Joseph Corda|August Corda]] independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium.<ref name=\"Buller p.331\">Buller, 1924, p. 331.</ref> In 1924, [[A.

When expanded, the cap diameter reaches {{convert|8|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} with the margin torn into rays and turned upwards slightly. The color is yellow-brown or tan often with a darker center, then pale yellow or [[buff (color)|buff]] from the margin inwards. The cap margin is prominently grooved almost all the way to the center; the grooves mark the positions of the longer [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap. When young, the cap surface is covered with white or whitish shiny particles, remnants of the [[universal veil]] that covers immature specimens.<ref name=Evenson/> The particles are loosely attached and easily washed away, so that older specimens are often smooth.<ref>Buller, 1924, p. 335.</ref> ''Coprinellus micaceus'' is [[hygrophanous]], meaning it assumes different colors depending on its state of hydration.<ref name=McKnight1987/>\n\nThe gills are crowded together closely, and have an [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] (narrow) attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].<ref name=Orr1979/> Initially white, they change color to dark brown then eventually black as the spores mature.

Generally, they are [[wikt:lentiform|lentiform]] (shaped like a biconvex lens), but viewed from the side they appear more almond-shaped or spindle-shaped, while in front view they appear oval or mitriform (roughly the shape of a miter\u2014a peaked cap). Spores have a [[germ pore]], a flattened area in the center of the spore surface through which a [[germ tube]] may emerge.<ref name=Orton1979/> The spore-bearing cells (the [[basidia]]) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 10\u201315 by 4\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Keirle2004/> Studies have shown that the basidia develop in four discrete generations. The first generation basidia are the most protuberant and extend out the greatest distance from the surface of the hymenium. Subsequent generations of basidia have shorter and less protuberant bodies. When a living gill is viewed with a microscope, the four sets of basidia can be seen distinctly. [[Arthur Henry Reginald Buller|Arthur Buller]] coined the term ''[[wikt:inaequihymeniiferous|inaequihymeniiferous]]'' to describe this mode of hymenial development. The purpose of the staggered basidia sizes is to facilitate the release of spores from the hymenium. There are four zones of spore discharge that correspond to the four sets of basidia, and basidia that have released all of their spores quickly begin to autodigest. The staggered setup minimizes the chance of spores colliding with neighboring basidia during release.<ref>Buller, 1924, pp. 351\u201353.</ref>\n\n[[Cystidia]] that are located along the edge of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30\u2013120 by 20\u201374&nbsp;\u00b5m. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are club-shaped or elongated ellipses, up to 130\u2013155&nbsp;\u00b5m in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development.<ref>Buller, 1924, pp. 329, 342.</ref> ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60\u2013100 by 5\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification.<ref name=Keirle2004/> Both [[Heinrich Anton de Bary|De Bary]] and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of [[cytoplasm]] formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes,<ref name=DeBary1873/> but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the [[vacuole]]s enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.<ref>Buller, 1924, pp. 248\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe [[wikt:globular|globular]] cells that make up the mica-resembling scales on the cap are colorless, smooth-walled, and range in size from about 25\u201365&nbsp;\u00b5m, although most are between 40\u201350&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=Bullerp337>Buller, 1924, p. 337.</ref> Buller explained the \"glitter\" of these cells as follows: \"The sparkling of the meal-cells, as well as of the cystidia on the edges and faces of the gills, is simply due to light which strikes them from without and is refracted and reflected to the eye in the same manner as from the minute drops of water one so often sees at the tips of grass leaves on English lawns early in the morning after a dewy night.\"<ref>Buller, 1924, p. 340.</ref>\n\nIn 1914, Michael Levine was the first to report successfully cultivating ''C. micaceus'' from spores in the laboratory.

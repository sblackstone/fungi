Its first known usage was by the natives of [[Central America]] and [[North America]] over 2,000 years ago. Known to the [[Aztecs]] as teonan\u00e1catl from [[Nahuatl]]: ''teotl'' \"god\" + ''nan\u00e1catl'' \"fungus\". This species was categorized by French botanist [[Roger Heim]].<ref name=Heim1957>{{cite journal |author=Heim R. |year=1957 |title=Notes pr\u00e9liminaires sur les agarics hallucinog\u00e8nes du Mexique |trans-title=Preliminary notes on the hallucination-producing agarics of Mexico |journal=Revue de Mycologie |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=58\u201379 |language=French}}</ref>\n\nIt was from this species that Dr. [[Albert Hofmann]], working with specimens grown in his [[Sandoz]] laboratory, first isolated and named the active [[entheogenic]] compounds [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]]. Uncertain of whether or not the artificially cultivated mushrooms would retain their natural psychoactive properties, Dr. Hofmann consumed 32 specimens. The following is his account of the experience, published in his classic text, ''The Botany and Chemistry of Hallucinogens'':\n\n<blockquote>As I was perfectly aware that my knowledge of the Mexican origin of the mushrooms would lead me to imagine only Mexican scenery, I tried deliberately to look on my environment as I knew it normally. But all voluntary efforts to look at things in their customary forms and colours proved ineffective. Whether my eyes were closed or open, I saw only Mexican motifs and colours. When the doctor supervising the experiment bent over me to check my blood pressure, he was transformed into an Aztec priest, and I would not have been astonished if he had drawn an obsidian knife. In spite of the seriousness of the situation, it amused me to see how the Germanic face of my colleague had acquired a purely Indian expression. At the peak of the intoxication, about 1{{frac|1|2}} hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, the rush of interior pictures, mostly changing in shape and colour, reached such an alarming degree that I feared I would be torn into this whirlpool of form and colour and would dissolve. After about six hours, the dream came to an end. Subjectively, I had no idea how long this condition had lasted. I felt my return to everyday reality to be a happy return from a strange, fantastic but quite really experienced world into an old and familiar home.</blockquote>\n\nThis mushroom is in the section ''Mexicanae''. Other mushrooms in this section include ''[[Psilocybe atlantis]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe samuiensis]]''. Ramirez-Cruz ''et al.'' (2013) considered ''[[Psilocybe acutipilea]]'' from [[Brazil]] to be a possible synonym of ''Psilocybe mexicana'', in which case it would be the [[senior synonym]], but the [[type (biology)|type specimen]] was too moldy for them to be certain.<ref name=\"Ramirez-Cruz2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Ram\u00edrez-Cruz |first1=Virginia |last2=Guzm\u00e1n |first2=Gast\u00f3n |last3=Guzm\u00e1n-D\u00e1valos |first3=Laura |title=Type studies of Psilocybe sensu lato (Strophariaceae, Agaricales) |journal=Sydowia |year=2013 |volume=65 |pages=277\u2013319}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pmex-400x-phase.contrast.jpg|thumb|right|''Psilocybe mexicana'' cheilocystidia and spores 400x]]\n*'''Cap''': (0.5)1 \u2014  2(3) cm in diameter, [[conic]] to [[wikt:campanulate|campanulate]] or [[subumbonate]] and often with a slight [[wiktionary:Papilla|papilla]], [[hygrophanous]] or [[wikt:glabrescent|glabrescent]], even to striate at the margin, [[ocherous]] to brown or beige to straw color in age, sometimes with blueish or greenish tones, easily turning blue when injured.\n*'''Gills''': [[Adnation|Adnate]] or [[adnexed]], gray to purple-brown with whitish edges.\n*'''Spore Print''': Dark purple-brown\n*'''Stipe''':  4 \u2014  10(12.5) cm tall x 1 \u2014  2(3) mm thick, equal, hollow, straw color to brownish or reddish-brown, becoming darker where injured, [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]] absent.\n*'''Odor''': [[Farinaceous]]\n*'''Taste''': [[Farinaceous]]\n*'''Microscopic features''': Spores 8 \u2014  12 x 5 \u2014  8 [[\u03bcm]].

Common at elevations between {{convert|300|-|550|m|ft}}, rare in lower elevations, known only from [[Mexico]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Guatemala]]. Fruiting takes place from May to October.\n\n==Consumption and cultivation==\nLike several other [[psilocybin mushrooms]] in the [[genus]], ''Psilocybe mexicana'' has been consumed by indigenous [[North America]]n and [[Central America]]n peoples for its [[entheogen]]ic effects.\n\nIn the Western world, [[sclerotia]] of ''Psilocybe mexicana'' are sometimes cultivated for [[entheogenic]] use. The sclerotia have a lower content of active substances than the actual mushrooms themselves.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Psilocybe.mexicana.la.primavera.jpg|''Psilocybe mexicana'' from Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico\nImage:Psilocybe.mexicana.Alan.jpg|''Psilocybe mexicana'' from Jalisco, Mexico\nFile:Psilocybe.mexicana.Xico.JPG|''Psilocybe mexicana'' from Veracruz, Mexico\nImage:Psilocybe mexicana2.jpg| ''Psilocybe mexicana'' drawing\nImage:2012-07-18 Psilocybe mexicana R.

It is also known as the black chanterelle, black trumpet, trompette de la mort (French), trombetta dei morti (Italian) or trumpet of the dead.\n\nThe [[Cornucopia]], in [[Greek mythology]], referred to the magnificent horn of the nymph [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]]'s goat (or of herself in goat form), that filled itself with whatever meat or drink its owner requested. It has become the symbol of plenty.\n\nA possible origin for the name \"trumpet of the dead\" is that the growing mushrooms were seen as being played as trumpets by dead people under the ground.\n\n==Description==\nThe fruiting body does not have a separation into stalk and cap, but is shaped like a funnel expanded at the top, normally up to about {{convert|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|7|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter<ref name=Phillips/><ref name=\"Courtecuisse2\"/> (but said to grow exceptionally to {{convert|15|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Bon\"/><ref name=\"Courtecuisse1\"/>). The upper and inner surface is black or dark grey, and the lower and outer fertile surface is a much lighter shade of grey. The fertile surface is more or less smooth but may be somewhat wrinkled.\n\nThe size of the elliptical spores is in the range 10\u201317&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] \u00d7 6\u201311&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The basidia are two-spored.\n\n[[File:Craterellus.cornucopioides.1000x.DIC.jpg|thumb|Craterellus cornucopioides Spores 1000x]]\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThis fungus is found in woods in North America, Europe, Japan and Korea.<ref name=GBIF/>  Mainly it grows under beech, oak or other broad-leaved trees, especially in moss in moist spots on heavy [[calcareous]] soil.<ref name=\"Bon\"/><ref name=\"Courtecuisse1\"/>   In Europe it is generally common but seems to be rare in some countries such as the Netherlands. It appears from June to November,<ref name=\"Courtecuisse2\"/> and in the UK, from August to November.\n\nThe mushroom is usually almost black, and it is hard to find because its dark colour easily blends in with the leaf litter on the forest floor. Hunters of this mushroom say it is like looking for black holes in the ground.<ref name=Kuo1/>\n\n==Related species==\n[[File:2010-08-24 Craterellus cinereus (Pers.) Qu\u00e9l 100703 cropped.jpg|thumb|130px|left|''Cantharellus cinereus'']]\n''Craterellus cornucopioides'' has a smooth spore-bearing surface, but the rare and not very closely related ''[[Cantharellus cinereus]]'' has rudimentary gills.<ref name=\"Bon\"/>  The colour and smooth undersurface make ''C. cornucopioides'' very distinctive.\n\nThe forms ''[[Craterellus fallax]]'' (with a different spore colour ''en masse'') and ''[[Craterellus konradii]]'' (with a yellowish fruiting body) have been defined as separate species, but DNA studies now show that the latter should be considered part of ''C. cornucopioides'' <ref name=Kuo2/><ref name=C_fallax/>\n\n==Edibility==\n[[File:Trompettes de la mort - 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Trumpets drying on a string.]]\nHorns of plenty are edible and sought after. According to a Portuguese study, 100 [[grams]] of dried ''C. cornucopioides'' contain 69.45 g of [[protein]], 13.44 g of carbohydrates (mostly [[mannitol]], a [[sugar alcohol]]) and 4.88 g of [[fat]], amounting to 378 [[calories]]. They contain [[fatty acids]], primarily of the [[polyunsaturated]] variety, as well as [[phenols]], [[flavonoids]] and 87&nbsp;mg of [[vitamin C]].<ref name=\"Food and Chemical Toxicology\">{{cite journal|last=Barros|first=Lillian |author2=Telma Cruz |author3=Paula Baptista |author4=Leticia M.
